item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to implement critical accounting policies and to make estimates that could significantly influence the results of operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates  which significantly influence the results of the company s operations and its financial position  include revenue recognition policies  the valuation allowance for inventories and accounts receivable  evaluation of the impairment of and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  and estimates for future losses on product warranties 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from three sources system sales  part sales  and services 
for system sales and parts sales  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the contract price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company s sales are typically not subject to rights of return  and  historically  sales returns have not been significant 
system sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  and that involve installation services are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and recognized when the installation is complete 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements  such as accessories ordered by customers  is deferred until the related items are delivered to the customer 
for certain other system sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is generally deferred until customer acceptance 
deferred revenue from such system sales is presented as unearned revenues in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our products generally carry one year of warranty 
once the warranty period has expired  the customer may purchase an extended product warranty typically covering an additional period of one year 
extended warranty billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term 
revenue from extended warranties is deferred and recognized ratably over the duration of the contract 
unearned extended warranty revenue is included in unearned revenues in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments and for estimated sales returns 
customers may not make payments or may return products due to a variety of reasons including deterioration of their financial condition or dissatisfaction with the company s products 
management makes regular assessments of doubtful accounts and uses the best information available  including correspondence with customers and credit reports 
if the company determines that there is impairment in the ability to collect payments from customers  additional allowances may be required 
certain distributors or manufacturer s representatives in growing geographic areas  on management approval  may exceed credit limits to accommodate financial growth 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses  but the company could experience increased losses if general economic conditions of its significant customers or any of the markets in which it sells its products were to deteriorate 
this could result in the impairment of a number of its customers ability to meet their obligations  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories consist of electronic equipment and various components 
the company operates in an industry where technological advances or new product introductions are a frequent occurrence 
either one of these occurrences can significantly impair customer demand for a portion of the company s inventory on hand  making it obsolete 
the company regularly evaluates its inventory and maintains a reserve for inventory obsolescence and excess inventory 
as a policy  the company provides a reserve for products with no movement in six months or more and which management determines  based on available market information  are no longer saleable 
the company also applies subjective judgment in the evaluation of the recoverability of the rest of its inventory based upon known and expected market conditions and company plans 
if the company s competitors were to introduce a new technology or product that renders a product sold by the company obsolete or unnecessary  it could have a significant adverse effect on the company s future operating results and financial position 
the company had changes in required reserves in recent periods due to discontinuation of certain product lines and obsolescence related to new product introductions  as well as declining market conditions 
as a result  the company incurred net inventory charges of approximately  during fiscal  approximately  during fiscal and approximately  in fiscal intangible assets the company s intangible assets primarily include product patents 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january   as required 
accordingly  the company reviews the recoverability and estimated useful lives of other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during the quarter ended september   the company completed an evaluation of the future prospects of certain products and determined that certain related intangible assets amounting to approximately  were impaired and written off by a charge to expense for the period ended december  the intangible assets acquired from iii in december consisted of patents and licenses 
the majority of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research development as the technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
product warranties products are sold with warranties ranging from days to one year  and extended warranties may be purchased for some products 
the company establishes a reserve for warranty expenditures and then adjusts the amount of reserve  annually  if actual warranty experience is different than accrued 
the company makes estimates of these costs based on historical experience and on various other assumptions including historical and expected product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of the company s operations for each of the past three years 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
for the years ended december  percentage percentage increase increase decrease decrease total net revenues    total cost of revenues    gross profit    selling  general  and administrative expenses    research and development expenses    acquired in process research and development impairment of intangible assets operating income   interest and other income loss from unconsolidated investee impairment of investment in unconsolidated investee income before income taxes   provision for income taxes net income   diluted earnings per share compared to net revenues total net revenues for the year ended december  increased  or  to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
net revenues increased due to strong sales of the company s new eclipse purge and trap sample concentrator  minicams air monitoring systems  continuous flow analyzers  the lan beverage analyzer  and total organic carbon analyzers toc 
in our lan on line beverage monitor sales increased  and were highlighted by a sales win to install new monitors at a major soft drink producer s premier bottling plant located near its headquarters 
the lan measures brix  diet  and carbon dioxide in beverage process streams 
the eclipse  our new generation p t sample concentrator  was well accepted by customers in  including the china environmental protection agency 
we continued to add accessories to the product line  including two autosamplers  one for water and one for a combination of water and soil  an automated multipoint process sampler amps module for hour automated monitoring of municipal or process water supplies  and a productivity enhancing device  the ph express tm 
both domestic revenues and international revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the prior year 
international revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues  as sales into europe and asia increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the prior year 
during the second quarter of  the company increased its presence in asia by opening a representative office in china 
we believe that china is a growing market and opening this office will better position the company to compete for business in china 
increases in revenues from products were partially offset by decreases in revenues from services 
revenues from services decreased  or to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
revenues from services decreased  compared to the same period of the prior year  primarily due to lower revenues from field repair and installation services 
although net revenues may have increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the prior year  the environmental instrument market has been flat or declining over the past several years 
furthermore  improvement in the performance of some products is still offset by the below expectations performance of certain other products 
the company continues to encounter strong competition and continues to seek improved distribution strategies for certain products in some channels and markets 
we remain cautiously optimistic about future sales and have identified a number of products and strategies we believe will allow us to grow our business despite this decline  including the acquisition of complementary businesses  the development of new products  development of new applications for our technologies  and the strengthening of our presence in selected geographic markets 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or if successfully implemented  that these strategies will result in growth of the company s business 
neither inflation nor changing prices have had a material impact on the company s net revenues over the past three fiscal years 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
gross profit represented of revenues for the year ended december   and for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in gross profit for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the prior year  was primarily due to an increase in revenues and improved product mix with more sales of higher margin  newer products manufactured by the company  and less sales of gas chromatography equipment purchased under an original equipment manufacturers supply agreement 
research and development r d expenses r d expenses for the year ended december  increased  or to  compared to expenses of  for the same period of the prior year 
r d expenses represented of revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in r d expenses for the year ended december  was due to a plan to focus on product development  which was announced in the second quarter of the plan stated our intention to intensify our r d efforts on updating existing products and to develop new products to serve markets with growth potential greater than the environmental testing market 
as stated previously  r d spending will likely increase over historical levels as a dollar amount  and as a percentage of revenues 
at this time  we plan to remain committed to this plan even at the risk of incurring an operating loss on a quarterly or annual basis 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses for the year ended december  increased  or to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year  primarily due to increases in compensation and other related expenses  bad debt expense  accounting and other professional fees 
sg a expense increased in dollars  as well as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  to compared to in acquired in process research and development on december   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of iii  including intellectual property owned and licensed by iii  and prototype products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail of the transaction 
the purchase price was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including the in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we expensed the entire amount of the in process research and development of  at the date of the acquisition 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of acquired in process research and development are as follows project name portable gc mass spectrometer percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue calendar year the development of the acquired technology into a commercial product or products remains highly dependent on the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for a new product  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop this technology into a commercially viable product consists primarily of research planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure of our research efforts to prove that the technology will function for the intended purpose or to bring a product to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on the future prospects of these r d efforts 
first period of expected revenues should not be relied on as a commitment or indication of product introduction date 
subsequent to the acquisition of these assets  there have been no significant developments related to the current status of the acquired in process research and development that would result in material changes to the assumptions 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from a product or products based on this technology will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the purchase was completed and may result in impairment charges to the  of other intangible assets acquired 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased  or to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in operating income for the year ended december  is primarily due to the increase in revenues from product sales partially offset by an increase in r d activity  sg a expenditures  and from iii in process research and development expense acquired 
interest and other income other income  net  which is comprised of interest and dividend income from investments  interest income from customer leases  and gain loss from dispositions of company property  increased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year  primarily due to more interest income from investments 
loss from and impairment of investment in unconsolidated investee we incurred a loss of  relating to the write off of the losses from our investment in iii  an unconsolidated investee  an investment which was a condition precedent to entering into the product purchase agreement 
the company recognized a  impairment charge relating to its investment in the unconsolidated investee during the quarter ended september   due to an other than temporary decline in its fair value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income before income taxes income before income taxes for the year ended december  decreased  or to  compared to income of  for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease in income before income taxes for the year ended december   was primarily due to losses relating to the company s investment in iii amounting to approximately  offsetting the increase in operating income 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased  for the year ended december  to a provision of  compared to  for the same period of the prior year

cash flow used in investing activities in of  an increase of  compared to  in  was primarily due to the purchase of other investments 
the company considers investment alternatives and invests surplus cash in low risk  short term investments of varying maturities or investment grade preferred stock to maximize return while maintaining investment risk at a minimum 
the company invested a portion of its available cash in such investments during  and to maintain its liquidity  however  the investment in iii was part of an arrangement to develop and gain access to technology for use in potential new products and not as an income earning asset  such as the company s other investment grade preferred stocks 
net cash flows provided by used in financing activities for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of the prior year

aggregate contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases    purchase obligations   total    future minimum rental payments under an operating lease for some leased facilities expiring december these amounts do not include a six month prepaid operating lease for office space in seattle  washington 
open purchase orders primarily for raw materials  component parts  and other supplies that the company uses to manufacture its products 
we have historically been able to fund working capital and capital expenditures from operations  and expect to be able to finance our working capital requirements from cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
however  demand for our products is influenced by the overall condition of the economy in which we sell our products  by the capital spending budgets of our customers and by our ability to successfully meet our customers expectations 
the environmental instrument market in which we compete has been flat or declining over the past several years 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our results of operations and  therefore  harm the primary source of our cash flows 
other matters that could affect the extent of funds required within the short term and long term include future acquisitions of other businesses or product lines  extensive investment in product r d activities  or spending to develop markets for our products 
we may engage in discussions with third parties to acquire new products or businesses or to form strategic alliances and joint ventures 
these types of transactions may require additional funds from sources other than current operations 
should the need arise  we would attempt to obtain such funds from traditional institutional debt financing or other third party financing 
the company s initiative in to obtain a mass selective detector for use in a new product led to the strategic alliance with iii and our investment in and funding of iii s development 
with the purchase of the assets of iii  the company anticipates spending at least  to complete the development of a commercial product or products based on the technology and incorporate that technology into our products 
the company anticipates using its own employees and certain key contractors to attempt to complete the product development 
such research efforts are experimental and may cost more than planned 
nevertheless  we believe that we have the working capital to maintain our commitment to this development effort 
in the second quarter of  we announced a plan to undertake a more extensive research  development  and engineering effort with the intent of developing products with innovative technologies 
the major goals in our efforts are i to position the company to serve new markets  ii to increase our position in the beverage market  and iii to broaden our product offering in the process analytical instruments market 
our plan to increase research and development will increase r d expenses 
such expenses will include hiring additional personnel  purchasing supplies and component products for experimental use  outsourcing certain work  and using consulting services 
we expect that such expenses will fluctuate quarterly based on the specific activity during the quarter 
such fluctuating expenditures  together with fluctuating revenues  may result in a quarterly or annual operating loss 
we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and funds from operations to maintain our commitment to this plan 
the company invests excess funds generated from operations in money market funds  treasury bills and investment grade securities rated by moody s or standard poor s 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities and preferred stocks with at least an investment grade rating to minimize credit risk 
these investments are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s investments in debt and equity securities at december  was  and the fair value at december  was  year to date unrealized losses in the fair value of some of those investments are primarily due to recent increases in interest rates 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold 
approximately  was realized as a loss on the sales of such investments during since  the company has repurchased an aggregate of  shares of treasury stock at an average purchase price of per share  pursuant to the company s stock repurchase program 
no repurchases were made in  but the company may purchase up to an additional  shares under the current stock repurchase program 
the company may seek an expansion of this program in the future if it believes repurchases continue to be in the best interests of the company 
expansion of this program would also be funded from cash from operations 
the company conducts some operations in leased facilities under an operating lease expiring on november   and a six month  prepaid lease for office space in seattle  washington 
future minimum rental payments under this lease are  for and  for segment information the company manages its businesses primarily on a product and services basis 
the company reports its operations as a single segment

our failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting but we are still exposed to potential risks resulting from new requirements that we evaluate the effectiveness of such internal controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of as a non accelerated filer  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we include in our annual report on form k for december  our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent auditors will be required to attest to whether our assessment is free of material misstatement and documented in an acceptable form and separately report on whether they believe we maintain  in all material respects  effective control over financial reporting as of december  we are currently documenting our internal control systems and procedures and implementing improvements in order to comply with the assessment and attestation requirements of section the evaluation and attestation processes required by section are new and neither companies nor independent auditors have significant experience in testing or complying with these requirements 
accordingly  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements  the receipt of a report of our independent auditors indicating that management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting is free of material misstatement and is adequately documented  and the receipt of a separate report of our independent auditors that we maintain effective internal controls 
while we currently anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements of section  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or our independent auditors audit thereof 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section the impact thereof on our future financial performance and the market price of our stock is uncertain  and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission or the nasdaq 
future changes in financial accounting standards or taxation rules may adversely affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significant effect on our reported results 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
these new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
under the newly issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  we will be required to account for equity under our stock plans as a compensation expense  and our net income and net income per share will be reduced 
currently  we record compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value 
for option grants that have an exercise price at fair market value  we calculate compensation expense and disclose their impact on net income loss and net income loss per share  as well as the impact of all stock based compensation expense in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires the company to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our fourth quarter of  and will require the company to expense shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights  as compensation cost 
the company s purchase of substantially all of the assets of iii may not result in a successful product 
in december  the company completed the purchase of certain assets of iii  including intellectual property owned and licensed by iii  prototype products  software  and research assets for use in the development of a portable gc ms product 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established  and the technology had no alternative future use 
the development of the technology into a commercial product or products remains highly dependent on the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for a new product  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop this technology into a commercially viable product consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring the product to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on the future prospects of these r d efforts 
subsequent to the acquisition  there have been no significant developments related to the current status of the acquired in process research and development projects that would result in material changes to the assumptions 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from a product or products based on the acquired iii technology will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the purchase was completed and may result in impairment charges 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
the company s increased r d efforts may not result in products that are successful in the marketplace 
during  the company announced its plan to increase spending on r d for potential new products 
the company feels that to maintain its market share for existing products and to gain market share in new markets such as homeland security  that it must increase its r d spending 
the company expects its r d expense to be higher than its historical average 
such r d spending may involve new technology or updates of existing technology 
there is no assurance that such r d efforts to develop new technology will be successful  or that if r d efforts do yield new products  that such products will be successful in the marketplace once introduced 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the industries  into which it sells its products  demand fewer products similar to products sold by the company 
visibility into our markets is limited 
any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services 
the environmental instrument markets  in which the company competes  have been flat or declining over the past several years 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and stock price 
the company has identified a number of strategies it believes will allow it to grow its business despite this decline  including acquiring complementary businesses  developing new applications for its technologies  and strengthening its presence in selected geographic markets 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or if successfully implemented  that these strategies will result in growth of the company s business 
our acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
the company s success is highly dependent upon implementation of its acquisition strategy 
certain businesses acquired and strategic alliances by the company in the past years have produced net operating losses or low levels of profitability  including the strategic alliance with intelligent ion  inc and the acquisition of general analysis corporation 
businesses the company may seek to acquire in the future may also be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
for any acquired business to achieve the level of profitability desired by the company  the company must successfully change the acquired companies operations and improve their market penetration 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in this regard 
in addition  promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete pending or future acquisitions 
in order to finance such acquisitions  it may be necessary for the company to raise additional funds either through public or private financing 
debt financing  if available  may be on terms that are unfavorable to the company  and equity financing may result in significant dilution to the company s shareholders 
as a result of such transactions  the company s financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require the company to integrate a different company culture  management team  and business infrastructure 
the company may have difficulty developing  manufacturing  and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of its combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  the company s successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including  the retention of key employees  the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the retention of key customers  and the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs  and facilities 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources that may divert the company s attention from other business operations 
if the company does not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  and stock price could be negatively impacted 
technological change could cause the company s products to become non competitive or obsolete 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid and significant technological change and evolving industry standards 
new product introductions responsive to these factors require significant planning  design  development  and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels  and may render existing products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not become noncompetitive or obsolete 
in addition  industry acceptance of new technologies developed by the company may be slow to develop due to  among other things  existing regulations that apply specifically to older technologies and the general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies 
consolidation in the environmental instrument market and changes in environmental regulations could adversely affect the company s business 
one of the important markets for the company s products is environmental analysis 
during the past five years  there has been a contraction in the market for analytical instruments used for environmental analysis 
this contraction has caused consolidation in the companies serving this market 
such consolidation may have an adverse impact on certain businesses of the company 
in addition  most air  water  and soil analyses are conducted to comply with federal  state  local  and foreign environmental regulations 
these regulations are frequently specific as to the type of technology required for a particular analysis and the level of detection required for that analysis 
the company develops  configures  and markets its products to meet customer needs created by existing and anticipated environmental regulations 
these regulations may be amended or eliminated in response to new scientific evidence or political or economic considerations 
any significant change in environmental regulations could result in a reduction in demand for the company s products 
reduced capital spending by the company s customers could harm its business 
the company s customers include various government agencies and public and private research institutions  which accounted for of the company s sales in  as well as pharmaceutical and chemical companies and laboratories 
the capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for the company s products 
such spending is based on a wide variety of factors  including the resources available to make purchases  the spending priorities among various types of equipment  public policy  political trends  and the effects of different economic cycles 
any decrease in capital spending by any of the customer groups  which account for a significant portion of the company s sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s results of operations are dependent on its relationship with agilent technologies  inc 
agilent 
prior to december   the company had a value added reseller var agreement with agilent that was not renewed by agilent 
agilent cited the increasing competitive nature of the company s products with their products as the reason for not renewing the var agreement 
on december   the company entered into an oem agreement with agilent  subsequently renewed in december   and the original equipment manufacturers oem agreement does not provide for marketing cooperation  and therefore  the company and agilent compete for the same business 
no assurances can be made that agilent will renew the oem agreement  nor that the company will sustain sales levels in the future under the agilent oem agreement 
as the company continues to evaluate its alternatives  it may be determined that continuing the oem agreement is not its best strategy 
the oem agreement is renewable on an annual basis  and there is no assurance that it will be renewed in future years 
failure to renew the agreement would place at risk a substantial part of the company s sales of gc systems and would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with governmental regulations could subject the company to significant expense 
the company has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the company is also subject to investigation for compliance with the terms of government contracts 
non compliance  although inadvertent  may result in legal proceedings or liability  which may be significant 
several of the company s product lines are subject to significant international  federal  state  local  health  safety  packaging  product content  and labor regulations 
in addition  many of the company s products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  requiring compliance with additional regulations in marketing these products 
significant expenses may be incurred to comply with these regulations or remedy past violations of these regulations 
any failure to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of portions or all of the company s operations  impositions of fines  and restrictions on the ability to carry on or expand operations 
environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject the company to substantial liabilities in the future 
some of the company s manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international  federal  state  and local laws governing the environment 
the company could be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination  and these liabilities may be substantial 
although the company s policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at its sites inside and outside the united states  even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments  the company may not be aware of all conditions that could subject it to liability 
compliance with governmental regulations may cause the company to incur significant expenses  and failure to maintain compliance with certain governmental regulations may have a negative impact on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to various significant international  federal  state  and local  health and safety  packaging  product content  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the company s chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test compliance with the toxic substances control act  the food  drug  and cosmetic act  and similar regulations 
therefore  the company must continually adapt its chemical analysis products to changing regulations 
the company may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by the company to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of its operations or portions of its operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on its ability to carry on or expand its operations 
in addition  because many of the company s products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  it must comply with additional regulations in marketing its products 
the company s products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation of other agencies such as the u 
s 
federal communications commission 
the company also must comply with work safety rules 
if the company fails to adequately address any of these regulations  its business will be harmed 
economic  political  and other risks associated with international sales could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
sales outside the u 
s 
accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in the future 
sales to the company s international customers are subject to a number of risks including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of finished goods to its customers  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in political or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  negative consequences from changes in tax laws  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company faces competition from third parties in the sale of its products 
the company encounters and expects to continue to encounter intense competition in the sale of its products 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for its products include product performance  price  reliability  and customer service 
the company s competitors include large multinational corporations and operating units of such corporations 
most of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than those of the company 
therefore  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products  products under development  or ability to discover new technologies will be sufficient to enable it to compete effectively with its competitors 
the company could incur substantial costs in protecting and defending its intellectual property  and loss of patent rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company holds patents relating to various aspects of its products and believes that proprietary technical know how is critical to many of its products 
proprietary rights relating to the company s products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to the company or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in the absence of patent protection  the company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy the company s products or gain access to its trade secrets and technical know how 
proceedings initiated by the company to protect its proprietary rights could result in substantial costs to the company 
there can be no assurance that competitors of the company will not initiate litigation to challenge the validity of the company s patents  or that they will not use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe upon the company s patents 
there may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with the company that relate to the company s products or technologies 
the company may need to acquire licenses to  or contest the validity of  any such patents 
there can be no assurance that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms or that the company would prevail in any such contest 
the company could incur substantial costs in defending itself in suits brought against it or in suits in which the company may assert its patent rights against others 
if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to the company  the company s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company relies on trade secrets and proprietary technical know how that it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its collaborators  employees  and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
the company s fluctuating quarterly operating results may negatively impact stock price 
the company cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause adjustments to the company s operations 
since a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to significant cost to maintain customer support  research and development and manufacturing costs  relatively small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect the company s quarterly operating results  and in turn  cause declines in the company s stock price 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include lower demand for and market acceptance of products due to adverse changes in economic activity or conditions in the company s major markets  lower selling prices due to competitive pressures  unanticipated delays  problems  or increased costs in the introduction of new products or manufacture of existing products  changes in the relative portion of revenue represented by the company s various products and customers  and competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations 
any one of these factors  individually or in combination  could cause the stock price of the company to fluctuate greatly 
although inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations  there is no assurance that inflation will not adversely affect its operations in the future 
the company believes that competition based on price is a significant factor affecting its customers buying decisions 
there is no assurance that the company can pass along cost increases in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that have been achieved in prior years 
the prices of some components purchased by the company have increased in the past several years due in part to decreased volume 
certain other material and labor costs have also increased  but the company believes that these increases are approximately consistent with overall inflation rates 
competing companies are larger  better trained  and they cover larger areas geographically 
failure of suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely manner could cause the company to lose sales and  in turn  adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company may be materially and adversely impacted if sufficient parts are not received in time to meet manufacturing requirements 
factors that may result in manufacturing delays include certain parts that may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers  key components may become unavailable and may be difficult to replace without significant reengineering of the company s products  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies  or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
should the company reduce purchase orders to its suppliers and its sales increase rapidly  its suppliers may not react quickly enough or may refuse to expedite shipments of parts to use because of the company s previous reduction in requirements 
if sufficient parts are not received in time to meet manufacturing requirements  then the company will not be able to meet its obligations to deliver goods to its customers and may cause the company to lose sales 
the company s inability to adjust its orders for parts or adapt its manufacturing capacity in response to changing market conditions could adversely affect the company s earnings 
the company s earnings could be harmed if it is unable to adjust its orders for parts to respond to market fluctuations 
in order to secure components for the production of products  the company may enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors  or at times make advance payments to suppliers  which could impact its ability to adjust its inventory to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for certain of the company s products has decreased 
if the demand for the company s products continues to decrease  it may experience an excess of parts and be forced to incur additional charges 
certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to substitute without significant reengineering of the company s products 
suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies  or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
additionally  because the company cannot immediately adapt its production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet the company s expectations  its manufacturing capacity will likely exceed its production requirements 
if the company suffers loss to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  terrorism  or other natural or man made disasters 
our production facilities and corporate headquarters are located in college station  texas  and we also have production facilities in alabama 
if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments  and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities 
although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 
the introduction of new products results in risks relating to start up of such products  customer acceptance  employee training  distributor training  and phase out of old products 
the development and introduction of new products requires the execution of a number of steps  any one of which if not executed properly can result in lost sales  market share  and damage to our reputation all of which might result in operating losses and  accordingly  our stock price could decline
