table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview american land lease is in the business of owning and leasing residential land 
our current business focuses on the ownership of land and generation of these leases within adult or retirement communities of our total home sites at december   we focus on these communities for the following reasons current demographic projections predict that the customer base for this asset class will grow for the next years 
the residents have established credit histories and therefore are able to obtain favorable financing or pay cash for their home making significant equity investments to improve the leasehold estate that secures our lease 
the residents  as a result of their retired or semi retired status  are less affected by current economic changes thereby making their continued rental payments more stable and the continued sales of homes in our communities more consistent year to year 
the company is able to leverage its current marketing  brand  and management expertise 
the company seeks growth through home sales to fill unoccupied home sites in current subdivisions  development of its land portfolio to increase the inventory of available home sites  and the selective acquisition of communities and development opportunities 
this business model presents a number of challenges and risks for the company s management 
several of these risks are the continued development of additional home sites is a capital intensive activity that requires substantial investments to be made in advance of returns 
older homes may depreciate or become obsolete 
changes in the interest rate environment may have an adverse impact our new home sales customers ability to realize sufficient proceeds from the sale of their present homes or finance new purchases  therefore limiting their financial ability to acquire new homes in our communities 
the cost of developing additional home sites and communities may increase at a rate or to a level that may exceed the costs projected at the point of the initial investment by the company 
based upon the above and other factors  the rate of sale of new homes may be substantially slower than projected at the point of the initial investment by the company  resulting in returns on investment materially different from original projections 
there are additional challenges that might occur as a result of the hurricane season our resident s homes may have damage that exceeds the insurance proceeds available under their homeowner s policies  thereby limiting residents ability to restore their home to its pre hurricane condition 
in some instances  this may result in a temporary loss of occupancy 
this occupancy loss may be insured under the company s business interruption policies 
the extent of claims made against properties in our asset class may have a material impact on the cost of insurance for both the company and our residents  thereby increasing the company s operating costs at a rate in excess of rental rate increases and limiting our resident s ability to reinvest in their homes at the same rate enjoyed before the hurricanes 
the severity and number of hurricanes that impacted florida may result in a slowing rate of new customers to buy homes on our expansion sites  thereby reducing rate of absorption and lowering the company s return on investment 

table of contents the costs of hurricane clean up and repair may not be fully covered by insurance policies  resulting in higher than projected capital spending 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note b to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of long lived assets real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation  unless considered impaired 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired  we will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows  excluding interest charges  of the property 
in the event the property is under development  the estimate of future cash flows includes all future expenditures necessary to develop the property 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate future cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the property 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include changes in the national  regional and local economic climates  local conditions  such as an oversupply of residential land lease properties or a reduction in the demand for our residential land lease properties  competition from other housing sources including single and multifamily properties  plus changes in market rental rates 
additional factors that may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our development properties include regulatory changes that impact the number of home sites that can be built on our undeveloped land  changes in projected costs to construct new subdivisions in our communities and regulatory changes made by local  regional  state or national authorities 
any adverse changes in these factors could cause impairment in our real estate 
capitalized costs we capitalize direct and indirect costs including interest  real estate taxes  and other costs in connection with initial capital expenditures  capital enhancements  and capital replacements  as well as similar spending for development and redevelopment of our properties 
indirect costs that are not capitalized  including general and administrative expenses  are charged to expense as incurred 
the amounts capitalized vary with the volume  cost and timing of these activities and  especially  with the pace of development and redevelopment activities 
as a result  changes in the volume  cost and timing of these activities may have a significant impact on our financial results 
the most significant capitalized cost is interest 
we capitalize interest when the following three conditions are present i expenditures for the asset have been made  ii activities necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use are in progress and iii interest cost is being incurred 
our determination of the activities in progress for a development property is subject to professional judgment 
the most significant judgment is the determination to capitalize interest relating to the ownership of land being developed as new home sites 
in many cases  the development activity is expected to take place over several years and in multiple phases 
it is our conclusion that the entirety of each parcel is under development and is a qualifying asset 
accordingly  interest is capitalized with respect to the entire parcel until such time as development activities cease or the individual home site is ready for its intended use 
during   and  capitalized interest was approximately   and  respectively 
we regularly review the amount of capitalized costs in conjunction with our review of impairment of long lived assets 
based on the level of development activity in  if our development activities decrease such that of our assets qualifying for capitalization of interest 
table of contents are no longer qualified  the amount of capitalized interest would have been reduced by  reducing capitalized interest would increase interest expense  resulting in lower net income  which would be offset in future periods by lower depreciation expense 
fair value of financial instruments the aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents  receivables  payables and short term secured debt as of december  approximates their carrying value due to their relatively short term nature 
management further believes that the fair value of our variable rate secured long term debt approximates carrying value 
for the fixed rate secured long term debt  fair values have been based upon estimates using present value techniques 
these techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used  including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows 
in that regard  the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes and  in many cases  may not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument 
the estimated fair value of the company s secured long term notes payable was  and  at december  and  respectively  as compared to the carrying value of  and  at december  and  respectively 
rental property depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for land improvements  to years for buildings and years for furniture and other equipment  all of which are judgmental determinations 
these determinations may prove to be different than the actual life of any individual asset 
inventory carrying amounts for inventory are determined on a specific identification basis and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  if customer preferences change  or if material improvements are made by suppliers that are preferred by our customers compared to inventory we own  inventory write downs may be required 
any such write downs may have a significant impact on our financial results 
on a quarterly basis  we review each home in inventory that is older than one year and evaluate our carrying amount versus recent offers  comparable sales  and our asking price in order to derive an estimate of its market value 
in the event that the carrying amount exceeds our estimate of market value  less a normalized margin  we record a write down of the carrying amount as a charge to the cost of home sales in the current period 
as of december    of our total inventory of  was older than one year 
for the years ended december  and we recorded charges of  and  respectively to write down carrying amounts to market value 
if the company s estimate of fair market value was overstated by  the company would record an additional write down to fair market value  less a normalized margin  of  based upon the carrying value of inventory as of december  legal contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions and the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings 
the amount of loss contingencies involving litigation  for which a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated  is determined through consultation with legal counsel representing the company 
our evaluation of loss contingencies arising from litigation  claims and assessments  considers unasserted claims and associated estimates of loss  if any  are provided to the extent probable and reasonably estimable

table of contents nol carryover at december   the company s net operating loss nol carryover was approximately  for the parent reit entity and  for the company s taxable subsidiaries that are consolidated for financial reporting  but not for federal income tax purposes 
subject to certain limitations  the reit s nol carryover may be used to offset all or a portion of the company s reit taxable income  and as a result  to reduce the amount that the company is required to distribute to stockholders to maintain our status as a reit 
it does not  however  affect the tax treatment to shareholders of any distributions that the company does make 
the parent reit s and the taxable subsidiaries nol carryovers are scheduled to expire between and  and and  respectively 
dividends and distributions during the year ended december   we distributed  per share to holders of common stock and op units  compared to distributions in the year ended december  of  per share and distributions in the year ended december  distributions of  per share 
the tax treatment to shareholders of the dividends paid  if any  is generally determined based upon the character and amount of our taxable income for the relevant year 
for income tax purposes  dividends to common stockholders consist of ordinary income  capital gains including unrecaptured gain under section of the code  which is taxable to shareholders who are individuals at a maximum federal rate of  return of capital or a combination thereof 
for the years ended december   and  dividends paid per share were taxable as follows amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage return of capital ordinary income total our dividend is set quarterly by our board of directors and is subject to change or elimination at any time 
our primary financial objective is to maximize long term  risk adjusted returns on investment for shareholders 
while dividend policy is considered within the context of this objective  maintenance of past dividend levels is not our primary investment objective and is subject to numerous factors including our profitability  capital expenditure plans  obligations related to principal payments and capitalized interest  and the availability of debt and equity capital at terms deemed attractive by us to finance these expenditures 
subject to certain limitations  our nol may be used to offset all or a portion of our reit taxable income  which may allow us to reduce or eliminate our dividends paid and still maintain our reit status 
historically  the combination of dividend payments  capital expenditures  capitalized interest and debt repayment has exceeded funds provided from operating activities and we have funded a portion of these expenditures from debt financings 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so on terms deemed acceptable in the future 
in the event that we are unable to do so or decide not to pursue such financing source  we will be required to reduce or eliminate the dividend  reduce or eliminate capital expenditures  or both 
we initiated the dividend reinvestment plan the plan on may  that allows shareholders to acquire additional shares of common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends paid on our outstanding common stock 
in addition  under the plan  monthly optional cash investments  which are subject to a minimum purchase amount of and a maximum quarterly purchase limit of  per shareholder  are permitted without approval from the board of directors 
optional cash investments in excess of  per shareholder are subject to approval by the board of directors and no such investments were approved during the 
table of contents years ended december   and shares may be acquired pursuant to the plan directly from us at a price equal to the average of the daily high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange during the ten trading days prior to the date of the investment  less a possible discount determined by us of up to  generally without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge by the investor 
during  and  approximately   and  shares of common stock were issued  respectively  pursuant to the plan 
we suspended the plan on april  returns from home sales business we engage in the home sales business for four reasons to lease expansion home sites within our portfolio  thereby increasing the profitability and value of our communities  to upgrade existing leased home sites with new and more valuable homes  thereby increasing the long term value of the lease income stream  to broker the resale of homes in order to support investment values in the homes and to attract good neighbors all so as to promote the long term values of the communities  both for the residents who are our customers and for the long term growth and security of our own investment  and to resell any homes we acquire as a result of defaults in lease obligations owed to us 
we measure the profitability of developing and leasing expansion home sites within our portfolio through identifying the following an estimate of the first year annualized profit on the leases originated on expansion home sites  an estimate of the value of the expansion sites leased less all current and projected development costs  and an estimate of the home sales profit or loss attributable to new homes sold on expansion sites  without consideration for the other aspects of the home sales business 
we believe that our projection of the first year returns from the leases originated on expansion home sites provides the user of our financial statements with a comparison of the profitability of the new leased sites to alternative investments in stabilized communities 
our calculation of estimated first year annualized profit on leases originated on expansion home sites is based upon a non generally accepted accounting principles financial measure 
we project the amount of variable property operating expenses we will incur as a result of the newly leased home sites 
in order to project our variable operating expenses  we begin with operating expenses determined under generally accepted accounting principles and deduct those expenses we believe will not increase with the addition of newly leased sites 
the most directly comparable financial measure that can be reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles is our historical return on investment in operational home sites  which is reconciled on page in footnote our presentation of the estimated first year return on the expansion home sites cannot be directly reconciled to a comparable measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  principally because there are leases that began during the period and we estimate the incremental operating expenses associated with these leases 
the estimated first year annualized return on investment in expansion home sites should not be considered in isolation from nor is it intended to represent an alternative measure of operating income or cash flow or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
by comparing the estimated first year annualized profit on the expansion home site leases originated to the sum of total development costs  as increased in the event of a home sales loss or decreased in the event of a home sales profit by the estimated home sales profit or loss  we are able to measure the estimated first year annualized return on our investment in expansion home sites 
we believe that this measure provides a useful comparison to the returns available from investing in stabilized communities 

table of contents our calculation of an estimated first year annualized return on investment of new home sales includes the following components a we derive our estimated first year annualized profit on leases originated on expansion home sites by deducting estimated operating expenses from the contractual annual revenues from leases originated during the period 
we estimate operating expenses using one half of the actual ratio of property operating expenses incurred to property revenue generated in the prior year 
for example  if we originate a lease at a property where the ratio of operating expense to property revenues was for the prior year  we apply a expense ratio to project the additional expense associated with the newly leased home site for the first year 
we believe that one half of the actual expenses is an appropriate estimate of the relationship between fixed and variable expenses of operating our communities 
b the total development costs of the expansion sites leased are based upon the sum of land  construction costs  and other capitalized costs  including interest expense  as allocated to the individual home sites based upon the leased value of each home site 
c we determine the home sales profit or loss that is attributable to sale of homes situated on expansion home sites by deducting from the reported home sales operating income the gross margin and commissions attributable to the i sale of new homes on existing leased sites  ii the sale of used homes  and iii brokerage of home sale transactions between third parties 
we make no allocation of sales overhead to the transactions identified above 
we believe that our home sales operations drive our estimated first year annualized return on investment in expansion home sites because most of our expansion home site leases originate with our sale of a home

funds from operations we measure our economic profitability based on ffo  less annual capital replacement spending for developed home sites 
for the year ended december   our capital replacement spending averaged per developed home site 
we believe that the presentation of ffo  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  provides a useful measure of our performance 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts also known as nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciable real estate property  net of related income taxes  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo beginning with the nareit definition as further adjusted for the minority interest in the operating partnership owned by persons other than us 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions  since ffo does not consider recurring capital expenditures  debt maturities or other capital expenditure commitments of the company 
we use ffo in measuring our operating performance because we believe that the items that result in a difference between ffo and net income have a different impact to the ongoing operating performance of a real estate company than to other businesses 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity
