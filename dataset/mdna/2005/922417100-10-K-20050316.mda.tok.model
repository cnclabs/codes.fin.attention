item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary veeco designs  manufactures  markets and services a broad line of equipment primarily used by manufacturers in the data storage  semiconductor  wireless and high brightness light emitting diode hb led industries 
veeco s instruments also enable advancements in the growing field of nanoscience and other areas of scientific and industrial research 
our process equipment products precisely deposit or remove etch various materials in the manufacturing of advanced thin film magnetic heads tfmhs for the data storage industry  semiconductor deposition of mask reticles  and wireless telecommunications and hb led devices 
during  the company split out the former process equipment segment into two separate reportable segments 
the first segment  called ion beam and mechanical process equipment combines the etch  deposition and dicing and slicing products sold mostly to data storage customers 
the second segment  called epitaxial process equipment  includes the molecular beam epitaxy mbe and metal organic chemical vapor deposition mocvd products primarily sold to hb led and wireless telecommunications customers 
as such  the company has restated the segment information for prior periods as if the composition of its reportable segments described above had existed in such prior periods 
veeco s metrology equipment is used to provide critical surface measurements on semiconductor devices and tfmhs 
this equipment allows customers to monitor their products throughout the manufacturing process in order to improve yields  reduce costs and improve product quality 
veeco s metrology solutions are also used by many universities  scientific laboratories and industrial applications 
veeco sells its broad line of atomic force microscopes afm  optical interferometers and stylus profilers to thousands of research facilities 
during the past several years  we have strengthened both the metrology and process equipment product lines through strategic acquisitions and through internal product development 
we currently maintain facilities in arizona  california  colorado  minnesota  new jersey and new york  with sales and service locations around the world 
each of our products is currently manufactured in only one location  since we believe that the technological know how and precision needed to make each of our products requires specialized expertise 
highlights of revenue increased to million from million in excluding revenues generated by recently acquired businesses  veeco s revenues increased 
veeco experienced growth in all of our markets  with particular strength in the hb led wireless  data storage and semiconductor industries  orders increased to million from million in veeco s revenues by segment were million from ion beam and mechanical process equipment  million from epitaxial process equipment  and million from metrology  up  and  respectively  from  sales by region were united states  europe  japan and asia pacific 
while veeco experienced growth in all markets in  growth in asia pacific revenues was the strongest  increasing from  despite revenue increases  operating margins did not improve in several business units  loss before income taxes was million compared to million in  net loss of million  including merger and restructuring expenses and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
this compares to a net loss of million in  veeco s cash decreased million during  principally due to the purchase of mti in october while veeco s revenues increased substantially in  the company s profitability declined due to a number of factors 
veeco s disappointing profitability was primarily the result of weak operating margins in several veeco business units 
veeco s gross margin for was compared to in  despite the significant improvement in revenues 
gross margins were particularly weak in our process equipment products  primarily sold to the data storage and hb led wireless markets 
in addition  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in the most serious profitability issue veeco faced during was at its turbodisc business unit 
as more fully described under item business recent events internal accounting investigation  restatement of financial results  veeco discovered improper accounting at our turbodisc business unit in new jersey  which led to an internal investigation and accounting adjustments resulting in the restatement of our financial statements for the first nine months of  including a decrease in our pre tax earnings by million 
the adjustments included in the restatement are summarized in a table set forth in item  financial statements and supplementary data quarterly results of operations 
we have established programs designed to improve turbodisc s profitability by reducing cost of goods through a focus on design efficiencies  better supply chain management  standardization of product offerings  reduced warranty expense and improved pricing policies 
veeco has also taken steps to improve the profitability of our other process equipment business units  including pricing actions  reduction in overhead and employment levels which were part of our fourth quarter restructuring initiatives 
in particular  we are in the process of combining our former aii and mti operations in california into our camarillo facilities and have reduced the headcount and employee cost of such operations 
veeco also reduced operating spending in the metrology business units 
we believe that the steps taken and improvement in product margin mix should help the company to improve profitability 
outlook opportunities our primary strategic objectives are as follows capitalize on the long term growth opportunities in the data storage and wireless and led industries by expanding our process equipment and metrology technology solutions  pursue focused market opportunities in the semiconductor industry in which veeco has specific technology leadership  capitalize on the growth opportunities in scientific research instrumentation  specifically the worldwide investment in nanoscience and nanotechnology on a global basis  invest in internally generated new products through an active research and development program  and also pursue selected strategic acquisitions to further expand the company s breadth of product lines to accommodate the needs of its target customer base  and pursue profitability improvements through design efficiencies  better supply chain management  standardization of product offerings and improved pricing policies 
the several years prior to have been challenging for veeco  its customers and peers due to the prolonged economic downturn and several years of under investment in technology 
at the end of and in the first half of veeco experienced a significant improvement in orders across its research and industrial  semiconductor  data storage and hb led wireless products  driven by increased capital expenditure across these markets  which  combined with recent acquisitions  led to a improvement in veeco s revenues as compared with while capital spending declined in the second half of compared to the first half  fourth quarter orders for veeco recovered up sequentially  led by capital spending by veeco s data storage and semiconductor customers 
although production of hb led s increased throughout the year  capital equipment spending by veeco s wireless led customers weakened at the end of as these customers integrated the significant purchases made by them earlier in into their operations 
overall  worldwide economic conditions appear to have improved compared to consumer spending on many types of electronics has increased and various worldwide economies  such as those in the asia pacific region  are experiencing growth 
the company reviews a number of indicators to predict the strength of our markets going forward 
these include plant utilization trends  capacity requirements and capital spending trends 
technology changes are continuing in all of veeco s markets the continued increase of gb hard drives and investment in gb hard drives in data storage  the increased usage of mini drives in consumer electronic applications  the increased use of veeco s automated afms for sub nanometer semiconductor applications  the opportunity for veeco s mocvd and mbe to further penetrate the emerging wireless and hb led market  and the continued funding of nanoscience research 
veeco expects that its revenues for will be somewhat flat when compared to  given diverging trends and continued caution in spending on capital equipment among customers in its various end markets 
for example  while the company believes that its data storage business will grow in due to customer spending on technology and capacity equipment  this growth will be offset by a decline in its hb led business in compared to s over expansion in capacity by its hb led customers 
with a flat environment on the horizon at least for  veeco s stated focus for the year is to improve the profitability of the company through those actions outlined above 
results of operations years ended december  and the following tables show selected items of veeco s consolidated statements of operations  percentages of sales  and comparisons between and and the analysis of sales and orders for the same periods between our segments  industries and regions in s year ended december  dollar and percentage inc dec year to year net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses selling  general and administrative expense   research and development expense   amortization expense    other income  net  merger  restructuring and other expenses   asset impairment charges write off of purchased in process technology  total operating expenses    operating loss    interest expense   interest income   loss before income taxes    income tax benefit provision before valuation allowance  valuation allowance against deferred tax assets   income tax provision benefit   net loss sales orders year ended december  year ended december  book to bill ratio dollar and percentage inc dec year to year dollar and percentage inc dec year to year segment analysis ion beam and mechanical process equipment   epitaxial process equipment    metrology      total      industry analysis data storage     hb led wireless     semiconductor     research and industrial    total      regional analysis us      europe      japan      asia pacific     total      during the quarter ended september   the company changed the structure of its internal organization in a manner that caused the composition of its reportable segments to change 
the company currently manages  reviews operating results  and assesses performance  as well as allocates resources  based upon this reporting structure 
the change implemented by the company was to split the former process equipment segment into two separate reporting segments 
the new ion beam and mechanical process equipment segment combines the etch  deposition  and dicing and slicing products sold mostly to data storage customers 
the new epitaxial process equipment segment includes the mbe and mocvd products sold to hb led and wireless customers 
the metrology segment remains unchanged 
accordingly  the company has restated segment information for all prior periods presented 
net sales of million for were up from million in in  ion beam and mechanical process equipment sales were up million  or  due to increases of million in etch and deposition equipment  primarily due to the data storage market  and million related to sales from aii products  and also to data storage customers  each as compared to epitaxial process equipment sales were up million in  or  due to million related to sales from turbodisc products  primarily to customers in the hb led industry  partially offset by a million reduction in mbe sales 
the turbodisc and aii product lines were each acquired in the fourth quarter of  and therefore a significant portion of the sales increase is due to twelve months of results in compared to less than a full fiscal quarter in metrology sales increased by to million in from million in we continue to experience a shift in sales from the us to the asia pacific region  which region increased sales by million in compared to  due to the acquired companies and the manufacturing base shifts noted above 
the company believes that there will continue to be period to period variations in the geographic distribution of sales 
orders of million in were a increase as compared to by segment  orders in ion beam and mechanical process equipment increased by due to improved data storage industry conditions resulting from the expanded use of hard drives in consumer electronics 
the improvement in epitaxial process equipment orders was driven by million in orders for turbodisc systems for production of hb led 
this increase was due to the full year impact of turbodisc activities in  as the product line was acquired in the fourth quarter of by industry  data storage increased on higher deposition and etch orders 
semiconductor increased mostly due to a million increase in metrology orders  an million increase in deposition and etch orders  and million of mocvd orders from the turbodisc acquisition partially offset by a million decrease in mbe orders 
hb led wireless orders increased predominantly due to a million increase in mocvd 
regionally  the increase in orders in the u 
s and apac is mostly due to the increase in mocvd orders 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was to during the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  primarily in the data storage and hb led wireless industries 
the company acquired million of backlog as a result of the acquisition of mti in the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to changing business conditions and customer requirements  the company may continue to experience cancellations and or rescheduling of orders 
gross profit for the year ended december   decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in gross profit was million in compared to million in during the year ended december  and december   the company incurred reductions in gross profit related to the acquisitions of turbodisc and aii of million and million  respectively 
the reductions were the result of purchase accounting adjustments due to the required capitalization of profit in inventory and permanent elimination of certain deferred revenue  which is included in cost of sales 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in this decrease was mostly due to a product mix shift from the higher margin metrology segment to the lower margin ion beam and mechanical process equipment and epitaxial process equipment segments  largely due to the acquisitions 
the metrology percentage of total sales declined from in to in the ion beam and mechanical process equipment margins decreased from to 
this reduction was principally due to an unfavorable product mix including lower margins for certain advance development products 
epitaxial process equipment margins declined from in to in the turbodisc margins were negatively impacted by high warranty and material costs 
the metrology gross margin for was  compared with in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in principally due to incremental costs of million attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions  with the balance attributable to higher selling expenses related to the increase in sales  as well as consulting and audit costs related to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
research and development expense totaled million or of sales in compared with million or of sales in this million increase in spending principally resulted from million of incremental costs attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions other income  net  decreased by million primarily due to lower gains realized on the sale of assets held for sale in than in the company incurred merger  restructuring and other expenses of million during comprised of million in severance related to a reduction in employment in the fourth quarter of and million for costs related to the internal investigation of improper accounting transactions at turbodisc 
the million charge for severance related costs include approximately management  administration and manufacturing employees located at the company s plainview  new york and camarillo  california ion beam and mechanical process equipment operations  the somerset  new jersey and st 
paul  minnesota epitaxial process equipment operations  the santa barbara  california and tucson  arizona metrology facilities  the sales and service offices located in france  england and singapore  and the corporate offices in woodbury  new york 
as of december   approximately million has been paid and approximately million remains accrued 
the remainder is expected to be paid by the fourth quarter of as of december   the million investigation costs remained accrued  and are expected to be paid by the second quarter of asset impairment charges of million in related to the consolidation of the aii and mti business and pertained to certain long lived assets of aii that were classified as held for sale as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 these long lived assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the merger  restructuring and other expenses of million in was primarily due to severance costs related to the actions announced in the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
the million write off of purchased in process technology for resulted from the mti acquisition for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate uses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on the projects included 
expenditures to complete mti s projects are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurances can be given that deviations from the estimated completion dates will not occur 
additionally  the projects will require maintenance research and development spending after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
there are risks associated with these projects and there is no assurance that these projects will be technologically feasible or commercially successful 
in  the company wrote off million of purchased in process technology from the turbodisc and aii acquisitions for million and million  respectively 
accordingly  these amounts were expensed at the acquisition dates 
as of december   all of the projects related to these charges have either been completed or cancelled 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on the projects included 
interest income totaled million compared to million in the comparable period 
the change is due to the lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by million in interest income on a federal income tax refund received in the third quarter of income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of loss before income taxes as compared with a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in the difference between the statutory tax benefit and the effective tax rate in was primarily a result of an increase of million in the valuation allowance for its domestic deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details

by segment  ion beam and mechanical process equipment sales were lower due to a decrease of million in etch and deposition products partially offset by million in revenues realized from the aii acquisition 
the decline in etch and deposition sales was partially due to tight capital spending from our data storage customers  as well as read rite corp 
s bankruptcy in read rite accounted for million of sales in  which were not repeated in sales of epitaxial process equipment were up from mostly due to million in revenues realized from the turbodisc acquisition 
a reduction of deposition system sales to telecommunication customers resulted in lower sales to the hb led wireless industry 
sales reductions of million in mbe  million of etch and deposition and million in optical metrology  partially offset by increases of million in other products  resulted in the decrease of sales to the research and industrial market 
by region  there was a shift in sales from the us to the asia pacific region 
asia pacific sales increased due to a general pickup in business across the region  including an increase in afm sales of million 
million of the sales increase in the asia pacific region was attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
the company believes that there will continue to be year to year variations in the geographic content of sales 
orders of million in were a increase over orders of million in orders in ion beam and mechanical process equipment increased by due to improved conditions across the historical product lines 
the improvement in epitaxial process equipment orders was driven by million in orders for turbodisc systems  partially offset by a million reduction in mbe orders 
by industry  the largest increase was a increase in hb led wireless  primarily due to million in orders received for turbodisc products 
data storage increased on higher deposition and etch orders 
research and industrial was down mostly due to a million decline in mbe orders 
semiconductor was down due to a million reduction in deposition and etch equipment orders  primarily due to the lithography market  offset by improvements across other product lines 
regionally  the decline in orders in the us is mostly due to a shift to overseas production  primarily in the data storage industry 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was to during the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  primarily in the data storage and hb led wireless industries 
the company acquired million of backlog from companies acquired in the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to changing business conditions and customer requirements  the company may continue to experience cancellations and or rescheduling of orders 
gross profit for the year ended december   increased to million  or from million  or in during the year ended december   the company incurred a million reduction in gross profit related to the acquisitions of turbodisc and aii 
the reduction was the result of purchase accounting adjustments due to the required capitalization of profit in inventory and permanent elimination of certain deferred revenue  which is included in cost of sales 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  of which million  or of net sales  related to the write off of inventory in  which were included in the cost of sales 
excluding the impact of the purchase accounting adjustment in and the merger and restructuring charge in  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to from 
the increased gross margin is mostly due to a improvement in the ion beam and mechanical process equipment gross margin  primarily due to the cost savings associated with plant and personnel consolidations initiated in selling  general and administrative expenses were down million or  to million in from million in  principally due to a million decrease in selling expense  resulting from reduced personnel  occupancy and advertising spending  as well as a million decrease in administration costs  resulting from realized cost efficiencies 
such decreases were partially offset by incremental costs of million attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
research and development expense totaled million or of sales in compared with million or of sales in this million decrease in spending resulted from efficiencies achieved through the site consolidations in the process equipment segment in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by million of incremental costs attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
other income  net  increased by million primarily due to gains realized on the sale of assets held for sale 
merger and restructuring costs of million in  principally resulted from severance and business relocation expenses related to the cost reduction programs announced and initiated in the fourth quarter of these included the transfer of our sunnyvale afm business to santa barbara as well as severance costs incurred in the process equipment segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
the million write off of purchased in process technology for resulted from the turbodisc and aii acquisitions for million and million  respectively  related to projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate uses

additionally  the projects will require maintenance research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
there are risks associated with these projects  and there is no assurance that these projects will be technologically or commercially successful 
interest income totaled million in compared to million in the comparable period 
the decrease is due to a reduction in interest income on short term investments as a result of lower interest rates plus lower cash balances due to the million cash outlay for acquired companies 
income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes as compared with a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in the lower tax rate in is due to million of non deductible charges taken in from the write down of goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources veeco s primary source of funds at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
this amount represents a decrease of million from the december  balance of million 
a contributor to this decrease was the million in payments for the net assets acquired in connection with the mti acquisition 
if this item is excluded  the company generated million in cash in the company s primary future cash commitment is in  when the million of convertible subordinated notes mature 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share and are redeemable by veeco under certain circumstances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
cash provided by operations totaled million during the year ended december  of the cash generated  million was derived from adjusting the net loss of million for non cash charges of million  including million in depreciation and amortization expense and million for provision for deferred income taxes 
the provision for deferred income taxes included a million valuation allowance that was provided in the fourth quarter of because the company determined that the benefit of its domestic net deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the balance of million is from changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  including cash used for increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  partially offset by a cash generation for increases in accounts payable of million and accrued expenses  deferred profit and other current assets and liabilities  net  of million 
accounts receivable increased primarily as a result of higher sales volume 
inventories increased as a result of a ramp up in orders at the company s epitaxial process equipment segment  as well as shipment delays in the metrology and epitaxial process equipment segments and the build up of raw materials and work in process for products to be shipped in the first quarter of the increase in accounts payable was principally the result of increased inventory levels  and the increase in accrued expenses  deferred profit and other current assets and liabilities  net  primarily due to an increase in warranty and installation obligations as a direct result of the increase in sales volume  as well as the timing of the payroll related payments 
cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  is a result of the million in payments for the business acquired  as noted above  plus million for the payment to the former shareholders of nanodevices related to the achievement of certain production targets plus capital expenditures of million 
partially offsetting these cash uses were proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale of million and net maturities of long term investments of million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
the generation of cash from financing activities in primarily resulted from stock issuances 
on december   the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes  and on january   the company issued an additional million of notes pursuant to an over allotment option 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on december  in connection with this offering  the company purchased approximately million of us government securities  which were pledged to the trustee under the indenture governing the notes  as security for the exclusive benefit of the holders of the notes 
these securities were sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments due on the notes 
there were no pledged securities remaining as of december  the notes are subordinated in right of payment to substantially all other indebtedness of the company 
the notes are repayable upon certain change of control events and upon the acceleration of certain other indebtedness for money borrowed of the company 
after december  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture relating to the notes 
on march   the company entered into a revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings of up to million the facility 
the facility s annual interest rate is a floating rate equal to the prime rate of the agent bank plus and is adjustable to a minimum rate equal to the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flow is below a defined amount 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
the facility has a term of three years and borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other requirements  impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  the payment of dividends  long term leases  investments  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company will be required to satisfy certain financial tests under the facility and substantially all of the assets of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries  other than real estate  have been pledged to secure the company s obligations under the facility 
as of march   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
on march   the company terminated its previous million revolving credit facility which had been established on april  the old facility 
for all periods during and  no borrowings were outstanding under the old facility 
as of december   the company was contingently liable for a letter of credit in the amount of million issued under the old facility 
this letter of credit was terminated in connection with the termination of the old facility 
at december   veeco s contractual cash obligations and commitments are as follows in thousands contractual cash obligations and commitments total less than year years years more than years long term debt    interest on debt      operating leases      earn out features on acquisitions   letters of credit   purchase commitments the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the company s million facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements for the next twelve months  as well as the company s contractual obligations  detailed in the above table  over the next three years 
the company believes it will be able to meet its obligation to repay the million subordinated notes that mature on december  through a combination of conversion of the notes outstanding  refinancing  cash generated from operations  and or other means 
the company is potentially liable for payment of earn out features to the former owners of the businesses acquired in based on operating targets achieved by the acquired businesses 
the maximum amount of these contingent liabilities is million consisting of million to the former shareholders of aii  million to the former shareholders of nanodevices  inc and million to emcore  the former owner of turbodisc 
earn out amounts would be paid to the former shareholders of nanodevices  inc  during each of the first quarters of  and  if revenue targets are reached during the preceding year up to the maximum payment 
earn out amounts would be paid during each of the first quarters of  and to the former owners of aii  and during each of the first quarters of and to emcore  if revenue targets are met 
payments to the former shareholders of aii and to emcore are based on a set percentage of revenues in excess of certain targets for the preceding fiscal year 
the company paid million of the amount potentially payable to the former shareholders of nanodevices  inc  during the third quarter of pertaining to a one time production payout and expects to pay the former shareholders of nanodevices  inc approximately million during the first quarter of pertaining to the revenue based earn out 
additionally  the company expects to pay approximately million to emcore during the first half of except as noted herein  the company does not have an estimate of how much  or when  amounts may be due to the former owners of aii  nanodevices or emcore for each fiscal year 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
on december  and  the company entered into forward contracts for the month of january for the notional amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  which approximated the respective fair market value at december  and application of critical accounting policies general veeco s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon veeco s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires veeco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring costs and contingent litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  warranty costs  the impairment of long lived assets and the accounting for deferred taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which superseded the earlier related guidance in sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
a multiple element arrangement is a transaction which may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  and performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products produced according to the company s published specifications  where no installation is required or installation is deemed perfunctory and no substantive customer acceptance provisions exist  revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product has been tested and it has been demonstrated that it meets the customer s specifications and title passes to the customer 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention generally to  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the equipment since installation does not involve significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment or building complex interfaces and connections 
in addition  the equipment could be installed by the customer or other vendors and generally the cost of installation approximates only to of the sales value of the related equipment 
for new products  new applications of existing products  or for products with substantive customer acceptance provisions where performance cannot be fully assessed prior to meeting customer specifications at the customer site  revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of final customer acceptance 
since title to goods generally passes to the customer upon shipment and to of the contract amount becomes payable at that time  inventory is relieved and accounts receivable is recorded for the amount billed at the time of shipment 
the profit on the amount billed for these transactions is deferred and recorded as deferred profit in the accompanying balance sheets 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  are recorded in deferred profit 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue  which is included in other accrued expenses  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out method or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage for the next to month s requirements is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to veeco s future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if it is determined that impairment indicators are present and that the assets will not be fully recoverable  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these assumptions  and thus veeco may be required to record impairment charges for those assets not previously recorded 
the company completed the first of the required impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the first quarter of based upon the judgment of management  it was determined that there was no impairment to goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives as of january  during the fourth quarter of  management determined that due to the continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and the uncertainty of the timing and speed of recovery  impairment indicators were present 
under sfas no 
 if impairment indicators are present  the fair value of the reporting unit must be determined 
based upon the judgment of management  goodwill arising from the september applied epi acquisition which is included in the epitaxial process equipment reporting unit  was deemed significantly impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million and has written down goodwill related to the epitaxial process equipment reporting unit to approximately million as of december  during the fourth quarter of and  as required  the company performed an annual impairment test  and based upon the judgment of management  it was determined that no impairment exists 
long lived asset impairment the carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment indicators are present 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining depreciation period  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
during  million in fixed asset impairment charges were recorded by the company related to the consolidation of the aii and mti business 
during there were no indicators of impairment present 
the company recorded million of fixed asset impairment charges in assumptions utilized by management in reviewing for impairment of long lived assets could be effected by changes in strategy and or market conditions which may require veeco to record additional impairment charges for these assets  as well as impairment charges on other long lived assets not previously recorded 
warranty costs the company estimates the costs that may be incurred under the warranty it provides and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as the company s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance as part of the process of preparing veeco s consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which the future tax benefits will be recognized on a more likely than not basis 
our net deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and timing differences between the book and tax treatment of inventory and other asset valuations 
realization of these net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
we record valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  we consider a variety of factors  including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
under sfas no 
 factors such as current and previous operating losses are given significantly greater weight than the outlook for future profitability in determining the deferred tax asset carrying value 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a charge of approximately million to establish a valuation allowance against the balance of its domestic net deferred tax assets  which consist of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as temporary deductible differences 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which places primary importance on the company s historical results of operations 
although the company s results in prior years were significantly affected by restructuring and other charges  the company s historical losses and losses incurred in the current fiscal year represented negative evidence sufficient to require a full valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas no 
if the company is able to realize part or all of the deferred tax assets in future periods  it will reduce its provision for income taxes with a release of the valuation allowance in an amount that corresponds with the income tax liability generated 
other recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement no 
however  statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt statement no 
r on july  statement no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company has not yet determined whether it will adopt statement no 
r using the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
as permitted by statement no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on consolidated results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall consolidated financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per common share in note to veeco s consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce consolidated net operating cash flows and increase consolidated net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of consolidated operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million and million in and  respectively 
risk factors that may impact future results in addition to the other information set forth herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered by shareholders of and potential investors in the company 
the cyclicality of the microelectronics industries we serve directly affects our business 
veeco s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage  hb led wireless and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as research and industrial customers  which accounted for the following percentages of our net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  data storage hb led wireless semiconductor scientific research and industrial veeco is subject to the business cycles of these industries  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
these industries have historically been highly cyclical and have experienced significant economic downturns in the last decade 
as a capital equipment provider  our revenues depend in large part on the spending patterns of these customers  who often delay expenditures or cancel or reschedule orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions 
in downturns  we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions  as well as motivate and retain key employees 
however  because a high proportion of our costs are fixed  our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls is limited 
a downturn in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to acquire and or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand  and attract  hire  assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people 
we cannot give assurances that our net sales and operating results will not be adversely affected if our customers experience economic downturns or slowdowns in their businesses 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change 
the data storage  hb led wireless  semiconductor and scientific research and industrial industries are subject to rapid technological change 
our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products in a timely and cost effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  we must anticipate the future demand for products in selecting which development programs to fund and pursue 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
many of our competitors have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
in addition  we face competition from smaller emerging equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services we offer  using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets 
new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins 
our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 
in addition  a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  if a customer selects a competitor s product over ours for technical superiority or other reasons  we could experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time 
we depend on a limited number of customers that operate in highly concentrated industries 
our customer base is and has been highly concentrated 
orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for  and likely will continue to account for  a substantial portion of our net sales  which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to us 
based on net sales  seagate technology  inc is our largest customer  with  and of total net sales in  and  respectively our only customer with sales greater than in any of the past three years 
if a principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
in addition  because a relatively small number of large manufacturers  many of whom are our customers  dominate the industries in which they operate  it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
a substantial portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers 
furthermore  we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales and we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each new order we attempt to obtain 
our failure to obtain new sales orders from new or existing customers  would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue 
factors which affect our quarterly results  in addition to the other risk factors described herein  include the timing of significant orders  shipments and customer acceptance of our products  rescheduling or cancellations of customer orders  difficulties in manufacturing or meeting technical specifications  changes in product mix and the cost of materials  and our acquisitions and financings 
we derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period 
as is typical in our industry  orders  shipments and customer acceptances often occur during the last few weeks of a quarter 
as a result  delay of only a week or two can often shift the related booking or net sales into the next quarter  which could adversely affect our reported results for the prior quarter 
in addition  customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  generally with limited or no penalties 
in limited circumstances  we have permitted major customers to return previously shipped products in order to maintain business relationships with such customers 
backlog adjustments for the year ended december  of million included order cancellations of million 
historically  we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles such as the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer 
our sales cycle can range up to twelve months 
the timing of an order often depends on the capital expenditure budget cycle of our customers  which is completely out of our control 
in addition  the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications the build cycle typically ranges from one to six months  followed in certain cases by a period of customer acceptance during which the customer evaluates the performance of the system and may potentially reject the system 
as a result of the build cycle and evaluation periods  the period between a customer s initial purchase decision and revenue recognition on an order often varies widely  and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in our operating results 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if our orders  shipments  net sales or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  our stock price may be adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks associated with evaluating and pursuing these opportunities and integrating these businesses 
we have considered numerous acquisition opportunities and completed several significant acquisitions in the past 
we may consider acquisitions of  or investments in  other businesses in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in integrating the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention while evaluating  pursuing and integrating the business to be acquired  potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  especially if a relocation or change in responsibilities is involved  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations in a cost effective manner  lack of synergy or inability to realize expected synergies  and possible write down of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition  the ownership percentage of our then existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by these shareholders could be diluted  which could adversely affect the price of our stock and convertible subordinated notes 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition  the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or other purposes  including making payments on the convertible subordinated notes 
there can be no assurance that financing for future acquisitions will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our inability to attract  retain and motivate key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees  including those in managerial  engineering  marketing and other roles 
our growth is dependent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  in addition to personnel that can implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems 
attracting  retaining and motivating qualified personnel may be difficult due to challenging industry conditions  competition for such personnel by other technology companies  consolidations and relocations of operations and workforce reductions 
our inability to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
approximately of our net sales and of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states 
we expect sales from non us markets to continue to represent a significant  and possibly increasing  portion of our sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings  difficulties in obtaining us export licenses in connection with sales of products to customers in certain geographic regions  including china and asia pacific  a particular disadvantage relative to our non us competitors who are not required to comply with us export controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  periodic regional economic downturns and unstable political environments  longer sales cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  including import export controls and other trade barriers 
many of these challenges are present in china  a large potential market for the company s products and an area that we anticipate will present a significant opportunity for growth 
instability in china and other foreign economies may continue and recur again in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  political instability  terrorism  acts of war or epidemics in regions where we operate may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales  sales commitments and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  these hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could materially and adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
we also are exposed to interest rate risks inherent in our debt obligations and investment portfolios 
our success depends on protection of our intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by others 
our success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights 
we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to certain of our products and technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive  and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
in addition  our intellectual property rights may be circumvented  invalidated or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change 
furthermore  the laws of other countries may less effectively protect our proprietary rights  compared to us laws 
infringement of our rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities 
from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent or other rights which they believe cover certain of our products 
we also periodically receive notice from customers who believe that we are required to indemnify them for damages they may incur related to infringement claims made against these customers by third parties 
our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider the available alternatives  including whether to seek a license  if appropriate 
however  we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or  if obtained  will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend our position  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
on september   we commenced a lawsuit against asylum research inc  a privately held company founded by former veeco employees 
the suit alleges infringement of five patents relating to our afm technologies 
we are seeking monetary damages and a permanent injunction to stop infringement 
asylum has asserted that the patents we are suing on are invalid and unenforceable and has filed a counterclaim for infringement of a patent licensed by asylum and payment of royalties it believes it is owed 
cross motions for summary judgment related to the issues of infringement and or validity of the patents in suit are pending 
the court has held hearings on the summary judgment motions and has referred many of the issues to a special master 
we believe asylum s claims are without merit 
nonetheless  the costs of pursuing this matter are significant and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this matter 
we face securities class action lawsuits and a derivative demand letter which could result in substantial costs  diversion of management s attention and resources and negative publicity 
the company  its chairman and chief executive officer  and its executive vice president and chief financial officer were named as defendants in putative class action shareholder lawsuits filed in federal court in new york asserting claims for violation of federal securities laws on behalf of persons who acquired the company s securities during the periods beginning november  or april  and ending february  the lawsuits  which are substantially similar  seek unspecified damages and allege claims against all defendants for violations of section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and claims against the individual defendants for violations of section b of the exchange act 
although the company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against the claims  the lawsuits could result in substantial costs  divert management s attention and resources from our operations and negatively affect our public image and reputation 
in addition  the company has received a letter on behalf of a shareholder of the company demanding that the company commence legal action against its directors and certain of its officers for breaches of fiduciary duties 
an unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation in these matters could materially harm the company s business 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers 
failure of the suppliers of critical parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely and cost effective manner could adversely affect our business 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply or pricing arrangements with our suppliers 
as a result  we risk increased cost of materials and difficulty in procuring the parts we need to fill customer orders 
we currently use numerous suppliers  however  some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
failure of any of these suppliers to perform in a timely or quality manner could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
we may not obtain sufficient affordable funds to finance our future needs 
we may need to make significant capital expenditures to continue our operations and to enhance our manufacturing capability to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies 
also  our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers 
as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase in the future 
during the past few years  the markets for equity and debt securities have fluctuated significantly  especially with respect to technology related companies  and during some periods offerings of those securities have been extremely difficult to complete 
as a result  in the future we may not be able to obtain the additional funds required to fund our operations and invest sufficiently in research and development on reasonable terms  or at all 
such a lack of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are subject to risks of non compliance with environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with our business operations  including but not limited to regulations related to the development  manufacture and use of our products 
failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacture or use of certain of our products  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have adopted certain measures that may have anti takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
these measures include blank check preferred stock  classified board of directors  shareholder rights plan or poison pill  and certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock 
as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
our board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three year term 
the existence of a classified board will make it more difficult for the shareholders to change the composition and therefore the policies of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  under which we have granted to our shareholders rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock 
these rights could discourage a takeover that is not approved by our board of directors but which a shareholder might consider in its best interest  thereby adversely affecting our stock price 
we have adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions which may have anti takeover effects 
these include a requiring certain actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent  b requiring a super majority of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders or to approve certain amendments to our bylaws  c limiting the maximum number of directors  and d providing that directors may be removed only for cause 
these measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination  including mergers and asset sales  with an interested stockholder generally  a or greater stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the operation of section may have anti takeover effects  which could delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks such as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are rates on debt and short term and long term investment portfolios  and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates veeco centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
veeco s investment portfolios at december  consist of cash equivalents 
at december  in addition to cash equivalents the investment portfolio also included obligations of us government agencies 
these investments in obligations of the us government are considered held to maturity securities 
accordingly  the amounts are carried at amortized cost 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
in december and january  the company issued an aggregate of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
interest payments commenced on june  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the notes will mature on december  the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
veeco s net sales to foreign customers represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company expects that net sales to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of veeco s total net sales 
veeco s net sales denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of total net sales in  in and in the aggregate foreign currency exchange losses gains included in determining consolidated results of operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in the aggregate foreign currency exchange losses gains were gains losses relating to forward contracts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts were recorded and included in other income  net 
as of december   approximately million of losses related to forward contracts were included in accrued expenses and subsequently paid in january on december   the company entered into forward contracts for the month of january for the notional amount of million  which approximated the market value at december  veeco is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  veeco uses derivative financial instruments 
veeco does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company enters into monthly forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known currency exposures 
the average notional amount of such contracts outstanding was approximately million for the year ended december  the changes in currency exchange rates that have the largest impact on translating veeco s international operating loss profit are the japanese yen and the euro 
the company believes that based upon its hedging program  a change in foreign exchange rates would have an immaterial impact on the consolidated results of operations 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies
