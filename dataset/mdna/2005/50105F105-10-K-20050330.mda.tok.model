item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company also provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no such impairment indicators  as defined  were present 
o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  during the company concluded that the more likely than not recognition criteria had been met with respect to the income tax benefit associated with its german net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
o the company records accruals for legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income from operations are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
in addition  other income and expense items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
executive summary the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
net income in includes i a second quarter income tax benefit related to the reversal of kronos deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in germany of per diluted share and ii income related to kronos contract dispute settlement of million  or 
per diluted share 
net income in includes an income tax benefit relating to the refund of prior year german income taxes of

net income in includes i an income tax benefit related to the reduction in the belgian corporate income tax rate of 
per diluted share and ii income of 
per diluted share related to kronos foreign currency transaction gain resulting from the extinguishment of certain intercompany indebtedness of nl and kronos 
each of these items is more fully discussed below and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently expect income from operations will be higher in compared to  but this increase will not offset the decline in income tax benefits in as compared to relative changes in the company s tio sales and operating income during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices and iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates

excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies were lower in as compared to when translated from billing currencies into us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased as compared to see effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased compared to  as higher volumes in european and export markets more than offset lower volumes in canada 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
demand for tio has remained strong throughout  and while kronos believes that the strong demand is largely attributable to the end use demand of its customers  it is possible that some portion of the strong demand resulted from customers increasing their inventory levels of tio in advance of implementation of announced or anticipated price increases 
kronos operating income comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher production levels  which increased 
kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods  and kronos sales and production volumes in were both new records for kronos  setting new volume records for kronos for the third consecutive year 
the company s cost of sales increased million in compared to due to higher raw material and maintenance costs as well as higher production volumes and related effects of translating foreign currencies into the us dollar 
the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in due primarily to the effects of lower average selling prices and higher costs 
the company s gross margins decreased million from to due to the net effects of the aforementioned changes in sales and cost of sales during such periods 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent from to  increasing marginally from to  and increasing proportionately with the increased sales and production volume 
kronos income from operations in includes million of income related to the settlement of a contract dispute with a customer 
as part of the settlement  the customer agreed to make payments to kronos through aggregating million 
the million gain recognized represents the present value of the future payments to be made by the customer to kronos 
the dispute with the customer concerned the customer s alleged past failure to purchase the required amount of tio from kronos under the terms of kronos contract with the customer 
under the settlement  the customer agreed to pay an aggregate of million to kronos through to resolve such dispute 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos income from operations decreased million in as compared to  as the effect of lower average tio selling prices and higher raw material and maintenance costs more than offset the impact of higher sales and production volumes and the income from the contract dispute settlement

year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s sales increased million in compared to due primarily to higher average selling prices  higher sales volumes and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased sales by approximately million as further discussed below 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  the company s average tio selling price in was higher than  with the greatest improvement in european and export markets 
when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  the company s average tio selling prices in increased compared to see effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
the company s tio sales volumes in increased from  with higher volumes in european and north american markets more than offsetting a decline in volumes to export markets 
the company s cost of sales increased million in compared to due to the higher sales volumes 
the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in due primarily to the effects of continued cost reduction efforts combined with the impact of higher production volumes and higher average selling prices 
operating rates were near full capacity during most of  setting a new company production record 
the company s gross margins increased million from to due to the net effects of the aforementioned changes in sales and cost of sales during such periods 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses remained consistent at  increasing proportionately with the increased sales and production volume 
corporate expenses for increased to million as compared to primarily due to higher fees associated with kronos becoming a separate sec registrant and certain corporate office relocation expenses 
kronos income from operations increased million in compared to due primarily to higher average tio selling prices and higher tio sales and production volumes 
see also effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates kronos sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap gaap measure 
kronos discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because kronos believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
the difference between the and increases in kronos average tio selling prices during and  respectively  as compared to the respective prior year using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  and the increase and decrease in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure during such periods is due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the above table presents i the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  ii the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure and iii the percentage change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the reconciling item between the non gaap measure and the gaap measure 
kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales by a net million in as compared to  and increased sales by a net million in as compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
kronos operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in and compared to the same periods of the respective prior years 
overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net million increase in kronos operating income in as compared to  and resulted in a net decrease in kronos operating income in of approximately million as compared to outlook reflecting the impact of partial implementation of prior price increase announcements  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in the fourth quarter of were higher than the third quarter of in  kronos expects income from operations will be higher than  primarily due to higher expected selling prices in the anticipated higher selling prices in reflects the expected continued implementation of price increase announcements  including kronos latest price increases announced in march the extent to which any of such price increases which have previously been announced  and any additional price increases which may be announced subsequently in  will be realized will depend on  among other things  economic factors 
kronos efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
kronos production capacity has increased by approximately over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs  with only moderate capital investment 
kronos believes its annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  with some slight additional capacity available in through kronos continued debottlenecking efforts 
kronos expects its tio production volumes in will be slightly higher than its volumes  with sales volumes comparable to or slightly lower in as compared to kronos average tio selling prices  which started to increase during the second half of  are expected to continue to increase during  and consequently kronos currently expects its average tio selling prices  in billing currencies  will be higher in as compared to overall  kronos expects its income from operations in will be higher than  due primarily to higher expected selling prices 
kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
other income expense 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding other income and expense items 
years ended december  change in millions in millions currency transaction gains interest income from affiliates 

trade interest income 

other interest income 



interest expense to affiliates other interest expense interest income fluctuates in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
aggregate interest income increased approximately  in compared to due to higher average yields on invested funds 
as compared to  aggregate interest income in declined million primarily due to lower amounts outstanding on loans to affiliates 
the company expects interest income will be lower in than due to lower average funds available for investment 
the company has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in the euro  including kii s euro denominated senior secured notes senior secured notes 
accordingly  the reported amount of interest expense will vary depending on relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest expense on indebtedness to third parties in was higher than due primarily to relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased the us dollar equivalent of interest expense on the euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes outstanding during both years by approximately million as compared to the respective prior year 
in addition  kii issued an additional euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes in november  and the interest expense associated with these additional senior secured notes was million in interest expense to affiliates increased million in as compared to due to higher amounts outstanding on loans from affiliates  primarily due to the million dividend distributed to nl in december such note was repaid in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not currently expect to report any material interest expense to affiliates in assuming interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not increase significantly from current levels  interest expense on third party indebtedness in is expected to be higher than due primarily to the effect of the issuance of an additional euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes in november aggregate interest expense increased million in as compared to due primarily to the net effects of higher average levels of indebtedness and lower average interest rates on the company s indebtedness 
at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally kii s senior secured notes  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average interest rate of  million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was none outstanding  million outstanding at

as noted above  kii has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
at december   kronos had the equivalent of million and million of income tax loss carryforwards for german corporate and trade tax purposes  respectively  all of which have no expiration date 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  kronos had previously provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of these tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany because kronos did not believe they met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
during the first six months of  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of these german net operating loss carryforwards  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized 
at june   after considering all available evidence  kronos concluded that these german tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences now met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
under applicable gaap related to accounting for income taxes at interim periods  a change in estimate at an interim period resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance is segregated into two components  the portion related to the remaining interim periods of the current year and the portion related to all future years 
the portion of the valuation allowance reversal related to the former is recognized over the remaining interim periods of the current year  and the portion of the valuation allowance related to the latter is recognized at the time the change in estimate is made 
accordingly  as of june   kronos reversed million of the valuation allowance the portion related to future years  and kronos reversed the remaining million during the last six months of because the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany has now been recognized  the company s effective income tax rate in is expected to be higher than what it would have otherwise been  although its future cash income tax rate will not be affected by the reversal of the valuation allowance 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards effective january  to of taxable income after the first euro million of taxable income 
the new law will have a significant effect on kronos cash tax payments in germany going forward  the extent of which will be dependent upon the level of taxable income earned in germany 
during  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  kronos recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
during  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
the provision for income taxes in also includes a million deferred income tax benefit related to certain changes in the belgian tax law 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted into law 
the new law contains several provisions that could impact the company 
these provisions provide for  among other things  a special deduction from us taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic activities as defined beginning in  and a special dividends received deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
both of these provisions are complex and subject to numerous limitations

defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by the company to all of its plans aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligation related to company plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  and december  and december  and expense in expense in expense in germany norway canada us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to the company s plans in the germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o in germany  the composition of the company s plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to real estate 
o in norway  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately and to and  respectively 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
o in canada  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o during  the plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  through december  the average annual rate of return has been approximately 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company s assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany norway canada us the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and the company s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if the company lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  the company s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb income of approximately  in   in and consolidated opeb cost of approximately  in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in each of  and substantially all of the company s accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
as a result  the amount recognized for opeb expense for financial reporting purposes has been  and is expected to continue to be  significantly less than the amount of opeb benefit payments made each year 
accordingly  the amount of accrued opeb expense has been  and is expected to continue to  decline gradually 
the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and the company s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate  in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately  of contributions to such plans during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately  at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in liquidity and capital resources summary the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flows from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
in addition  from time to time the company will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
also  the company may from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to i repay existing indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold  ii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iii pay dividends 
at december   the company s indebtedness was substantially comprised of million related to kii s senior secured notes due in and the equivalent of million related to kii s euro million secured revolving credit facility european credit facility due in june accordingly  the company does not currently expect that a significant amount of its cash flows from operating activities generated during will be required to be used to repay indebtedness during kii expects to seek a renewal of its european credit facility during the first half of consolidated cash flows the company s consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below years ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided used by operating  investing and financing activities operating cash flows 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
however  certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation and amortization expense  non cash interest expense 
non cash interest expense relates to amortization of original issue discount or premium on certain indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
changes in product pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  can significantly affect the liquidity of the company 
relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period from when the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivable 
relative changes in inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities are affected by  among other things  the timing of raw material purchases and the payment for such purchases and the relative difference between production volumes and sales volumes 
cash flows provided from operating activities increased from million in to million in this million increase was due primarily to the net effect of i higher net income of million  ii a larger deferred income tax benefit of million  iii higher depreciation and amortization expense of million  iv higher net distributions from kronos tio manufacturing joint venture of million  v a higher amount of net cash used to fund changes in the company s inventories  receivables  payables  accruals and accounts with affiliates of million and vi higher cash received for income taxes of million 
cash flows from operating activities decreased from million in to million in this million decrease was due primarily to the effect of i higher net income of million  ii higher depreciation expense of million  iii lower net distributions from the tio manufacturing joint venture of  in compared to million in  iv a lower amount of net cash generated from relative changes in the company s inventories  receivables  payables and accruals and accounts with affiliates of million in as compared to and v lower cash paid for income taxes of million 
relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivable

cash flows related to capital contributions and other transactions with affiliates aggregated net cash outflows of million in and a net cash inflow of million in such amounts related principally to loans that kronos made to affiliates such notes receivable from affiliates being reported as reductions to kronos stockholders equity  and therefore considered financing cash flows 
additionally  settlement of the above mentioned notes receivable from affiliates was not then currently contemplated in the foreseeable future 
in  kronos transferred certain of such notes receivable from affiliates to nl  and as a result  kronos will no longer report cash flows related to certain of such notes receivable from affiliates 
such net cash flows in also included million related to the company s purchase of ewi re  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
provisions contained in certain of kronos credit agreements could result in the acceleration of the applicable indebtedness prior to its stated maturity 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
other than operating lease commitments disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is not party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements

kronos contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock contain fixed quantities that kronos is required to purchase  although certain of these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased  generally no more than  based on the company s feedstock requirements 
the pricing under these agreements is generally based on a fixed price with price escalation clauses primarily based on consumer price indices  as defined in the respective contracts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into currency forward contracts  interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than as described below  the company was not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of the company s aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  at december  and  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars or the euro and the outstanding variable rate borrowings were denominated in euros 
information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using exchange rates of us dollars per euro 
certain norwegian kroner denominated capital leases totaling  in have been excluded from the table below 
amount carrying fair interest maturity indebtedness value value rate date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated kii senior secured notes variable rate indebtedness euro denominated european credit facility at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of 
all of such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in euros 
variable indebtedness at december  was nil 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   the company had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
at december   the company had entered into a short term currency forward contract maturing on january  to exchange an aggregate of euro million into us dollars at an exchange rate of us per euro 
such contract was entered into in conjunction with the january payment of an intercompany dividend from one of the company s european subsidiaries 
at december   the actual exchange rate was us per euro 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contract was not material at december  other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses 
non gaap financial measures 
in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results as determined by gaap  kronos has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors 
as discussed above  the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
such disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling price in billing currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in the company s average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable gaap measure 
the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods
