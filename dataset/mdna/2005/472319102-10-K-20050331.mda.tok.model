item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include statements about our future and statements that are not historical facts 
these forward looking statements are usually preceded by the words believe  intend  may  will  or similar expressions 
forward looking statements may contain expectations regarding revenues  earnings  operations and other financial projections  and may include statements of future performance  plans and objectives 
forward looking statements also include statements pertaining to our strategies for future development of our business and products 
forward looking statements represent only our belief regarding future events  many of which by their nature are inherently uncertain and outside of our control 
it is possible that the actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the anticipated results indicated in these forward looking statements 
information regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ  perhaps materially  from those in our forward looking statements is contained in this report and other documents we file 
you should read and interpret any forward looking statement together with these documents  including the following the risk factors contained in this report under the caption factors affecting our business  the discussion of our analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report  and cautionary statements we make in our public documents  reports and announcements 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made 
we will not update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results will inevitably differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
management believes its critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are its valuation methodologies applied to investments and to securities positions 
investments are stated at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by management 
generally  we initially value these investments at cost and require that changes in value be established by meaningful third party transactions or a significant change in the financial condition or operating performance of the issuer  unless meaningful developments occur that otherwise warrant a change in the valuation of an investment 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  reported net asset values  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 

table of contents furthermore  judgment is used to value certain securities eg  swaps  private securities  a securities  less liquid securities  if quoted market prices are not available 
these valuations are made with consideration for various assumptions  including time value  yield curve  volatility factors  liquidity  market prices on comparable securities and other factors 
the subjectivity involved in this process makes these valuations inherently less reliable than quoted market prices 
we believe that our comprehensive risk management policies and procedures serve to monitor the appropriateness of the assumptions used 
the use of different assumptions  however  could produce materially different estimates of fair value

we consider these ratios as meaningful measurements of our financial condition and believe they provide investors with additional metrics to comparatively assess the fair market value of our stock 
revenues by source our earnings are subject to wide fluctuations since many factors over which we have little or no control  particularly the overall volume of trading and the volatility and general level of market prices  may significantly affect our operations 
the following provides a summary of revenues by source for the past three years 
year ended december  of of of total total total amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues dollars in thousands commissions and principal transactions equities international high yield convertible execution bonds direct other proprietary trading total investment banking asset management fees and investment income from managed funds asset management fees investment income from managed funds total interest other total revenues compared to overview revenues  net of interest expense  increased million  or  to  million  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an million  or  increase in investment banking  a million  or  increase in trading revenues commissions and principal transactions  and a million  or  increase in asset management fees and investment income from managed funds 
table of contents partially offset by a million decrease in net interest revenues interest income less interest expense over last year 
our overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the diversification of our platform 
while the equity markets were strong for most of fiscal  we also achieved record revenues and earnings as a result of new product offerings  acquisitions of strategic investment banking businesses  strategic hirings and operational improvements 
there were several factors which depressed investor activity during the anticipation of rising interest rates dampened the demand for fixed income products  and the federal reserve commenced a series of rate hikes during the year 
the demanding regulatory environment remained in the spotlight and focused on the financial services industry  resulting in an increase in the cost of compliance and an impact on public trust and confidence 
finally  there was uncertainty over the presidential election  the war in iraq and the various economic policies that might be endorsed 
equity revenue equity revenue is composed of commissions and principal transaction trading revenues  net of soft dollar expenses 
despite downturns in industry block trading volumes  which were down for the nyse trading and down nearly in nasdaq trading on a year over year basis  equity revenue for was million  up over last year 
equity revenue increased for the following reasons i we engaged in several large block trading opportunities generated from investment banking relationships that are not necessarily repeatable and ii we experienced continued growth in strategic efforts  including sector trading  private client services  and equity research sales 
international revenue international revenue of million was down slightly from last year 
international revenue decreased due to weaker market conditions 
lower volumes in adr and us based european equity trading were offset by gains in asset management in both london and zurich and secondary trading volume in japanese equities 
secondary convertible trading was flat for the year  a significant achievement in light of the difficult conditions caused by reduced volatility  and thus trading activity  in convertible securities during the year 
high yield revenue high yield revenue  not including new issuance revenues  was million  up over last year 
the increase in high yield revenue was primarily a result of an increase in new issues and tight spreads versus comparable investment grade securities 
convertible revenue convertible revenue  not including new issuance revenues  was million  down from last year 
the decrease relates to a reduction in trading volume caused by overall reduced volatility in the convertible market 
execution revenue execution revenue was nearly million  up over over last year 
the increase in execution revenue was due to the expansion of direct access execution services to a limited number of institutional customers 
for the full year  we executed over billion shares as compared to billion for the comparable period in bonds direct revenue bonds direct revenue was million  up over last year 
the growth was driven by the fixed income business acquired from mellon securities llc in and the expansion of products offered

asset management revenue asset management revenue includes revenues we receive from management and performance fees from funds managed by us  revenues from asset management and performance fees we receive from third party managed funds  and investment revenue from our investments in these funds 
some of our revenues from asset management and performance fees are derived from our own investments in these funds 
asset management revenues were million for  up over last year 
the increase in asset management revenue was a result of management and performance fees on a higher base of assets under management up versus the assets under management and solid performance on our increased investments in managed funds our investments in managed funds were higher than last year 
interest income and expense interest income increased million primarily as a result of increased stock lending activity  and interest expense increased by million primarily as a result of increased stock borrowing activity and additional interest expense associated with the issuance of the million in long term debt in march of compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense was million and million in and  respectively 
compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was in and in compensation and benefits expense includes the cost of salaries  bonuses  the amortization of restricted stock awards and employee benefit plans 
the decrease in compensation and benefits as a percentage of net revenues is attributable primarily to two factors investment banking revenues increased approximately versus as revenues increased  we were able to leverage the fixed costs associated with the support and management of the investment banking department 
the improvement attributable to this may not be sustainable depending on the recurring level and mix of investment banking revenues or the possible need for incremental infrastructure to support more activity 
asset management revenues include investment income from our investment in various managed funds 
relatively  there is less compensation associated with these revenues 
the compensation ratio 
table of contents improvement attributable to the asset management business may not be sustainable as it is highly dependent on performance that is likely to vary 
issuance of stock based compensation to employees we use restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards as incentives for employees to focus on long term value creation and heighten their sensitivity to overall costs and risks as well as to reduce employee turnover 
we issue these awards in lieu of cash compensation 
these awards may be granted to specific individuals in different amounts and subject to different terms and conditions  enabling us to tailor the arrangements to meet specific objectives 
restricted stock and restricted stock units are awarded to employees subject to risk of forfeiture 
typically the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units occurs over a prescribed period of time and requires continued service and employment by the recipient 
restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are valued at the date of grant and are amortized over the vesting period which is typically three to five years 
we also have a voluntary deferred compensation plan dcp whereby our employees may defer cash compensation and elect to receive an amount of deferred shares dcp deferred shares which are exchangeable into shares of our common stock at a future date 
the dcp provides for dcp deferred shares to be credited to an employee based on a discount to the current market price of our common stock 
in  and  the discounts were   and  respectively  to the then current market prices of our common stock 
the compensation deferred is expensed when earned and the discount on the dcp deferred shares is generally expensed immediately 
in addition  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and supplemental stock purchase plan  and we may award shares of our common stock to our employees pursuant to our employee stock ownership plan esop

effects of changes in foreign currency rates we maintain a foreign securities business in our foreign offices london  paris  tokyo and zurich as well as in some of our domestic offices 
most of these activities are hedged by related foreign currency liabilities or by forward exchange contracts 
however  we are still subject to some foreign currency risk 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 
effects of inflation based on today s modest inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  securities and receivables  we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation

risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities market  credit  operational  legal and compliance and new business 
risk management is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments we own is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices and the 
table of contents correlation among them  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
we make dealer markets in equity and debt securities 
to facilitate customer order flow  we may be required to own equity and debt securities in our trading and inventory accounts 
we attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short position 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by us fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we follow industry practices to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
in addition  the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
legal and compliance risk 
legal and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as 
table of contents regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  anti money laundering and record keeping 
new business risk 
new business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product 
by entering a new line of business or offering a new product  we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face 
we review proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities 
other risk 
other risks encountered by us include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups

the statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and was effective for pre existing instruments as of our fourth quarter of however  the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments has been deferred by fsp fas under this fsp  certain mandatorily redeemable shares are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
for the first fiscal period beginning after december  other mandatorily redeemable shares are deferred indefinitely but may be subject to classification or disclosure provisions of the statement 
adoption of the applicable provisions of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  we do not expect that the deferred provisions will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides guidance on the consolidation of certain entities in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
such entities are referred to as variable interest entities vies 
fin requires that a vie be consolidated by a business enterprise if that enterprise is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
fin was effective january  for us with respect to interest in vies that were obtained after that date 
with respect to interests in vies existing prior to february   the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december fin r  which provides technical corrections and extended the effective date of fin to the first reporting period that ended after march  we fully adopted fin r in the second quarter of the current year 
the provisions of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for us in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   which is the third quarter of fiscal we have assessed the impact on adopting this new standard and do not believe that the adoption of sfas no r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting our business the following factors describe some of the assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations 
in addition to the factors mentioned in this report  we are also affected by changes in general economic and business conditions  acts of war  terrorism and natural disasters 

table of contents changing conditions in financial markets and the economy could result in decreased revenues 
as an investment banking and securities firm  changes in the financial markets or economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world could adversely affect our business in many ways  including the following a market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and  therefore  to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads 
unfavorable financial or economic conditions could likely reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting  financial advisory and other services 
our investment banking revenues  in the form of financial advisory and underwriting or placement fees  are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial or economic conditions 
adverse changes in the market could lead to a reduction in revenues from principal transactions and commissions 
adverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and investment income from managed funds and losses from managed funds 
continued increases in our asset management business  including increases in the amount of our investments in managed funds  would make us more susceptible to adverse changes in the market 
our proprietary trading and investments expose us to risk of loss 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from proprietary trading in which we act as principal 
although the majority of our trading is riskless principal in nature  we may incur trading losses relating to the purchase  sale or short sale of high yield  international  convertible  and equity securities and futures and commodities for our own account and from other program or proprietary trading 
additionally  we have made substantial investments of our capital in debt and equity securities  including investments managed by us and investments managed by third parties 
in any period  we may experience losses as a result of price declines  lack of trading volume  and illiquidity 
from time to time  we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security  securities of a single issuer  or securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry 
any downward price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits 
in addition  we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful  could result in losses 
increased competition may adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
all aspects of our business are intensely competitive 
we compete directly with numerous other brokers and dealers  investment banking firms and banks 
in addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business  there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services  including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition involve market focus  reputation  the abilities of professional personnel  the ability to execute the transaction  relative price of the service and products being offered and the quality of service 
increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits 
competition also extends to the hiring and retention of highly skilled employees 
a competitor may be successful in hiring away an employee or group of employees  which may result in our losing business formerly serviced by such employee or employees 
competition can also raise our costs of hiring and retaining the key employees we need to effectively execute our business plan 
operational risks may disrupt our business  result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies  and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people 
table of contents or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
asset management revenue is subject to variability 
asset management revenue includes revenues we receive from management and performance fees from funds managed by us  revenues from asset management and performance fees we receive from third party managed funds  and investment income from our investments in these funds 
some of our revenues from asset management and performance fees are derived from our own investments in these funds 
we experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to the nature of our asset management business and therefore may fail to meet revenue expectations 
asset management revenue may not be sustainable as it is highly dependent on performance that is likely to vary 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business 
we expect the growth of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions and strategic partnering 
as we expand our business  there can be no assurance that our financial controls  the level and knowledge of our personnel  our operational abilities  our legal and compliance controls and our other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and our growth 
the ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects 
in addition  as we acquire new businesses  we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems into ours  including financial controls  accounting and data processing systems  management controls and other operations 
a failure to integrate these systems and controls  and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls  could adversely affect our business and prospects 
our business depends on our ability to maintain adequate levels of personnel 
we have made substantial increases in the number of our personnel 
if a significant number of our key personnel leave  or if our business volume increases significantly over current volume  we could be compelled to hire additional personnel 
at that time  there could be a shortage of qualified and  in some cases  licensed personnel whom we could hire 
this could hinder our ability to expand or cause a backlog in our ability to 
table of contents conduct our business  including the handling of investment banking transactions and the processing of brokerage orders  all of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business is substantially dependent on our chief executive officer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of richard handler  our chief executive officer 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
handler 
the loss of his services could compromise our ability to effectively operate our business 
in addition  in the event that mr 
handler ceases to actively manage the three funds that invest on a pari passu basis with our high yield division  investors in those funds would have the right to withdraw from the funds 
although we have substantial key man life insurance covering mr 
handler  the proceeds from the policy may not be sufficient to offset any loss in business 
extensive regulation of our business limits our activities  and  if we violate these regulations  we may be subject to significant penalties 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
the securities and exchange commission is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws 
in addition  self regulatory organizations  principally nasd and the securities exchanges  are actively involved in the regulation of broker dealers 
securities firms are also subject to regulation by regulatory bodies  state securities commissions and state attorneys general in those foreign jurisdictions and states in which they do business 
broker dealers are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business  including sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers  use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities  capital structure of securities firms  anti money laundering  record keeping and the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
broker dealers that engage in commodities and futures transactions are also subject to regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the national futures association nfa 
the commission  self regulatory organizations  state securities commissions  state attorneys general  the cftc and the nfa may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censure  fine  suspension  expulsion of a broker dealer or its officers or employees  or revocation of broker dealer licenses 
additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the commission or self regulatory organizations  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules  may directly affect our mode of operation and our profitability 
legal liability may harm our business 
many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability  and in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant or co defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages 
the risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
our expansion into private client services involves an aspect of the business that has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional business 
additionally  the expansion of our business  including increases in the number and size of investment banking transactions and our expansion into new areas  imposes greater risks of liability 
in addition  unauthorized and illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability to us 
substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm  which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include inventory position and exposure limits  on a gross and net basis  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit 
table of contents spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and risk limits based on a summary measure of risk exposure referred to as value at risk var 
value at risk in general  value at risk measures potential loss of trading revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon 
value at risk over a one day holding period measured at a confidence level implies the potential loss of daily trading revenue is expected to be at least as large as the value at risk amount on one out of every trading days 
value at risk is one measurement of potential loss in trading revenues that may result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
as with all measures of value at risk  our estimate has substantial limitations due to our reliance on historical performance  which is not necessarily a predictor of the future 
consequently  this value at risk estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
the var data presented below has been scaled down using a one day holding period 
the one day var data below shows the market risk exposures of our trading positions as of december  and due to the benefit of diversification  total var is less than the sum of the individual components 
market risk exposures in trading portfolios one year ending december  average maximum minimum at dec 
 at dec 
 var var var in millions by risk type interest rate currency equity commodity diversification benefit nm a nm a overall a designated as nm because maximum and minimum may occur on different days for different risk components  and hence it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect 
the comparison of daily revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the accuracy of the var model 
backtesting is performed at various levels of the trading portfolio  from the holding company level down to specific business lines 
a backtesting exception occurs when the daily loss exceeds the daily var estimate 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated three exceptions when comparing the one day var with the backtesting profit and loss in an accurate model for the one day  var should have between zero and twelve backtesting exceptions on an annual basis 
backtesting profit and loss is a subset of actual trading revenue and includes only the profit and loss effects relevant to the var model  excluding fees  commissions  certain provisions and any trading subsequent to the previous night s positions 
it is appropriate to compare this measure with var for backtesting purposes because var assesses only the potential change in position value due to overnight movements in financial market variables such as prices  interest rates and volatilities 
the graph below illustrates the relationship between daily backtesting profit and loss and daily var for us in 
table of contents relationship between backtesting p l and var estimate during backtesting p l and var estimates graph trading revenue used in the histogram below entitled vs 
distribution of daily trading revenue is the actual daily trading revenue  which includes not only backtesting profit and loss but also fees  commissions  certain provisions and the profit and loss effects associated with any trading subsequent to the previous night s positions
