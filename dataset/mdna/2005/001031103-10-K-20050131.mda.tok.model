item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business is the manufacturing and marketing of plastic films for use in the packaging  transportation  beverage  food  automotive  pharmaceutical  chemical  electronics  construction  agricultural and textile industries 
we currently have manufacturing operations located in eight countries in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we manufacture plastic films  principally from resins blended with other raw materials 
we may either sell the film or further process it by metallizing  printing  laminating  slitting or converting it 
our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value added products according to the specifications of our customers 
resin costs  depending on the product line  average between and of the cost of goods sold 
since resin costs fluctuate  selling prices are generally determined as a spread over resin costs  usually expressed as cents per pound 
accordingly  costs and profits are most often expressed in cents per pound  and  with certain exceptions  the historical increases and decreases in resin costs have been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny for penny basis 
assuming a constant volume of sales  an increase in resin costs should  therefore  result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin  while a decrease in resin costs should result in lower sales revenues with higher gross profit margins  and thus in both cases with no impact on gross profit 
while we experienced some pricing relief during the second half of fiscal  the frequent increases in resin prices during our first and second quarters of fiscal  resulted in customer resistance and competitive pressure  and we were not able to pass all of these increases to our customers effectively during the fiscal year ended october  this adversely affected our revenue  gross profit and earnings in fiscal resin pricing increased during fiscal in north america and at a much higher rate in our european and asia pacific regions 
in north america  we were able to pass through the current and previous periods resin increases in fiscal  however resin increases in the european and asia pacific markets were not all passed through in fiscal due to the competitive market place 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we had a increase in per pound resin costs and we anticipate future price increases in resin worldwide for the balance of fiscal there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on resin price increases on a penny for penny basis in the future

the increase was primarily due to a increase in per unit selling prices along with an increase of in sales volume

discontinued operations in july  our management approved a plan to dispose of our spanish subsidiary  a component of our european segment  because of its continued losses 
we actively commenced marketing the sale of our spanish subsidiary to interested parties in july in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the disposal of the spanish subsidiary has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  its assets and liabilities have been segregated from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and its operating results are segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the and fiscal years 
our spanish subsidiary had a net loss income from discontinued operations of  and  for the years ended october  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net loss income was due to deterioration in the pvc export business in europe resulting primarily from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through cash flow generated from operations and borrowings by us and our subsidiaries under various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund working capital  including operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures 
our working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october  this million increase in working capital was primarily the result of an increase in trade accounts receivable of million due to increased sales volumes in conjunction with increased unit pricing due to higher raw material costs that was passed though to our customers during the fiscal year 
this increase in raw material costs and volume also increased our investment in inventories during the period by million 
in addition  we received net cash of million from the liquidation of fiap 
the weakening of the united states dollar during fiscal increased translated working capital balances of our foreign subsidiaries by million 
the remaining increases and decreases in components of our net working capital reflect the normal operating activity for the year 
on november   we entered into a loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation  as agent  and the financial institutions named in the agreement  as lenders 
under this agreement the lenders provided a maximum credit facility of million  including a letter of credit facility of up to million 
this credit facility was a three year agreement with our option to extend for two additional one year terms 
we exercised one of the options in august  thereby extending the agreement until november   and we continue to maintain the option to extend one year 
amounts available for borrowing are based upon the sum of eligible domestic values of buildings and equipment at the closing date and eligible accounts receivable and inventories on a monthly basis 
the credit facility is secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and on of our equity ownership in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the agreement contains customary bank covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets  the making of restricted payments and the payment of cash dividends 
if the loan s excess availability  as defined  is less than million  we must meet certain minimum financial covenants and activate a lock box whereby daily cash collections would automatically pay down the credit facility 
in addition  whenever the lock box is activated  we are required to classify our debt outstanding from congress financial corporation as a current liability  which may have a material negative impact on our working capital 
if the loan s excess availability is less than million  we are subject to further restrictions including limitations on inter company funding 
during fiscal the excess availability under this credit facility ranged from million to million 
our excess availability under this facility was million at october  we currently project that our excess availability under this facility will exceed million throughout the october   at a minimum  based upon budgeted financial statements and budgeted cash requirements 
interest payable under this facility is based upon excess availability levels or certain leverage ratios at a margin of prime rate plus 
to for overnight borrowings and libor plus a range of to for libor rate borrowings up to one year 
as of october   there was million outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of under this credit facility 
this credit facility expires in november with the company s option to extend to november the company is expected to be refinanced at that time 
in november  we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due november  debentures 
the issue price was resulting in an effective yield of 
the debentures contain certain customary representations  warranties  covenants and conditions such as  but not limited to  cash flow ratio and certain restrictions on  but not limited to  dividends  consolidations and certain asset sales and additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the debentures at october  in november  we announced that from time to time and as permitted by our various loan agreements  we may repurchase up to million of our senior subordinated notes 
we have made no repurchases during the year ended october  we maintain various credit facilities at our foreign subsidiaries 
at october   the aggregate amount outstanding under such facilities was million  all of which is secured by various assets of the foreign subsidiaries  which may include accounts receivable  inventories  property and machinery and equipment and real estate 
the carrying amount of the collateral at october   was million 
there was million additional availability under these facilities at october  we guarantee certain of the debt of our foreign subsidiaries through corporate guarantees aggregating approximately million at october  there are no existing events of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
borrowings under these facilities are used to support operations at such subsidiaries and are generally serviced by local cash flow from operations 
on july   aep industries packaging espana sa  filed for suspension of payments status under spanish law  which was prompted by a demand for repayment by one of the spanish subsidiary s lending banks 
a payment was remitted to the bank in july of million by the us operations to satisfy this demand 
the suspension of payments status under spanish law allows the debtor to defer current payments to its creditors  which the parties will negotiate the final payment balances 
as a result of the continued losses of the spanish subsidiary  management approved a plan to dispose of the spanish subsidiary through a sale to a third party in july in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the disposal of the spanish subsidiary is being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
after failed attempts to sell the spanish operations  management ceased operations and placed the operation in liquidation on september  our cash and cash equivalents were million at october   as compared to million at october  net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended october   was million  comprised of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash operating charges for depreciation and amortization of million  lifo expense of million  esop expense of million  amortization of debt fees of million  and deferred income taxes of million 
in addition to these positive adjustments we had refunds from the internal revenue service of million  a decrease in other current assets of million and an increase in long term liabilities of million 
these were offset by a provision for subsidiary shutdown of million  increases in net accounts receivable of million  increases in net inventories of million and in other assets of million and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively 
in each period  the net changes in other operating assets and liabilities reflect normal operating activity 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended october   was million  resulting primarily from investments in capital expenditures of million 
this was offset by sales of property and equipment and proceeds from assets held for sale fiap of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended october   was million  reflecting net borrowings of million under available credit facilities and proceeds from stock issuances of million offset by an increase in restricted cash of million resulting from the sale leaseback of equipment in belgium and payments made under capital lease agreements of million 
net cash used in our discontinued operation during the fiscal year ended october  was million  resulting primarily from its net loss and the million repayment of the spanish debt by the us operation 
our aggregate commitments under our loan agreement  senior subordinated notes  foreign borrowings  capital leases and noncancelable operating lease agreements as of october   are as follows for the fiscal years ending october  borrowings capital leases operating leases total commitment amounts in thousands thereafter    we expect to refinance our revolving credit facility  which expires in november with the option to extend to november the credit facility is expected to be refinanced at that time 
we expect to refinance our senior subordinated notes  which mature in november  during fiscal year we expect to use approximately  of cash in the fiap shutdown in fiscal and approximately  of cash for operating costs such as salaries  utilities and professional fees in spain in fiscal we know of no current or pending demands or commitments that will materially affect liquidity  however we have million in approved capital project spending that is scheduled to be incurred in fiscal we have approximately million of unfunded pension benefit obligations at october  for foreign locations 
the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million related to these foreign defined benefit plans during fiscal in november  we exercised our early purchase option in holland for certain operating leases for machinery under a new three year capital lease of which the principal payments aggregates million over term 
we announced in november  that from time to time and as permitted by our various loan agreements  we may repurchase up to million of our senior subordinated notes 
no repurchases were made during fiscal we believe that our cash on hand at october   and our cash flow from operations  assuming no material adverse change  combined with the availability of funds under the current credit facility and credit lines available to our foreign subsidiaries for local currency borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
at october   we had an aggregate of approximately million available under these credit facilities 
effects of inflation inflation is not expected to have significant impact on our business 
contingencies in fiscal  the european commission served our holland subsidiary with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by the subsidiary 
we have cooperated with the european commission in its investigation 
our last written communication with the european commission was in january at this time  no litigation is pending against us or our subsidiary involving this matter  and we are not in a position to evaluate the outcome of this investigation 
however  there can be no assurance that in the event that the european commission serves a statement of objections instituting a proceeding against our holland subsidiary which results in a fine being assessed  that the amount of the fine would not be material 
in february  our new zealand subsidiary was served with two summonses and complaints applicable to a business acquired by the subsidiary on november   and immediately transferred to a joint venture company  rapak asia pacific limited  in which the subsidiary held a interest 
the complaints allege approximately million in damages for defective products manufactured both before and after november  we have referred these complaints to the insurance carriers that we believe are responsible to defend and indemnify our new zealand subsidiary for the alleged liability 
two of the insurance carriers have agreed to defend the actions subject to reservations of rights 
we also believe we may be entitled to indemnification under various agreements 
based on developments to date  we believe that the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  assets held for sale  assets of discontinued operations  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  including customer returns  rebates  promotions and other incentive programs estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or potentially obsolete inventories  lifo inventory valuations  litigation accruals and pension obligations accounting for income taxes  estimating the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluating income tax contingencies derivative instruments cash flow hedges valuation of stock options impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill estimating the costs to shutdown divested entities and the loss from discontinued operations we recognize sales and cost of sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer and records estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebates  returns  promotions or other incentive programs 
customer rebate programs are based upon annual rebate agreements based upon predetermined sales volume requirements and accrued at each customer s agreed rebate percentage 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates of write offs to the average accounts receivable balances over the last months 
when it is deemed probable that a customer account is uncollectible  that balance is added to the calculated reserve 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and may be affected by changes in the general economic conditions 
management reviews our physical inventories at each business unit to determine the obsolescence of the products on hand 
when it determines that we have obsolete inventory  our north america operations scrap these inventory items and our international operations establish the appropriate reserves for these items 
we maintain our united states inventory on the lifo method of inventory valuation  except for supplies 
the lifo inventory is reviewed quarterly for net realizable value and adjusted accordingly 
management s current estimated ranges of liabilities related to pending litigation are based on input from legal counsel and management s best estimate of future costs 
final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and  therefore  have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
we are involved in routine litigation in the normal course of our business and based on facts currently available  we believe such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
we sponsor defined benefit plans for certain foreign employees 
we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with us gaap  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased defined benefit pension expense  in fiscal management accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 an asset and liability approach is required 
such approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
the realizability of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
management assesses the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
should the future taxable income of such entities be materially different from management s estimates  an additional valuation allowance may be necessary in future periods 
such amounts  if necessary  could be material to our results of operations and financial position  as they were in fiscal and management has provided additional valuation allowances during fiscal of million for certain foreign operations because management has determined that it is more likely than not that the current tax benefit will not be fully utilized 
we operate internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to effectively manage these risks  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
we have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we record all of our cash flow hedges in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and as amended by sfas and sfas for a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge of anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity and are recognized in net income loss when the hedged item affects operations 
at the inception of the hedge the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and appropriate documentation is prepared 
on an on going basis  we assess hedge effectiveness for all cash flow designated hedges in order to determine that each derivative continues to be effective 
if the transaction being hedged fails to occur  or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective  changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded immediately in operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement encourages but does not require companies to account for employee stock compensation awards based on their estimate fair value at the date of the grant with the resulting cost charges to operations 
we have elected to continue to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles boards opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we have used our best estimates in establishing the asset impairment charges  provisions  writedowns and reserves recorded as a result of the voluntary liquidation of fiap 
we estimated the net realizable value of fiap s accounts receivable based on an analysis of collections made through october   as well as regarding the collectibility of the remaining customer balances for which payment has not yet been received 
inventories were reviewed at october   and it was determined that no additional reserves were necessary 
the write downs  provisions and reserves relating to the liquidation of fiap were based upon our best estimates given the information available 
actual realizable values or payments to be made may be different from such estimates  and such differences will be recognized as incurred or as better information is received 
net assets held for sale include machinery  land and buildings for the fiap location 
we record net assets held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is based on estimated proceeds from the sale of the facility and equipment utilizing recent buy offers and data obtained from commercial real estate broker 
our estimate as to fair value is regularly reviewed and subject to changes in the commercial real estate markets and our continuing evaluation as to the facility s acceptable sale price 
in july  we approved a plan to dispose of our spanish subsidiary  a component of our european segment  because of its continued losses 
the spanish subsidiary manufactured a range of products in pvc stretch film  primarily for the automatic and manual wrapping of fresh food and for catering film use 
on july   we placed our spanish subsidiary in a suspension of payments status under spanish law 
after failed attempts to sell the spanish operation  management placed the operation into liquidation on september  and is in the process of selling the assets and settling the liabilities of the subsidiary 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the disposal of the spanish subsidiary has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  its assets and liabilities have been segregated from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and its operating results are segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the pre tax loss from discontinued operations includes a charge for employee termination benefits which were determined based on a negotiated plan with the local spanish union 
the results also include a charge for lease termination costs related to the building and are based on negotiations with the landlord 
the estimated losses on disposal includes the write down of machinery and equipment to fair value  less costs to sell  based on recent buy offers and write off of accumulated translation adjustments 
the write downs  provisions and reserves relating to the liquidation of the spanish operation were based upon our best estimates given the information available 
actual realizable values or payments to be made may be different from such estimates  and such differences will be recognized as incurred or as better information is received 
as required by sfas no 
 we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired 
we performed our annual impairment analysis under sfas on september  based on a comparison of our market capitalization to our book value at that date 
we also performed a supplemental estimate of the fair value of our company using comparable industry multiples of cash flows compared to our book value 
our policy is that impairment of goodwill will have occurred if the market capitalization of our company were to remain below book value for a period of more than six months or the estimated value of our company based on cash flow multiples is below book value 
should the carrying value of our company exceed its fair value for other than a temporary period of time  the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired at september  we plan to perform our impairment test at september in each fiscal year 
we also review our financial position quarterly for other triggering events as described in sfas no

clarifies how to apply sfas no 
to the new law s tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities 
the fully phased in deduction is up to nine percent of the lesser of taxable income or qualified production activities income 
the staff proposal would require that the deduction be accounted for as a special deduction in the period earned  not as a tax rate reduction 
fsp no 
 provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that an enterprise is permitted time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
the company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  the company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act

 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect sfas to have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the fourth quarter of fiscal  beginning august  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements about prospects for the future  such as our ability to generate sufficient working capital  amount of excess availability under our credit facility  our ability to continue to maintain sales and profits of our operations and our ability to generate sufficient funds to meet our cash requirements 
we wish to caution readers that the assumptions which form the basis for forward looking statements with respect to  or that may impact earnings or liquidity for  the year ending october   include many factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  availability of raw materials  ability to pass raw material price increases to customers in a timely fashion  the potential of technological changes that would adversely affect the need for our products  price fluctuations which could adversely impact our inventory  and changes in united states or international economic or political conditions  such as inflation or fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking statements or judgments in this section and in other parts of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize these risks through operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates we may use interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at october   there was one interest rate swap outstanding in connection with million bank debt of our netherlands subsidiary 
we were not a party to any interest rate collars or options at october  the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at october   the carrying value of our company s total debt was million of which approximately million was fixed rate debt 
as of october   the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt  which includes the cost of replacing our fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately million 
foreign exchange we enter into derivative financial instruments principally foreign exchange forward contracts against the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and new zealand dollar primarily to hedge intercompany transactions and trade sales and forecasted purchases 
foreign currency forward contracts reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual cash inflows and outflows  resulting from these intercompany and third party trade transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we had a total of and open foreign exchange contracts outstanding at october  and  respectively  with a total notional contract amount of million and million  respectively  all of which have maturities of less than one year 
at october  and  the net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts were losses of million and million  respectively  which are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets and other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also had a total of and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding at october  and  respectively  with a total notional contract amount of million and million  respectively  all of which have maturities of less than six months 
the net fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges were losses of  and  at october  and  respectively  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
our foreign subsidiaries had third party outstanding debt of approximately million on october  such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  thereby reducing our need to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
commodities we use commodity raw materials  primarily resin  and energy products in conjunction with our manufacturing process 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices in connection with these components 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below and the other information in this annual report or incorporated by reference before deciding to invest in  or retain  shares of our common stock 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial  or that we have not predicted  may also harm our business operations or adversely affect us 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition  operating results or liquidity could be materially harmed 
industry risks our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and our ability to pass on price increases to our customers the principal raw materials that we use in our products are polyethylene  polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride resins 
our ability to operate profitably is dependent  in large part  on the market for these resins 
the supply and demand for these resins and the petro chemical intermediates from which they are produced are subject to substantial price fluctuations and market disturbances  including occasional shortages of supply 
prices fluctuate as a result of changes in natural gas and oil prices and the capacity of the companies that produce these products to meet market needs 
our ability to maintain profitability is heavily dependent upon our ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any increase in raw material costs 
if there is overcapacity in the production of any specific product that we manufacture and sell  we frequently are not able to pass through the full amount of any cost increase 
if resin prices increase and we are not able to fully pass on the increases to our customers  our results of operations and our financial condition will be adversely affected 
intense competition in the flexible packaging markets may adversely affect our operating results the business of supplying plastic packaging products is extremely competitive 
we believe that there are few barriers to entry into many of our markets 
as a result  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  competition resulting from new manufacturers of various types of film in our product line 
also  when new manufacturers enter the market for a product or existing manufacturers increase capacity  they frequently reduce prices to achieve increased market share 
companies can also develop products that have superior performance characteristics to our products 
any of these actions by our competitors can adversely affect our sales 
in addition  we face competition from a substantial number of companies  which sell similar and substitute packaging products 
some of these competitors are subsidiaries or divisions of large international diversified companies with extensive production facilities  well developed sales and marketing staffs and substantial financial resources 
competitive products are also available from a number of local manufacturers 
this results in competition which is highly price sensitive 
we also compete on the basis of quality  service  timely delivery and differentiation of product properties 
an increase in competition could result in material selling price reductions or loss of our market share 
this could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which govern our operations and which may result in potential liability our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern discharges into the air and water  the storage  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the remediation of soil and ground water contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or waste  and the health and safety of our employees 
future compliance with these laws and regulations may require material expenditures by us 
in addition  the nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our manufacturing facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters 
we may also be exposed to claims for violations of environmental laws and regulations by previous owners or operators of our property 
in addition  the presence of  or failure to remediate  hazardous substances or waste may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent any property or to use it as collateral for a loan 
we also may be liable for costs relating to the investigation  remediation or removal of hazardous waste and substances from a disposal or treatment facility to which we or our predecessors sent waste or materials 
company risks we experience fluctuations in operating income  which may cause our stock price to fluctuate our operating income loss has been subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations 
these fluctuations can be caused by global economic conditions  competition  variability in raw material prices  acquisitions  asset sales  business restructuring initiatives  seasonality  and foreign currency fluctuations 
these fluctuations make it more difficult for investors to compare our operating results to corresponding prior year periods 
these fluctuations may also cause our stock price to fluctuate 
you should not rely on our results of operations for any particular quarter or year as indicative of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
because we have limited contractual relationships with our customers  our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products we generally do not enter into long term contractual relationships with our customers 
as a result  our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products or  in certain cases  terminate existing orders for which we may have incurred significant production costs 
our business may be adversely affected by risks associated with foreign operations approximately of our revenues are generated from operations conducted outside north america 
conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks  including the following currency fluctuations  inflation  export restrictions  compliance with existing and changing regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in shifting production between different facilities  redundancy costs which limit our ability to reduce staff  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability and economic downturns  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe during the summer months  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we have experienced and may continue to experience any or all of these risks 
any of these factors may materially adversely affect our sales  profits  cash flow and financial position  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we may  from time to time  experience problems in our labor relations of our employees in north america  unions represent employees under three collective bargaining agreements 
two of these agreements expire in february and march and one expires in march we have started negotiations with union representatives for the contracts that expire in further  we have collective bargaining agreements at our international facilities  covering substantially all of the hourly employees at these facilities 
changes in these agreements  over which we have no control  could adversely affect us 
our business may be adversely affected by results of ongoing health and safety studies on plastics and resins continuing studies of the potential effect on health and safety of various resins and plastics  including polyvinyl chlorides  are being conducted by industry groups  government agencies and others 
the results of these studies  along with the development of any other new information  may adversely affect our ability to market and sell certain of our products or may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured by such products  any of which could adversely affect our profits and financial condition 
anti takeover and change of control provisions may adversely affect our stockholders our directors are elected for three year terms  so approximately one third of the board is elected each year 
we are subject to a delaware statute regulating business combinations 
these factors could discourage  hinder or preclude an unsolicited acquisition of our company and could make it less likely that stockholders receive a premium for their shares as a result of any such attempt 
in addition  our board of directors may issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock could have voting  liquidation  dividend or other rights superior to those of the common stock 
therefore  if we issue preferred stock  a person s rights as a common stockholder may be adversely affected 
in connection with our senior subordinated notes offering  we entered into an indenture which requires us  upon a change of control  to offer to purchase the outstanding senior subordinated notes 
if a change of control were to occur and we could not obtain a waiver or if we do not have the funds to make the purchase  we would be in default under the senior subordinated notes  which could depress our stock price 
possible violation of european competition law could adversely affect us in fiscal  the european commission served our holland subsidiary with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by that subsidiary 
we cooperated in this investigation 
no litigation has been instituted against us involving this matter 
however  we are not in a position to evaluate the outcome of the investigation 
if the litigation is instituted  a fine may be assessed 
we are not in a position to predict whether litigation will be commenced and  if commenced  and our subsidiary is found guilty  that the fine would not be material 
financial risks we have a high level of debt relative to our equity  which reduces cash available for our business  may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and increases our vulnerability to economic or business downturns we are highly leveraged and our operations are subject to restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness 
as at october   our total consolidated indebtedness  including short term borrowings and capitalized leases  was approximately million and our total shareholders equity was approximately million 
total indebtedness represented of the total capitalization 
accordingly  we are subject to all of the risks associated with substantial indebtedness  including a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to service our indebtedness  we will have reduced funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and less able to withstand competitive pressures and react to changes in our industry and general economic conditions 
our parent company to some extent finances our foreign subsidiaries  and as these inter company loans increase  our exposure to currency fluctuations and costs associated with these loans increases 
in addition  the indenture under which our million outstanding senior subordinated notes were issued and the loan and security agreement under which a major portion of our other borrowings were made contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility with respect to certain business matters 
if we fail to meet our scheduled debt service requirements  we will need to refinance our indebtedness or sell material assets  and if we fail to do so  a substantial portion of our assets can be sold by the lenders under the loan and security agreement 
if we are unable to meet our future debt service requirements from our cash flow  we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these actions could be taken on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or that we will be able to satisfy our additional capital requirements 
in addition  the terms of the indenture and the loan and security agreement may prohibit us from adopting any of one or more of the alternatives which might otherwise be available 
our borrowings under the loan and security agreement are secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and on of our ownership interest in certain foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  if a default occurs under the loan and security agreement and is not cured  it may result in a substantial reduction or termination of our business 
further  such default would also constitute default under the indenture pursuant to which our senior subordinated notes were issued
