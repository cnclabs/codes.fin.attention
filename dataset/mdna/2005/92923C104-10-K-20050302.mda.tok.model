item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition traditional homebuilding 
we recognize homebuilding revenues when homes close and title to and possession of the property is formally transferred to the buyer 
the majority of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within one or two days subsequent to closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in cash and cash equivalents 
revenue recognition tower homebuilding 
revenue for tower residences under construction is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recorded as a portion of the value of non cancelable tower unit contracts when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being 
table of contents unable to require a full refund except for non delivery of the residence  a substantial percentage of residences are under non cancelable contracts  collectibility of sales prices are reasonably assured and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognized is calculated based upon the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
the percentage of completion method is applied since we meet applicable requirements under sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
actual revenues and costs to complete building construction in the future could differ from our current estimates 
if our estimates of tower revenues and development costs are significantly different from actual amounts  then our revenues  related cumulative profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change 
contracts receivable 
amounts due under tower sales contracts  to the extent recognized as revenue under the percentage of completion method  are recorded as contracts receivable 
we review the collectibility of contracts receivable on a quarterly basis and provide for estimated losses due to potential customer defaults 
historically  approximately to of customers who had noncancelable contracts defaulted on the obligation to close the purchase of the tower unit 
actual contract defaults may differ from our current estimates 
real estate inventories and cost of sales 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations for real estate projects  real estate inventories including land  common development costs and estimates for costs to complete  are allocated to each parcel or lot based on the estimated relative sales value of each parcel or lot  as compared to the sales value of the total project  while site specific development costs are allocated directly to the benefited land 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home and tower construction 
we amortize all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred to cost of sales for homes closed based upon the relative sales values of homes expected to be closed in each project 
when a home is closed  we usually have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we have incurred  estimate to be incurred and expect to be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month 
actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimated amounts 
warranty costs 
we establish warranty reserves for traditional and tower residences by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under our warranty obligation periods 
we provide our single and multi family home buyers with a one to three year limited warranty  respectively for all material and labor and a ten year warranty for certain structural defects 
we provide our tower home buyers a three year warranty for the unit and common elements of the tower 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
capitalized interest and real estate taxes 
we capitalize interest  up to an amount not to exceed total interest incurred  and real estate taxes on parcels  lots  towers and amenity facilities the projects while under active development 
the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use or sale 
the amount of interest capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying the company s weighted average annualized interest rate to the amount of accumulated expenditures related to the projects under development during the period 
for homebuilding projects  land sales and amenities conveyed through equity membership sales  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are apportioned on relative sales value and amortized to cost of sales  respectively  with each home closing  land sale or membership sold 
for tower buildings  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are amortized to cost of sales under the percentage of completion method 
for owned and operated assets  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are included in the base cost of the assets and depreciated 
if the various underlying estimates related to interest capitalization and amortization are revised  then more or less interest and real estate taxes would be capitalized and or amortized to cost of sales 
community development district obligations 
in connection with certain development activities  bond financing is utilized in many of our communities to construct on site and off site infrastructure improvements 
some bonds 
table of contents are repaid directly by us while other bonds only require us to pay non ad valorem assessments related to lots not yet delivered to residents 
we also guarantee district shortfalls under certain bond debt service agreements 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for special assessments and tax increment financing entities  we annually estimate the amount of bond obligations that we may be required to fund in the future 
if our estimates of the amount of bond obligations that we may be required to fund are significantly different from actual amounts funded  our real estate inventories and costs of sales may be revised on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
real estate inventories considered held for sale including land intended for sale and completed tower residences and homes are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment and real estate inventories considered held and used  including land and land improvements  investments in amenities and tower residences and homes under development may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that the asset is impaired  the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if our estimate of the future cash flows is significantly different from actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record impairment 
goodwill 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
several factors are used to evaluate goodwill  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and estimated future revenues and costs 
due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in future goodwill impairment 
litigation 
the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s estimates and assumptions related to these proceedings  or due to the ultimate resolution of the litigation

our principal business lines include single and multi family traditional homebuilding  mid and high rise tower homebuilding and real estate services each of which contributes to our profitability 
in  and of revenues and gross margin  respectively  were derived from our combined homebuilding operations 
during august and september  we experienced flood and wind damage to several of our properties in florida as a result of hurricanes charley  francis  ivan and jeanne 
as of december   we recorded a million expense relating to the damaged properties before considering insurance recoveries 
as further described below  we offset the reported expense for the receipt of million in insurance recoveries and the accrual of an additional million in estimated future insurance recoveries  resulting in net hurricane costs of million 
we have insurance in place that covers damage to our properties and related losses  including certain losses caused by interruption of business 
as of december   we have recorded in accounts receivable million as estimated insurance recoveries related to damages caused by hurricanes charley  francis and jeanne  which is our best estimate of the amount of reimbursement that will be received after considering deductibles and other factors 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million in insurance recoveries related to damages caused by hurricane ivan to our northwest florida properties 
we are in the process of documenting all estimated losses and preparing claims for submission to our insurance carriers 
although we do not believe that we will incur any additional material losses  the final insurance recoveries cannot be determined until additional information is known 

table of contents although our operations for the last half of were significantly impacted by the hurricanes  we achieved an increase in total revenues of due primarily to growth in our traditional and tower homebuilding and real estate services divisions 
net income for the year increased 
the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin from our tower homebuilding division  million received from the sale of our investment in a partnership and million received from the sale of development rights in a previously closed out community 
net income was unfavorably impacted by a decline in gross margins from our traditional homebuilding and amenity membership and operations and an increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses and interest expense 
for  total revenues and net income increased and  respectively  over the increases were driven primarily by our traditional and tower homebuilding and real estate services divisions 
although net income increased only slightly over  gross margins increased due primarily to increased contributions from the traditional homebuilding and real estate services divisions 
gross margins from tower homebuilding  amenities and land sales declined as compared to overall  net income increased slightly due to the increase in gross margin offset by a increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we settled an internal revenue service examination of our tax returns for the years as a result  we reduced our income tax expense by approximately million

we closed units during the year in our northeast us markets while  units were closed in our florida markets  compared to  closed last year in florida 
the decline in home deliveries in the florida markets was due primarily to construction delays caused by the hurricanes and permitting delays 
we anticipate approximately units  with a sales value of million related to the hurricane delay  will close in the number of homes closed in our affordable retirement market increased from while the number of homes closed in our primary move up and luxury second home markets decreased and  respectively 
the decline in the primary move up and luxury second home markets is primarily related to hurricane delays in the southeast florida region and the close out of four communities in the florida markets in  respectively 
revenues were favorably impacted by the increase in the average selling price per home closed 
the increase in the average selling price per home closed was positively impacted by the  average price achieved by our northeast us markets and the  contributed by the florida markets 
lot revenues decreased million due primarily to the near sell out in of lots in one of our communities located in the southeast florida region 
from time to time  we sell certain large lots for custom homes directly to prospective residents or custom homebuilders as part of our strategy to serve a broad range of customers 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was due to the write up of real estate inventories associated with the acquisition of spectrum communities to reflect fair value at the time of purchase and a decline in gross margins from the florida markets 
gross margin percentages for the florida markets decreased to from primarily due to higher raw material and labor costs at one southeast florida community where home deliveries were delayed  the close out of a subdivision in one community located in the southwest florida region and above average incentives and discounts related to the sale and delivery of two luxury model homes 
due to permitting delays  the timeframe from initial customer contract to construction start to home delivery increased by up to as much as to months  thus sales prices were locked in over a year or longer before delivery and our actual costs were higher than previously estimated 
the hurricanes of the third quarter exacerbated the delays and cost 
table of contents increases  making the impact even greater 
other factors impacting gross margin were the million increase in warranty and construction overhead costs 
construction overhead costs increased primarily due to increased salaries and benefits 
the lingering effects of the hurricanes and permitting delays on florida s east coast  as well as the purchase price accounting treatment of our northeast us homebuilding acquisition  is expected to suppress gross margins in the first half of gross margins are expected to begin the year at to  rising to to in the latter half of the year  bringing the average for the year to approximately 
contract values of new orders increased due in part to units and million of new contract values contributed by our northeast us markets and the increase from our florida markets 
contract values for the florida markets increased due to contributions from all regions with the exception of the southeast region which was significantly impacted by the reduced sales at one community as a result of planned sales reductions designed to reduce the gross margin impact of the hurricanes and permitting delays 
although absorption of homes priced in excess of million in certain second home luxury communities located in our florida markets continues to be slow  the overall increase in sales is believed to be attributable to increasing consumer confidence throughout our regions and the completion of the new amenity facilities in existing communities 
the increase in backlog contract values primarily reflects a increase in the backlog units and decrease in the average sales price of homes under contract to  in compared to  in the increase in backlog contract values and units is attributed to a rise in homebuilding sales combined with closing delays in the florida markets due to the hurricanes and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of spectrum communities  which had units and million in backlog at december we expect to deliver approximately million of our backlog within the next twelve months 
our ability to obtain labor  materials and permits in the southeast regions of florida in the aftermath of the hurricanes will impact the timing of delivery of homes in the near future 
as it relates to our homes in backlog  we anticipate an increase in labor and material prices in the southeast and east central regions of florida may negatively impact our gross margin in the near future 
we employ a wide range of sales incentives to market our homes to prospective buyers 
these incentives are an important aspect of our sales and marketing of homes  and we may rely on them more heavily in promoting communities experiencing weaker demand or to promote the sale of completed unsold homes 
without the use of these marketing incentives  our ability to sell homes could be adversely impacted 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased due to a increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in average selling price 
we recorded initial deliveries of homes in three of our communities located in the east central and southwest regions of florida  offset by a decrease in deliveries from two communities closed out in and four communities that were approaching close out in the average selling price per home closed increased as a result of closing a larger proportion of homes in our higher priced communities 
lot revenues increased primarily due to the introduction of a new community and subdivision located in the east central and southeast regions of florida  respectively 
the number of homes closed in our primary move up market increased from  while the number of homes closed in our affordable retirement and luxury second home markets declined and  respectively  from the increase in the primary move up market is attributed to the low interest rate environment and the increase in available product offerings 
the decline in the more affordable retirement and luxury second home markets is primarily related to an unpredictable stock market  geopolitical risks and an uncertain economic outlook 
gross margin percentage increased basis points due primarily to an increase in the average selling price per home closed  which reflects the sale of larger homes with more features and  consequently  higher margins 
we also began the initial delivery of high margin units in a community located in the east central region of florida 

table of contents contract values of new orders increased due primarily to an increase in the average sales price 
the increase in the average sales price per new order was primarily due to sales in three recently introduced higher priced communities and demand for higher priced homes at certain existing communities

in  new towers began recognizing revenue and contributed million to revenues compared to four contributing million in gross margin percentage increased basis points primarily due to the realization of million in construction and sales incentive cost savings on certain recently completed buildings  and the favorable margins realized on delivery of completed tower units 
the gross margin for the year was negatively impacted by a million increase in overhead costs which is due to higher wages and benefits associated with an increase in tower activities in new and existing markets 
contract values of new orders increased due to the conversion to non cancelable contracts of units in towers introduced in with a sales value of million 
the increase in backlog contract values was due to the increase in cumulative contract values partially offset by a increase in cumulative revenues recognized 
the increase in cumulative contract values was due to a million increase in contract values in new and existing towers offset by the million reduction in cumulative contracts associated with the six towers that were completed and delivered to buyers during in  revenue growth of is expected to be provided by the greater number and value of tower units that are sold and under construction 
gross margin percentage may decline since a broader range of moderate priced towers are under construction and planned for initial sales release 
on a long term basis  we expect gross margins in the mid to high range

gross margin percentage declined to from in in addition to the net million increase to our allowance for uncollectability of contracts receivable  the decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a change in the mix of units built and sold toward lower priced  lower margin units  and a million increase in warranty and completion costs recorded in related to three recently completed towers 
gross margins in were positively impacted by the initial percentage of completion recognition of one higher priced  higher margin tower located on the west coast of florida 
contract values of new orders increased in due primarily to the conversion to firm contracts of units in five newly introduced towers with a sales value of  or million average selling price compared to units in seven towers with a sales value of  or  average selling price in in addition to the items noted above  favorable period over period comparisons of revenues and contract values of new orders were impacted by the company s business decision to grant rescission on tower units and the default by customers on closing of five tower units in the quarter ended september  as previously reported 
the resulting impact reduced revenue and gross margin by million and million  respectively 
the increase in backlog contract values was due primarily to the increase in cumulative contract values as a result of the one bal harbour and veracruz tower contract conversions in offset by the increase in cumulative revenues recognized as a result of the increase in the extent of completion of towers under construction in both periods and the completion and delivery of units in nine completed towers during the increase in cumulative contract values reflects an increase in the average sales price of units in backlog

prudential florida wci realty brokerage transaction volume increased to  closings from  in and the average brokerage transaction price increased 
gross margin percentages declined to from due primarily to margin declines in our title and mortgage banking operations 
the decline in title gross margins was due to lower transaction volume as a result of delayed closing transactions related to hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter and increased overhead associated with staff training and operational expansion 
the decline in mortgage banking gross margins was due primarily to the decline in transaction volume and an increase in adjustable rate mortgage business which carries a lower margin 
the decline in overall volume was primarily due to a slowdown in the refinance business

equity membership revenues declined million due primarily to the bulk sale of all remaining equity memberships at the deering bay club in the second quarter of and the decline in demand for luxury equity memberships 
in general  the sale of luxury equity memberships continues to be affected by reduced demand in the southwest florida region 
membership dues and amenity service revenues increased due to the initial operations of new amenity facilities located throughout the florida markets and increasing annual membership fees  offset by decreased revenues as a result of the four hurricanes in the third quarter of the decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to sell out of higher margin marina slips in  the decline in the demand for high margin luxury equity memberships  the increased costs associated with the new amenity facilities that began operations during the year and decreased revenues as a result of the four hurricanes

we believe we have adequate resources and sufficient credit facilities to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated future requirements to acquire capital assets and land  to develop land improvements and construction activities and to meet any other needs of our business  both on a short and long term basis 
if we do not have sufficient capital resources to fund our development and expansion  projects may be delayed  resulting in possible adverse effects on our results of operations 
no assurance can be given as to the terms  availability or cost of any future financing we may need 
if we are at any time unable to service our debt  refinancing or obtaining additional financing may be required and may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  considerable economic and political uncertainties could have adverse effects on consumer buying behavior  construction costs  availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the homebuilding industry generally 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we selectively enter into business relationships through the form of partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated parties 
these partnerships and joint ventures are utilized to acquire  develop  market and operate homebuilding  amenities and real estate projects 
in connection with the operation of these partnerships and joint ventures  the partners may agree to make additional cash contributions to the partnerships pursuant to the partnership agreements 
we believe that future contributions  if required  will not have a significant impact on our liquidity or financial position 
if we fail to make required contributions  we may lose some or all of our interest in such partnerships or joint ventures 
at december   none of our unconsolidated partnerships or joint ventures had outstanding debt 
however  the partners may agree to incur debt to fund partnership and joint venture operations in the future 
standby letters of credit and performance bonds  issued by third party entities  are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts  principally in connection with the development of our projects and land purchase obligations 
at december   we had approximately million in letters of credit outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed 
these bonds  which approximated million at december   are typically outstanding over a period of approximately one to five years 
inflation our costs of operations may be impacted by inflation to the extent that a strengthening economic environment places upward pressure on the cost of labor and materials 
in addition  certain raw materials used by us in our homebuilding operations are susceptible to commodity price increases 
unless these cost increases are passed on to customers through increased home and service prices  our operating margins may be reduced 
in addition  in times of inflation  the reduced availability of attractive mortgage financing for purchasers of our homes may have an adverse effect on sales 
if interest rates increase  construction and financing costs  as well as the cost of borrowings  also would increase  which can result in lower operating margins 
the volatility of interest rates could have an adverse effect on our future operations and liquidity 
among other things  these conditions may affect adversely the demand for housing and the availability of mortgage financing and may reduce the credit facilities offered to us by banks  investment bankers and mortgage bankers 
forward looking statements as we enter  we expect increased revenues from all lines of business as demand for our products is expected to grow 
assuming the current economic environment continues  including increased consumer confidence  a stronger stock market and moderately increasing interest rates  we expect to produce a or greater increase in earnings 
if economic conditions deteriorate  interest rates increase significantly  the ability to obtain permits and approvals for land development is delayed or adverse legislation or regulations occurs  then it may be difficult to achieve earnings growth
