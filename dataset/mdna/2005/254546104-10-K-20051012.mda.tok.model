all of these new products were well received by the industry and our customers 
fiscal was not without challenges 
the year started strongly in the first half with good performance across all our major markets and regions 
growth in the second half was slower  primarily due to a softer demand in the life sciences market and a challenging comparison with last year s nonrecurring sales in japan that arose from new drinking water regulations

 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas  accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf in september  which delayed the effective date of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas no 
which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement to stock compensation awards using the black scholes option pricing model issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
further  the adoption of sfas r will require additional accounting related to income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 

table of contents the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas on stock compensation awards  using the black scholes option pricing model  are disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
although such pro forma effects of applying original sfas may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effect of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by the company to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas r 
the company will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective application method beginning july  under this method sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas the company estimates that it will recognize compensation expense of million million in fiscal related to its adoption of sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
which eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance

this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
at the present time  the company does not believe that adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates summary 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns and allowances  bad debts  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  warranty and installation provisions  and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition policy 
the company derives revenues from the sale of products  the delivery of services to its customers  including installation and training  and from maintenance  which includes product repair obligations under extended warranty  unspecified software upgrades  telephone support and time and material repairs 
generally  the company s products contain embedded software that is essential to their functionality 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition and statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  or service performed  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement 
in all cases  the portion of revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer or the services are performed 
delivery of the product is generally considered to have occurred when shipped 
undelivered elements in the company s sales arrangements  which are not considered to be essential to the functionality of a product  generally include product accessories  installation services and or training that are delivered after the related products have been delivered 
installation consists of system set up  calibration and basic functionality training and generally requires one to three days depending on the product 
vendor specific objective evidence for product  product accessories and training services is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  if not sold separately  when the price is established by authorized management 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
these estimated hours for installation have historically been accurate and consistent from product to product 
however  to the extent these estimates were to reflect unfavorable variability  the company s ability to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such element could be impacted which in turn could delay the recognition of the revenue currently allocated to the delivered elements 
the company recognizes revenue under extended warranty arrangements maintenance fees ratably over the period of the related maintenance contract and cost of the time and material repairs when incurred 
maintenance consists of product repair obligations under extended warranty  unspecified software upgrades  telephone support and time and material repairs 
the company s equipment typically includes a one year warranty 
the estimated cost of product warranty claims is accrued at the time the sale is recognized  based on historical experience 
while the company believes its historical experience provides a reliable basis for estimating such warranty cost  unforeseen quality issues or component failure rates could result in future costs in excess of such estimates  or alternatively  improved quality and reliability in its products could result in actual expenses that are below those currently estimated 
the company s sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  independent credit reports  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
historically  we have not experienced significant sales returns or bad debt losses 

table of contents we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we estimate revisions to inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  projections of future demand and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional valuation provisions may be required 
if demand or market conditions are more favorable than projected  higher margins could be realized to the extent inventory is sold which had previously been written down 
long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill 
we assess for the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above or other indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair values of related reporting units to their carrying values 
we are required to perform an impairment review for goodwill at least annually 
taxes on income 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to revise the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and stock prices of marketable securities 
with the exception of the stock price volatility of our marketable equity securities  we manage our exposure to these and other risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through our hedging activities 
our policy is not to use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we deal with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the risk of nonperformance by any one institution on any financial instrument 
separate from our financial hedging activities  material changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices could cause significant changes in the costs to manufacture and deliver our products and in our customers buying practices 
we have not substantially changed our risk management practices during fiscal and do not currently anticipate significant changes in financial market risk exposures in the near future that would require us to change our risk management practices 
foreign currency exchange 
revenues generated from international operations are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations of intercompany account balances 
market value gains and losses on these hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged  and the net financial impact is not expected to be material in future periods 
at june   the company had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million dollars  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen  million australian dollars and  in canadian dollars 
at june   the company had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million dollars  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen  and  in canadian dollars 
the foreign exchange contracts at the end of each fiscal year mature within the first quarter of the following fiscal year 
additionally  contract values and fair market values are the same 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to our hedging contracts and underlying balances being hedged at june  and  indicated that these market movements would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents foreign currency rate fluctuations can impact the us dollar translation of our foreign operations in our consolidated financial statements 
currency fluctuations increased reported sales by in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal interest and investment income 
our interest and investment income is subject to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at june  and indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on our actual balances and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements 
debt and interest expense 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt balance at june   indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
there was no outstanding debt at june  actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements and the level of borrowings maintained by the company
