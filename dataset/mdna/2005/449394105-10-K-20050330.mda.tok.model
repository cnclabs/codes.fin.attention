item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed below and in the section entitled risk factors 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic products 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have funded our research and development primarily from equity derived working capital  through strategic alliances and collaborations with other companies and through government research funding  primarily from the national institutes of health in the form of grants and contracts 
we have not been profitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in july  we entered into a collaboration with genencor for vaccines to treat or prevent hepatitis b virus  hepatitis c virus and human papilloma virus 
pursuant to the agreement  we exclusively licensed to genencor our padre and epitope technologies for vaccines to treat or prevent hepatitis b  hepatitis c and human papilloma virus 
in connection with this collaboration  we received an upfront license fee  which was amortized over the collaboration term 
in addition  genencor made an initial ten percent equity investment in epimmune common stock at a premium to the market price 
the agreement provided for us to receive up to a total of approximately million in payments  including the initial equity investment but excluding royalties 
in january  we received a payment from genencor for achievement of the first milestone  identification of a product candidate to treat chronic hepatitis b infection 
in february  we announced we had earned a milestone payment from genencor as a result of genencor filing an ind for a vaccine to treat hepatitis b 
the milestone payments were recognized as revenue when received 
the collaboration revenues were recognized as incurred 
in addition  genencor fully funded epimmune s research in these specific indications and was obligated to pay us royalties on sales of any products that may have been developed under the collaboration 
all revenues from genencor have been included in related party revenue 
the initial collaboration had a term through september  and in october  was extended to september in march  genencor assigned its rights under the collaboration and license agreements to innogenetics nv  which does not own an equity position in epimmune and is not a related party 
in connection with the assignment to innogenetics  we extended the collaboration term with innogenetics through september and are now amortizing the remaining unamortized portion of the license fee over this extended term 
in addition  genencor agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the epimmune common stock it held  without our prior approval  for a minimum of twelve months 
innogenetics has the right to terminate the collaboration early  upon three months written notice  if epimmune breaches its obligations under the collaboration agreement or upon certain force majeure events 
in september  we announced a reduction of our work force aimed at focusing our efforts on our most advanced clinical programs and our sponsored and partnered programs 
we reduced our research and administrative staff by individuals or  which resulted in a one time restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of in september  dr 
loria  our president and ceo surrendered an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  including  unvested shares  at the fair market value of per share  in exchange for the prepayment of the outstanding principal and interest under a promissory note issued by dr 
loria in january for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the aggregate value of the shares surrendered was  the remaining  unvested shares vested in equal daily installments between september  and january  in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non cash  stock based compensation charge of approximately  in the third quarter of based on the difference between the fair market price on september  and the exercise price of the shares surrendered by dr 
loria 
we also recognized an additional  in non cash  stock based compensation charges ratably over the period from september  to january  as the remaining  unvested shares vested 
in september  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock to selected institutional and accredited investors  including current shareholders  for a total purchase price of million 
we received net proceeds of million 
the purchase price of each security  which is the combination of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of one share of common stock  was priced at the market value of  which was the sum of the average of the closing bid price of epimmune common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market for the five days up to and including september   and  the imputed value of a warrant to purchase of one share of common stock 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to a placement agent for services rendered in connection with the private placement 
each warrant  including the warrant issued to the placement agent  has a three year term and an exercise price equal to of or per share 
we filed a registration statement to permit registered resales of the common stock and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants sold in the transaction 
the registration statement was declared effective on october  in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock to selected institutional and accredited investors  including current shareholders  for a total purchase price of million 
we received net proceeds of million 
the purchase price of each security  which is the combination of one share of common stock and  for each two shares of common stock purchased  a warrant to purchase one share of common stock  was priced at the market value of  which was equal to or greater than the sum of the closing bid price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market on the date of execution of the purchase agreements  and  the imputed value of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to a placement agent for services rendered in connection with the private placement 
each warrant  including the warrant issued to the placement agent  has a three year term and an exercise price equal to of or per share 
we filed a registration statement to permit registered resales of the common stock and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants sold in the transaction 
the registration statement was declared effective on may  subsequent events on march   we announced that we had agreed to combine our business with idm  a privately held company based in france  pursuant to a share exchange agreement 
the all stock transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies 
in addition  certain institutional investors  strategic partners and executives of idm who collectively hold more than of idm s outstanding stock including shares issuable upon exercise of warrants have entered into the share exchange agreement thus far 
the closing of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including approval by our shareholders 
upon closing of the transaction  the combined company will be named idm  inc and its shares are expected to trade on the nasdaq national market under the ticker idmi 
the combined company will focus on immunotherapeutic products for cancer and selected infectious diseases 
pursuant to the share exchange agreement  we will acquire all of the outstanding share capital of idm  with certain exceptions related to shares and a warrant held in french share savings plans  in exchange for shares of our common stock  and idm will become our subsidiary 
each share of idm will be exchanged for approximately shares of our common stock  and the former shareholders of idm will hold  in the aggregate  approximately of our common stock  on a fully diluted basis  immediately following the closing of the transaction 
in connection with the transaction  our outstanding series s and series s preferred stock will be exchanged for a total of  shares of our common stock 
the share exchange agreement also sets forth the terms for treatment of outstanding options and warrants to purchase idm shares in the transaction 
subsequent to the transaction  idm will effectively control us 
as a result  the transaction will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition  whereby for financial reporting purposes  idm is considered the acquiring company 
hence  the historical financial statements of idm will become our historical financial statements and will include our results of operations only from the acquisition date forward 
the shares we will issue in the exchange will not be registered under us securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the us absent registration or unless an applicable exemption from the registration requirements is available 
we will file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued in the transaction following the closing of the transaction 
we will issue common stock equal to more than of our outstanding voting shares pursuant to the share exchange agreement and will therefore have to obtain shareholder approval of the transaction in accordance with nasdaq rules 
we will file a proxy statement and hold a meeting of our shareholders to approve the share exchange agreement and certain related actions including changing our name to idm  inc the combined company will be headquartered in san diego following the closing of the transaction  and will have manufacturing sites in irvine  california and paris  france 
the combined company will have approximately employees 
dr 
jean loup romet lemonne  chairman and chief executive officer of idm will be ceo of the combined company  dr 
emile loria  our president and ceo  will be president and chief business officer of the combined company and bob de vaere  our chief financial officer  will be chief financial officer of the combined company 
idm s lead product candidate  mepact  has completed phase iii clinical trials in the us for the treatment of osteosarcoma 
mepact has received orphan drug status in both the us and europe  and idm is working with us and eu regulatory agencies regarding the process for obtaining product marketing approval 
in addition to mepact  the combined company will have a portfolio of six product candidates in clinical development  including one product candidate in phase ii iii clinical trials and two product candidates in phase ii clinical trials 
the forgoing statements regarding the proposed transaction between us and idm includes forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the possibility that the proposed transaction with idm may not ultimately close for any of a number of reasons  such as our not obtaining shareholder approval of the transaction or related matters  failure of holders of at least of the outstanding stock of idm to become parties to the definitive agreement  the possibility that idm shareholders who have not become parties to the definitive agreement make an alternative bid regarding a transaction involving idm to the idm shareholders pursuant to rights under the shareholders agreement among the idm shareholders and  if so  that the idm shareholders accept that bid instead of the transaction with us  and the possibility that nasdaq will not approve the listing of the combined company s shares for trading on the nasdaq national market  and that  in the event the transaction is completed  the combination of us and idm may not result in a stronger company  that the technologies and clinical programs of the two companies may not be compatible and that the parties may be unable to successfully execute their integration strategies or realize the expected benefits of the transaction 
significant accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  patents and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
collaboration revenues are earned and recognized as research costs are incurred in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
license fees are earned and recognized in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
upfront license fees for perpetual licenses where we have no performance obligations are recognized when received 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recognized over the term of the agreement 
for example  in connection with our genencor collaboration  which has now been assigned to innogenetics  because we received an upfront license fee  it is being amortized into revenue over the collaboration term 
fees paid to initiate research projects are deferred and recognized over the project period 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the completion of the milestone as long as the milestone event was substantive  and its achievability was not reasonably assured at inception and our performance obligations after milestone achievement will continue to be funded at a comparable level before the milestone achievement 
revenues from grants are recognized on a percentage of completion basis as related costs are incurred 
we defer revenue recognition until performance obligations have been completed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
patents we capitalize the costs incurred to file patent applications when we believe there is a high likelihood that the patent will issue and there will be future economic benefit associated with the patent 
these costs are amortized over a ten year life from the date of patent filing 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
in addition  we review the carrying value of patents for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents or we determine that the carrying value is impaired  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of the abandonment 
investment policy the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving competitive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we primarily invest in cash and money market accounts as well as a or p or higher rated debt securities with maturities of less than two years  with the weighted average maturity not to exceed eighteen months 
we also attempt to minimize our portfolio risk by placing constraints on how much of our portfolio may be held in a specific type of investment such as asset backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations as well as limiting our holdings in any one issuer 
at december   our investment portfolio included only cash and money market accounts and had no fixed income securities 
results of operations we had total revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  relates primarily to a million increase in research grants and contract revenue  offset by a million decrease in related party revenue and a million decrease in licensing and milestone revenue 
the increase in research grants and contract revenue during was primarily due to reimbursement under grants and contracts received from the nih in late and and recognition of reimbursements under our collaboration agreement with innogenetics as contract revenue rather than related party revenue following genencor s assignment of its rights under our collaboration and license agreements to innogenetics in march innogenetics does not own an equity position in epimmune and  therefore  is not a related party and reimbursements under our collaboration agreement with them are now recorded as contract revenue 
the decrease in related party revenue during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was also a result of the assignment by genencor to innogenetics and the corresponding change in revenue accounts 
overall  we received million less in licensing  milestone and contract revenues from the programs previously partnered with genencor and now partnered with innogenetics during as compared to two of the partnered programs have advanced to clinical development or late stage preclinical development and did not require the same level of support from us during as they did in in connection with the assignment by genencor  we extended the collaboration term with innogenetics through september innogenetics will have the right to terminate the collaboration early  upon three months written notice 
the decrease in licensing and milestone revenue during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a result of previously received evaluation and license option fees being fully amortized into revenue by the end of we had total revenue of million for the year ended december  and million for the year december  a decrease of million in related party revenue from genencor in was offset by an increase of million in licensing fees and milestone revenue and a million increase in research grant and contract revenue during the decrease of million in related party revenue in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the shift in focus of our collaboration with genencor from scientific research activities  the part of the collaboration in which we were most involved  to preclinical development on the lead program in support of a late investigational new drug  or ind  filing by genencor  lower non recurring milestone payments received in compared to  and an increase in the time period during which the license fees previously paid by genencor were amortized due to the extension of the collaboration term 
the change in the estimated life of the license occurred due to the extension of the collaboration term from september  to september  the agreement term was extended in october of the increase of million in licensing fees and milestone revenue in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was due to the receipt of one time payments for license fees and milestones during under the terms of our agreement with anosys  and an increase in licensing revenue as a result of amortization of evaluation fees and license fees received from aventis  idm  beckman coulter  merck and amgen in  compared to the increase of million in grant and contract revenue in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was due to higher reimbursable expenses on several existing grants and contracts during than in and reimbursement of expenses on a new contract we received in september of from the nih to develop a preventive hiv vaccine 
a significant portion of our research and development expense is related either to work performed under grants and contracts from the nih or to work we perform under a collaboration agreement with innogenetics 
under our nih grants and contracts  we are able to invoice the nih each month for direct research and development expenses we incur  such as our internal labor costs  and for outside costs such as subcontractors working for us on a specific program 
we are also able to invoice for fringe costs related to our labor and for overhead expenses  both at prescribed rates negotiated in advance with the government 
in some instances  we are also able to invoice a fixed fee  negotiated with the nih in advance for a specific program 
in the largest of our current programs  a contract with the nih for developing a preventative hiv vaccine with a total potential value of million over five years  we have been authorized to spend  or invoice  up to million through september  which represents the first two years of the program 
thus far  as of december   we have incurred costs of approximately million on this program  and have invoiced the nih for million 
under our collaboration agreement with innogenetics  our employees record their actual time worked on the collaboration each day and at the conclusion of each month  we determine the number of full time equivalent employees  on an annualized basis  who worked on the collaboration 
we then invoice innogenetics at a negotiated  annualized rate per full time equivalent employees who worked on the collaboration during the month 
the annualized rate at which we invoice is intended to include the direct labor as well as fringe and overhead expenses related to and in support of the direct labor 
a description of our research and development programs and their status is included in business above 
we have programs in various stages of research and development and  given that plans for additional research and development and  if applicable  commercialization depend upon  among other things  the outcome of testing at each stage of research and development and regulatory review  it is not possible for us to determine when  if ever  these programs might be completed or the costs to complete these programs 
risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development programs are described in risk factors above 
research and development expenses were million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in was primarily due to a million increase in sponsored research related to our subcontractors on nih grants and contracts and a million increase in outside costs related to clinical trials 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in labor and associated costs as a result of our workforce reduction in september  and a million reduction in purchases of vaccine supplies for clinical trials 
research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  was primarily due to lower outside costs related to preclinical activities such as formulation and toxicology studies for our hiv and lung and colorectal cancer product candidates which had all entered clinical trials by  lower scientific supplies costs related to completion of preclinical activities  lower patent and intellectual property related expenses  and reduced labor costs related to our work force reduction  partially offset by higher costs associated with outside research support related to our high throughput screening contract with the nih and outside research and development support on a new contract we received in september of from the nih to develop a preventive hiv vaccine 
general and administrative costs decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decrease during compared to relates primarily to higher comparative operating expenses in which included recognition of non cash  stock based compensation charges of million in connection with the prepayment of a promissory note by dr 
emile loria  our president and chief executive officer in september  a million write off in of legal  investment banking  accounting and other expenses related to our proposed merger with anosys  which was terminated  and a million reduction in labor and associated costs in as a result of our work force reduction in september this was partially offset by million in costs in associated with our proposed combination with idm  sa general and administrative costs were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  was due to recognition of million in non cash  stock based compensation charges in connection with the prepayment of a promissory note by our ceo in september  other non cash  stock based compensation expenses related to a higher stock price for variable stock equity instruments  and the write off of million in legal  investment banking  accounting and other expenses related to our proposed merger with anosys  which was terminated 
the increases were partially offset by a reduction in consultant fees and other outside costs  and a reduction in travel expenses 
in september  we announced a reduction of our work force aimed at reducing our cash burn and focusing our efforts on our most advanced clinical programs and our sponsored and partnered programs 
we reduced our research and administrative staff by individuals or  which resulted in a one time restructuring charge of approximately  in the year ended december  we had no restructuring related charges in or net interest income was approximately million in compared to million in and million in interest income during included approximately million of interest accrued on the note issued for the purchase in january of our common stock by dr 
loria  our president and chief executive officer  compared to approximately million of interest accrued on the note in we had lower average cash balances in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we had lower average cash balances and rates of return in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we expect to incur operating losses over at least the next several years due to continuing expenses associated with our research and development programs  including clinical trials  preclinical testing and development activities 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing and amounts of revenues received and expenses incurred  and such fluctuations may be substantial 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of our equity securities  two public common stock offerings  license fees  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues  capital and operating lease transactions  certain asset divestitures and interest income 
through december  we have raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities  of which million was raised to fund the business since the formation of our business related to immunotherapy 
as of december   we had  shares outstanding on an as converted to common stock basis  assuming conversion of the series s and s preferred shares 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million private placement we completed in april  partially offset by million of cash used to fund our research and development and clinical activities  million of cash used for capitalized patent costs and million of cash used to purchase capital equipment 
our operating expenses were offset by license fees  milestone payments and grant and contract revenues we received 
we expect to continue to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund our ongoing and future clinical trials  as well as our drug research and development programs 
we had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the expenditure for was primarily for the purchase of equipment to support our ongoing clinical trials 
the expenditures for were primarily for small laboratory equipment 
the expenditures for were primarily for laboratory equipment to increase and improve immunological screening throughput  to build out additional laboratory space to accommodate additional employees and for information technology equipment and upgrades to accommodate new employees 
in the past  we have financed our laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through operating lease arrangements and a note payable 
we did not have any outstanding notes payable in during  we made payments of million and fully paid off our outstanding note payable 
during  we made payments of million under the notes payable 
during  we anticipate that payments related to capital expenditures will decrease compared to levels to approximately million 
we will also pay approximately million in rent on our lease commitments during the future minimum rental commitment for the lease of our facility will range from approximately million to million each year over five years  based upon pre established annual rent increases 
payments related to capitalized patent expenses were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to reflects continuation of our efforts to consolidate our intellectual property portfolio and control our outside legal expenses 
the decrease in compared to was due primarily to consolidation of our patent portfolio with one outside law firm to limit administrative redundancies as well as bringing certain administrative tasks in house to limit outside legal expenses 
we expect payments related to patents to be relatively flat in compared to as funds are available  we expect our net cash burn to increase in compared to levels as a result of costs related to ongoing clinical trials in connection with our ongoing drug research and development programs  research and development activities on sponsored programs and contracts  preclinical testing of product candidates and manufacturing of clinical supplies 
we intend to seek collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners and us government agencies 
we have in the past and may in the future also license to third parties some of our technology in markets that we are not pursuing ourselves or through our collaborations 
any agreements that may result from these discussions may not successfully reduce our funding requirements or  if entered into  may be terminated 
we will continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development  including amounts spent for manufacturing clinical supplies  conducting clinical trials for our product candidates and advancing development of certain sponsored and partnered programs 
therefore  we will need to secure additional funding  in addition to the approximately million we raised in april we do not have committed external sources of funding and may not be able to obtain any additional funding  especially if volatile market conditions persist for biotechnology companies 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding  we will be required to delay  further reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development projects  sell the company or certain of its assets or technologies  or dissolve and liquidate all of its assets 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have incurred and will continue to incur legal  accounting and other transaction costs in connection with our proposed combination with idm 
if we do not complete the proposed combination as planned  our cash position will be further reduced  and it will likely be even more difficult to raise additional funding on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our future operational and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including whether our proposed transaction with idm is successfully completed  whether we are able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  the costs associated with our ongoing phase i ii clinical trial for our vaccine targeting hiv  which began in september  including the status of our contract with the nih  the costs associated with our phase ii clinical trial for our vaccine targeting lung cancer  which began in december  progress with other preclinical testing and clinical trials in the future  our ability to establish and maintain collaboration and license agreements and any government contracts and grants  the actual revenue we receive under our collaboration and license agreements  the actual costs we incur under our research collaboration with bavarian nordic  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and any other proprietary rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing research relationships  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  and the magnitude of our drug discovery and development programs 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  our commercial success will depend in part on not infringing upon the patent or other proprietary rights of others and maintaining the technology licenses upon which our products might be based 
our business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with our ability to enter into and maintain new collaborations  the lengthy regulatory approval process  and potential competition from other products 
even if our products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  our inability to fund clinical development of such products  or the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical to market 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than years years more than total year years unaudited in thousands operating lease obligations licensing and purchase obligations deferred compensation total facilities lease  which expires in march licensing and purchase obligations includes an estimate of  for future payment obligations under existing license agreements which may become due and payable in the periods specified based on projected achievement of triggering events  although there can be no assurance such events will be achieved in the projected time frames  if at all 
projections do not include obligations under any of our agreements related to the conduct of clinical trials as these agreements may generally be terminated with days notice 
recently issued accounting standards as permitted by the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share included in note to the consolidated financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s at december   our investment portfolio included only cash and money market accounts and had no fixed income securities 
there would be no material impact to our investment portfolio  in the short term  associated with any change in interest rates and any decline in interest rates over time will reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income
