item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto included under item of this annual report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to future results of the company 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to management decisions and various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to changes in political and economic conditions  changes in demand for the company s products  acceptance of new products  changes in conditions in the various geographic markets where the company does business  technology developments affecting the company s products  changes in laws and regulations  and those matters discussed in the company s filings with the sec 
accordingly  actual circumstances and results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require  in some cases  that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
estimates are based on currently known facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and these differences could be material 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
this occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent retailers or  in the case of ethan allen owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
the company permits retail customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments  and terms offered by the company are standard for the industry 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
retail store acquisitions the company accounts for the acquisition of retail stores and related assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires application of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
business insurance reserves the company has insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject to various stop loss limitations 
the company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although management believes that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
the company adjusts insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves the company has a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  tax liabilities  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the company s counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
basis of presentation as of june   ethan allen interiors inc has no material assets other than its ownership of the capital stock of ethan allen inc and conducts all significant transactions through ethan allen inc  therefore  substantially all of the financial information presented herein is that of ethan allen inc results of operations ethan allen s revenues are comprised of i wholesale sales to independently owned and company owned retail stores and ii retail sales of company owned stores

retail segment 


adjustment for inter company profit 


consolidated operating income

represents the change in the inventory profit elimination entry necessary to adjust for the embedded wholesale profit contained in ethan allen owned store inventory existing at the end of the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for fiscal totaled million  representing a decrease of million  or  from fiscal consolidated revenue of million 
net sales for the period reflect the delivery of product associated with a slight decline in total booked orders  and the resultant lower level of backlog noted throughout most of the year 
the modest decrease in net sales for the current year was due  primarily  to i inconsistent consumer spending habits noted throughout much of the last twelve months likely attributable to ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the threat of further interest rate increases  rising fuel prices and a decline in the stock markets  and ii the company s current year transition to everyday pricing from periodic sale events conducted in the prior year 
these factors were partially offset by the continued re positioning of the company s retail stores to larger and more prominent locations and the impact of recent product introductions 
overall  sales volume for the period was impacted by increased industry competition and the continued use of highly promotional pricing strategies by the company s competitors 
total wholesale revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year decrease was attributable to a decline in the incoming order rate noted during the period  particularly within the company s case goods operations  partially offset by increased throughput within the company s upholstery operations  and improved service position  resulting in shorter delivery cycle times  within certain imported product lines 
total retail revenue from ethan allen owned stores for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase in retail delivered sales by ethan allen owned stores was attributable to an increase in sales generated by newly opened including relocations or acquired stores of million  partially offset by decreases in comparable store delivered sales of million  or  and closed stores  which generated million fewer sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of ethan allen owned stores decreased to as of june  as compared to as of june  during that twelve month period  the company acquired stores from  and sold stores to  independent retailers  closed stores and opened stores of which were relocations 
comparable stores are those which have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations of newly opened stores 
stores acquired from retailers are included in comparable store sales in their th full month of ethan allen owned operations 
total booked orders  which include wholesale orders and written business of ethan allen owned retail stores  decreased from the prior year 
year over year  wholesale orders decreased while ethan allen owned store orders increased and comparable store written business increased 
the modest increase in retail written sales was likely attributable to the continued re positioning of the company s retail stores to larger and more prominent locations 
during the year  the company increased distribution of the furnishing solutions by ethan allen direct mail magazine  distributing approximately million copies which represents a increase over historical annual levels 
these positive factors were likely offset  to some degree  by the current year transition to everyday pricing from periodic sale events conducted in the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal totaled million and was effectively unchanged from prior year 
consolidated gross profit was favorably impacted by a higher proportionate share of retail sales to total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  an overall increase in retail sales volume as a result of the company s continued re positioning of its store network  and a reduction in costs associated with excess capacity at the company s manufacturing facilities 
these favorable variances were offset by gross profit declines resulting  primarily  from i an overall decrease in wholesale shipments  ii ordinary inefficiencies within the company s case goods operations associated with the production of first cuts for new collections  and iii price increases within selected raw material categories  namely lumber  foam  plywood and steel 
consolidated gross margin increased to for the year ended june  from in the prior year as a result  primarily  of the factors identified previously 
operating expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in the current year from million  or of net sales  in the prior year  which included restructuring and impairment charges  net of million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to i the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year  ii cost savings attributable to the closure of selected plant locations in recent periods  and iii a decrease in advertising costs within the wholesale segment stemming from the company s decision to increase distribution of the company s direct mail magazine in lieu of more costly national television advertising 
these favorable variances were partially offset by costs associated with the continued re positioning of the company s retail stores to larger and more prominent locations  and increased distribution expenses attributable to higher fuel and freight charges 
the company s initiative to re position its retail store network has resulted in higher costs associated with managerial salaries and benefits  occupancy  credit card fees  advertising  and delivery and warehousing 
operating income was million  or of net sales  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended june   which included restructuring and impairment charges  net of million

the increase of million  or  is primarily attributable to i the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year  ii a decrease in advertising costs  particularly as it relates to national television advertising  iii a reduction in costs associated with excess capacity at the company s manufacturing facilities  and iv cost savings attributable to the closure of selected plant locations in recent periods 
these decreases were partially offset by i an overall decline in wholesale sales volume  ii price increases within selected raw material categories  iii an increase in selling expenses primarily related to the increased distribution of the company s direct mail magazine  and iv an increase in distribution expenses attributable to higher fuel and freight charges 
operating income for the retail segment increased million  or  to million  or of net retail sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net retail sales  in fiscal the increase in retail operating income generated by ethan allen owned stores is primarily attributable to higher sales volume generated from newly opened including relocations or acquired stores  and the gain recorded upon the sale of selected retail stores 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to the continued re positioning of the company s retail store network  and  to a lesser extent  the sell off of floor inventory necessary to make room for new product introductions 
interest and other miscellaneous income  net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due  primarily  to a decrease in interest income associated with the lower cash balances maintained during the period  and the favorable settlement of an outstanding legal matter during the prior year period 
income tax expense for the year ended june  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended june  the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the higher effective tax rate is a result of recently enacted changes within certain state tax legislation  and increased state income tax liability arising in connection with the operation of a greater number of company owned stores  some of which are located in new jurisdictions 
for fiscal  the company recorded net income of million as compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share totaled in the current year and per diluted share in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal consolidated revenue of million 
net sales for the period reflect the delivery of product associated with an increased level of booked orders and related backlog noted throughout most of the year 
such order levels are reflective of i the continued expansion and strategic re positioning of the company s retail segment  and ii an increase in the incoming order rate resulting  primarily  from an increased level of consumer confidence and an improved us economy  both of which were sustained for much of the last twelve months  and from the success of recent product introductions  some of which have been introduced in accordance with the company s everyday value pricing strategy 
these positive factors were partially offset  to some degree  by softer business conditions during the last three months of the fiscal year likely attributable to consumer concerns with respect to rising fuel prices  the threat of increasing interest rates  and the continued unsettled geo political environment 
total wholesale revenue for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal  representing a million increase 
as stated previously  the company experienced an increase in the incoming order rate as a result  primarily  of improved consumer spending habits and a sustained strengthening of the us economy throughout most of the fiscal year 
to a lesser extent  wholesale sales volume was also positively impacted by two additional shipping days in the current year as compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increases were lower than anticipated shipments stemming from i longer lead times on selected case good items as a result of the re allocation of production associated with the closure of two plants announced in april  and ii modest delays in receiving certain upholstery related import shipments both finished goods and raw materials 
total retail revenue from ethan allen owned stores for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase in retail delivered sales by ethan allen owned stores was attributable to an increase in sales generated by newly opened including relocations or acquired stores of million  and an increase in comparable store delivered sales of million  or  partially offset by a decrease resulting from closed stores  which generated million fewer sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of ethan allen owned stores increased to as of june  as compared to as of june  during that twelve month period  the company acquired stores from an independent retailer  closed store and opened stores  of which were relocations 
the company owned store count at june  also reflects the net addition of stores stemming from ethan allen s acquisition of the minority interest in a joint venture previously established in between the company and an independent retailer  the purpose of which was to own and operate stores in the dallas market 
subsequent to the company s acquisition of the minority interest  the assets of store were sold to the joint venture partner 
while the operations of these stores have been reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements since inception of the joint venture as a result of the company s majority ownership  the stores have not been previously included in the company s store count due to the fact that the stores were independently managed 
total booked orders  which include wholesale orders and written business of ethan allen owned retail stores  increased from the prior year 
year over year  wholesale orders increased while ethan allen owned store orders increased and comparable store written business increased 
these increases are indicative of the continued expansion and strategic re positioning of the company s retail segment  an increase in consumer confidence and a period of sustained economic improvement for most of the last twelve months 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to a higher proportionate share of retail sales to total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and an overall increase in sales volume as a result of the company servicing the increased level of backlog noted throughout much of the past year 
these favorable variances were partially offset by increased costs associated with unabsorbed overhead at the company s manufacturing facilities resulting  primarily  from excess capacity  particularly during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and  to a lesser extent  a modest decline in retail gross profit as a result of the sell off of floor inventory necessary to make room for new product introductions

the fiscal consolidation involved the closure of two case good manufacturing facilities  which resulted in a headcount reduction totaling approximately employees  employees effective june   and employees throughout the first quarter of fiscal the fiscal consolidation involved the closure of three smaller manufacturing facilities  two of which were case good plants 
closure of these facilities resulted in a headcount reduction totaling approximately employees  employees effective april   and employees throughout the last quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal the costs incurred in closing these facilities consisted  primarily  of employee severance and benefits and other plant exit costs  as well as fixed asset impairment charges  primarily for real property and machinery and equipment associated with the closed facilities 
adjustments totaling million were recorded during fiscal to reverse certain accruals previously established in connection with the fiscal consolidation plan which were no longer required 
including restructuring and impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  operating expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended june  from million  or of net sales  for the year ended june  this increase is primarily attributable to the continued growth of the retail segment and the higher proportionate share of retail sales to total sales in fiscal such expansion has resulted in higher costs associated with occupancy  designer salaries and commissions  and delivery and warehousing 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in selling expenses within the wholesale division as a result of a continued company wide focus on cost containment  particularly within national television advertising  as well as initiatives undertaken in recent periods to streamline the company s us manufacturing operations and increase production efficiencies

the decrease in inventory levels since june was the result  primarily  of a decline in work in process inventories attributable to the consolidation of two manufacturing facilities  announced in april  and the related phase out of those plants production during the current period  as well as better company wide management of inventories 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in i finished goods inventories  attributable to recent increases in the wholesale incoming order rate and an increase in retail sales volume  and ii raw material inventories  resulting from the purchase of lumber  fabric  and purchased frames in anticipation of future production needs 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal as compared to cash provided of million in fiscal and cash utilized of million in fiscal the current year over year decrease in cash of million was due  primarily  to i a million decrease in net cash proceeds from the sale of short term investments  ii a million increase in other capital spending  exclusive of acquisitions  to million from million in the prior year  and iii a million increase in cash utilized to fund acquisition activity retail stores were acquired in the current year as compared to retail stores acquired in the prior year

details of those arrangements for which the company  or any of its consolidated subsidiaries  act as guarantor or obligor are provided below 
retailer related guarantees ethan allen inc has obligated itself  on behalf of one of its independent retailers  with respect to a million credit facility the retailer credit facility comprised of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
this obligation requires the company  in the event of the retailer s default under the retailer credit facility  to repurchase the retailer s inventory  applying such purchase price to the retailer s outstanding indebtedness under the retailer credit facility 
the company s obligation remains in effect for the life of the term loan which expires in april the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that the company could be required to make under this obligation is limited to the amount outstanding under the retailer credit facility at the time of default subject to pre determined lending limits based on the value of the underlying inventory and  as such  is not an estimate of future cash flows 
no specific recourse or collateral provisions exist that would enable recovery of any portion of amounts paid under this obligation  except to the extent that the company maintains the right to take title to the repurchased inventory 
management anticipates that the repurchased inventory could subsequently be sold through the company s retail store network 
as of june   the amount outstanding under the retailer credit facility totaled approximately million  of which million was outstanding under the revolving credit line 
management expects that  based on the underlying creditworthiness of the respective retailer  this obligation will expire without requiring funding by the company 
however  in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  a liability has been established to reflect the company s non contingent obligation under this arrangement as a result of modifications made to the retailer credit facility subsequent to january  as of june   the carrying amount of such liability is less than  indemnification agreement in connection with the company s joint venture arrangement with united kingdom based mfi furniture group plc  ethan allen inc has entered into a tax cross indemnification agreement with the joint venture partner

at the present time  management anticipates that the joint venture will continue to operate for the foreseeable future 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that the company could be required to make under this indemnification agreement is indeterminable as no such tax liability currently exists 
further  the nature  extent and magnitude of any such tax liability arising in the future as a result of an adverse tax judgment or change in applicable tax law cannot be estimated with any reasonable certainty 
it should be further noted that no recourse or collateral provisions exist that would enable recovery of any portion of amounts paid under this indemnification agreement 
management expects  based on its current understanding of the applicable tax laws and the existing legal structure of the joint venture  subject to future changes in applicable laws and regulations  this cross indemnity agreement will expire without requiring funding by the company

product warranties the company s products  including its case goods  upholstery and home accents  generally carry explicit product warranties that extend from three to five years and are provided based on terms that are generally accepted in the industry 
all of the company s independent retailers are required to enter into  and perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of  a warranty service agreement 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and makes periodic adjustments to those provisions to reflect actual experience 
on rare occasion  certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
in certain cases  a material warranty issue may arise which is beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that  from time to time  additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience

impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its profitability during the last three fiscal years 
in the past  the company has generally been able to increase prices or seek lower cost alternatives in order to offset increases in operating costs and effectively manage its working capital 
income taxes at june   the company has  for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
the company s utilization of these nols  which expire in  is limited  pursuant to section c of the internal revenue code  based upon the separate earnings and or eventual liquidation of the wholly owned subsidiary to which the nols relate 
business outlook the company has experienced inconsistent business activity throughout much of the last twelve months 
during that time  macro economic factors such as the ongoing war in iraq  rising fuel prices  the threat of further interest rate increases  and recent declines in the stock markets  appear to have contributed to lower levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending  particularly for home furnishings 
in addition  the company s current year transition to everyday pricing in lieu of its historical periodic sale events  likely also had some effect on order trends as compared to prior periods 
despite these challenges  the company believes it is well positioned for the next phase of economic growth as a result of i its established brand  ii its comprehensive complement of home decorating solutions  and iii its vertically integrated business model 
should the economy strengthen  however  it is also possible that costs associated with production including raw materials and labor  distribution including freight and fuel charges  and retail operations including compensation  delivery and warehousing  occupancy and advertising expenses may continue to increase 
similarly  continued increases in interest rates and crude oil prices could serve to further adversely impact the level of discretionary spending on the part of consumers 
we cannot reasonably predict when  or to what extent  such events may occur or what effect  if any  such events may have on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the industry remains extremely competitive with domestic manufacturers facing increased pricing pressure as a result of the continued development of manufacturing capabilities in other countries  specifically within asia 
in response to these pressures  a large number of us furniture manufacturers and retailers  including ethan allen  have increased their overseas sourcing activities in an attempt to maintain a competitive advantage and retain market share 
at the present time  the company manufactures and or assembles approximately of its products 
management of the company continues to believe that a balanced approach to product sourcing  which includes the domestic manufacture of certain product offerings coupled with the import of other selected products  provides the greatest degree of flexibility and is the most effective approach to ensuring that acceptable levels of quality  service and value are attained 
further discussion of the specific issues facing the home furnishings industry has been included under item i of this annual report

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
as of june   the company had no debt instruments outstanding with variable interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is primarily limited to its operation of five ethan allen owned retail stores located in canada as substantially all purchases of imported parts and finished goods are denominated in united states dollars 
as such  gains or losses resulting from market changes in the value of foreign currencies have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations
