item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
see risk factors under item of this report regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in as of march   we have grown to restaurants  including company operated and franchise locations 
we position our restaurants in the high quality  fresh  distinctive and affordable fast casual fresh mexican grill food segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become the leading brand in this industry segment 
during  we continued to improve our economic model by focusing on improving operations execution  undertaking new marketing initiatives  rolling out our new fresh and affordable menu  and continuing controlled unit growth 
as a result of these initiatives  we posted our highest revenues  earnings  and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization in company history 
in addition  our comparable store sales increased  which is the highest full year increase since rubio s became public in in  we gained the benefit of four new restaurants opened during the year and nine new acquired stores opened in our results were primarily due to our success in improving the performance of our existing restaurants by growing sales and controlling costs 
our focus has been on continuous improvement in our existing restaurants economic model 
this includes working to increase our average unit volumes and to reduce costs  which results in improvement in our operating margins 
in  our operating margins increased by to  up from in during  we were also able to grow sales by continuing to offer periodic promotions  by introducing a new radio advertising campaign in our major markets  and by introducing our new fresh and affordable menu 
all of these factors drove traffic into our units  which resulted in an increase in comparable store sales of 
importantly  in june  after extensive testing  we introduced our new fresh and affordable menu 
the menu features most of rubio s favorites  plus new items  many bundled with drinks and side dishes  or with price reductions to be more affordable everyday 
the goal of our menu is to maintain our heritage of offering distinctive fish and seafood items  while expanding our offerings of chicken  pork  and beef items 
we believe providing a wide variety of fresh  rubio s only high quality  fresh  and distinctive items  now even more affordable  will continue to improve our overall financial performance by attracting new guests and increasing the frequency of visits by existing guests 
we experienced the full benefit of our new menu beginning in the third quarter of we were able to realize cost improvements through a variety of initiatives implemented during the second half of and early we continue to work diligently to control food and labor costs  and have instituted additional safety programs to reduce workers compensation costs  an area that drove the majority of our increase in labor costs in the first half of we have also focused on reducing our product costs by continuously working with our suppliers to seek the best prices available in the market and through strong daily management at the restaurant level 
importantly  we were able to mitigate much of the industry s commodity cost increases in by managing or reducing costs in areas that did not impact quality 
in addition  our new menu caused reductions in our cost of sales as we were able to increase our transactions  as well as shift the mix of our products sold to more profitable items 
we believe that our focus on improving the economic model in our existing restaurant system in positions us well for the future 
this focus has allowed us to improve our average unit volume from  at the end of to  at the end of in  we opened four new company owned restaurants  two in the san diego area and two in the los angeles area  and replaced two existing san diego restaurants with expiring leases with two new units in key trade areas 
we also entered into a food service agreement with the new petco park baseball stadium in san diego  where we serve our fish tacos  quesadillas and burritos at three separate concession areas located throughout the stadium 
as a result of our historical expansion  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new unit opens  it will typically incur higher than normal food and labor costs until new personnel gain experience 
hourly labor schedules are gradually adjusted downward during the first three months following the opening of a restaurant  in order to reach operating efficiencies similar to those at established units 
in calculating our comparable restaurant base  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for fiscal periods 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis including those relating to impairment of assets  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current information available  and actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us asset impairment and store closure expense reversal we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when a restaurant experiences a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or a store closure 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual restaurants that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets at each restaurant  we recognize an impairment loss to reduce the assets carrying amounts to their estimated fair value for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of based on the discounted projected cash flows derived from the restaurant 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis are those used to estimate a restaurant s future cash flows 
we use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on restaurant specific information 
if the significant assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating restaurant assets may be overstated or understated  as well as the related impairment charge 
we estimate that it takes a new restaurant approximately months to reach operating efficiency 
any restaurant open months or less  therefore  is not included in the analysis of long lived asset impairment  unless other events or circumstances arise 
we make decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
we record losses associated with the closure of restaurants at the time the unit is closed 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the expected closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
the amount of our store closure liability  and related store closure charge  may change if we are successful in either terminating a lease early or obtaining a more favorable sublease  or if any of our sublesees default on their leases 
asset impairment and store closure expense are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to these restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because of the factors used to estimate impairment and store closure expense  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for a portion of our workers compensation insurance program 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranged from  during our claim year ended october  to  during our claim year ended october  insurance liabilities are accounted for based on the value of independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss incurred 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of industry wide historical claim loss development 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve  and our operating expenses will increase or decrease accordingly 
consistent with trends the restaurant industry has experienced in recent years  particularly in california where claim loss trends are among the highest in the country  workers compensation liability premiums continue to increase 
revenue recognition revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
franchise revenue is comprised of i area development fees  ii new store opening fees  and iii royalties 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements under individual franchise agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis as the individual franchised restaurants subject to the development agreements are opened 
new store opening fees are recognized as revenue in the month a franchised location opens 
royalties from franchised restaurants are recorded in revenue as earned 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between fiscal   and refer to the week periods ended december   december   and december   unless otherwise indicated 
the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  with respect to certain items included in our statements of operations 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor  occupancy and other general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses asset impairment and store closure expense reversal loss on disposal sale of property operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss as a percentage of restaurant sales the following table summarizes the number of restaurants december  december  december  company operated franchised total revenues total revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted from several factors first  our four fiscal store openings contributed sales of million  second  stores opened before fiscal but not yet in our comparable store base contributed sales of million  and third  comparable store sales contributed million  for a total increase of 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease of million in sales from the one store that closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the one store that closed in the second quarter of fiscal units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in comparable stores sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a increase in transactions  combined with a increase in the average check amount 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily due to sales of million from our seven store openings in fiscal and two converted franchise stores  million in sales generated by a full twelve months of operations from units opened in fiscal that were not yet in our comparable unit base  and an increase in comparable store sales of million  for a total of 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in sales from the four stores that closed in fiscal and million from the four stores sold to a franchisee in fiscal the increase in comparable stores sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a increase in the average check amount  offset by a decrease in transactions 
costs and expenses cost of sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in the number of company operated restaurants 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of sales decreased to in fiscal  as compared with in fiscal  while remaining consistent with fiscal s percentage of 
the percentage improvement in fiscal as compared with fiscal  is a direct result of the initiatives we started in the last half of fiscal to reduce product costs back to fiscal levels 
during the majority of fiscal  we experienced higher food and paper costs associated with our larger portions  more menu variety  expanded salsa bar and upgraded packaging for our brand repositioning  combined with a strong discount promotion during the second quarter 
in addition  our new menu variety resulted in an anticipated shift in our product mix from lower priced fish menu items to higher priced chicken and steak menu items 
in an effort to reduce these costs  during the last quarter of fiscal  we selected several new vendors  renegotiated contracts with existing vendors  and switched to less expensive packaging  in addition to implementing a small price increase 
restaurant labor  occupancy and other costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of our ability to leverage our costs with the increase in our revenue  combined with lower labor and unit operating costs as well as lower workers compensation expenses 
generally  operating costs were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal  as many operating expenses in a retail unit are semi fixed  and therefore  represent a lower percentage of revenue when retail sales increase 
in addition  labor and unit operating expenses were higher in fiscal than in fiscal and in fiscal as we incurred higher training  supply  repair  and uniform costs associated with our brand repositioning mentioned in the discussion of cost of sales above 
workers compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal remained consistent with fiscal amounts due to a strong company wide focus in fiscal  as well as the implementation of accident prevention programs 
increased workers compensation expenses in fiscal as compared with both fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to a million increase in our reserve during the second quarter of fiscal actual loss development  which impacts our workers compensation expenses  may be better or worse than the loss development estimated by our actuary  which could positively or negatively impact our results of operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  these costs were in both fiscal and fiscal  and in fiscal these costs increased during fiscal as compared with fiscal and fiscal primarily as a result of increased bonus expense in fiscal due to improved operating results 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the four new units opened since december   combined with the two new units that replaced existing units with expiring leases during this same time period 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in depreciation expense due to the previously planned closure of one store and to the impairment charge  both of which were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal pre opening expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in and million in fiscal during fiscal  we opened six restaurants compared to nine during fiscal  and eight during fiscal costs were higher in fiscal primarily due to two factors 
first  four of the restaurants opened in fiscal were located further away from our home base  causing our training team to incur higher travel costs 
second  costs were incurred during fiscal for two units that opened during costs were lower in fiscal due in part to the fact that two of the restaurants opened in fiscal were replacement units  and  as such  training costs were minimal 
asset impairment and store closure expense reversal was comprised of a  net reversal in fiscal  as compared with a charge of million  net  during fiscal and a reversal of  net  during fiscal the  reversal in fiscal was the net effect of a  increase to reflect additional expenses incurred to find a suitable sublessee  combined with a  reversal to reflect additional sublease income received 
the million charged during fiscal was the net result of a million charge for asset impairment and a million net reduction in our store closure reserve 
the million charge related to the impairment of sixteen under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
of these locations  five were outside california and four had been previously partially impaired in fiscal all of the associated restaurants are expected to remain open through the end of their lease terms  generally from to the assets impaired at these under performing locations consisted of leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment 
fair value of the leasehold improvements was determined based on discounted cash flows and the lower of the net book value or an estimate of current liquidation value for fixtures and equipment 
the three factors that led to the impairment charge were the lower than anticipated increases in comparative store sales  higher than anticipated operating costs associated with our system wide brand repositioning program  and escalating workers compensation costs 
the million net reduction in our store closure reserve was due to a million increase to reflect the difficulty in identifying suitable sublessees  and the resulting continuation of lease payments  and a decrease of million from favorable lease terminations 
during fiscal  we recorded a store closure reversal of million based primarily on lease terminations and subleases that were more favorable than the original estimates and lower severance charges 
this reversal was offset by a charge of million to reflect additional costs we expected to incur on our remaining lease obligations 
other income expense  net increased to income of  in fiscal  compared to expense of  in fiscal and expense of  in fiscal interest income increased as our investments rose from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal interest expense declined from fiscal to fiscal as we paid down our line of credit 
we repaid our line of credit completely in fiscal  resulting in zero interest expense for fiscal the provision for income taxes for fiscal   and is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income 
during fiscal  we reduced our fiscal projected annual rate due to our tax planning initiatives 
the tax rate applied to fiscal comprises the federal and state statutory rates reduced primarily for tax benefits associated with state tax credits and losses previously not benefited 
the tax benefit applied to fiscal comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax loss of million for fiscal the tax rate applied to fiscal comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax income of million for fiscal seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease  utility  labor and insurance costs 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor  and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our guests 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to workers compensation insurance and utility expense has had a material impact on our results of operations in and liquidity and capital resources since we became public in  we have funded our capital requirements through bank debt and cash flow from operations 
we generated million in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of property and the sale maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of property and the sale maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of million in proceeds received from exercises of common stock options 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was comprised of million in principal payments to pay off our line of credit  partially offset by million in proceeds received from exercises of options to purchase common stock 
on october   we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of million related to our workers compensation policy that matured in october the letter of credit is subject to automatic extension one year from the expiration date and thereafter  unless notification is made prior to the expiration date 
on december   this letter of credit was increased to million related to the workers compensation insurance policy that matures in october we were also required  per the terms of both letters of credit  to pledge collateral of million in and million in  which is included in long term investments on our balance sheet 
we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million for restaurant openings  remodels  maintenance  and for corporate and information technology 
we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant  including approximately  in rent holiday expenses 
we believe that the anticipated cash flow from operations combined with our cash and short term investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  total thereafter in thousands company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases we lease restaurant and office facilities and real property under operating leases expiring through we have leased all of our facilities  except for one building  to minimize the cash investment associated with each unit 
most of our leases are for year terms and include options to extend the terms 
the majority of our leases also include fixed rate and percentage of sales rent provisions  and most require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
in addition  we are on the master leases for franchise locations 
these locations were previously company operated before they were sold to a franchisee 
once they were sold to the franchisee  sublease documents were executed  and the franchisee began to pay rent directly to the landlords 
if this franchisee defaults on its subleases  we would be responsible for the rent for the balance of the lease term  which is estimated to be million at december  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures that we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations  or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump sum payment to the landlord less than the sum of all remaining future rents 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities 
variable interest entities are entities that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or lack sufficient equity to finance activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is obligated to absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or is entitled to receive the majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin r also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the company has adopted fin r  however  this adoption had no impact on the company s results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and generally requires the cost associated with employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments be measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r also provides guidance on how to determine the grant date fair value for awards of equity instruments as well as alternative methods of adopting its requirements 
sfas no 
r is effective for the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period after june  as disclosed above  based on the current assumptions and calculations used  had we recognized compensation expense based on the fair value of awards of equity instruments  net earnings would have been reduced by approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments primarily with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of corporate and municipal bonds 
as of december   we had no investments with maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of investment and debt instruments the company has  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates would not have a significant negative affect on our financial results 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of less than one year 
we do not believe that these purchase commitments are material to our operations as a whole 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
