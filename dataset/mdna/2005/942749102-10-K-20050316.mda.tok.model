customers and markets we sell our products to plumbing  heating and mechanical wholesale distributors  major diy chains and oems 
wholesalers 
approximately of our sales in and were to wholesale distributors for both commercial and residential applications 
we rely on commissioned manufacturers representatives  some of which maintain a consigned inventory of our products  to market our product lines 
diy 
approximately and of our sales in and  respectively  were to diy customers in north america 
our diy customers demand less technical products  but are highly receptive to innovative designs and new product ideas 
our diy sales over the past several years have increased as a result of our development of unique new products and successful merchandising efforts and the expansion of the market with the large national chains 
oems 
approximately and of our sales in and  respectively  were to oems in both north america and europe 
in north america  our typical oem customers are water heater manufacturers  equipment manufacturers needing flow control devices and water systems manufacturers needing backflow preventers 
our sales to oems in europe are primarily to boiler manufacturers and radiant systems manufacturers 
our largest customer  the home depot  inc  accounted for approximately million  or  of our total net sales in and million  or  of our total net sales in our top ten customers accounted for approximately million  or  of our total net sales in and million  or  of our total net sales in thousands of other customers comprised the remaining of our net sales in and of our net sales in marketing and sales we rely primarily on commissioned manufacturers representatives  some of which maintain a consigned inventory of our products 
these representatives sell primarily to plumbing and heating wholesalers or service diy store locations in north america 
we also sell products for the residential construction and home repair and remodeling industries through diy plumbing retailers  national catalog distribution companies  hardware stores  building material outlets and retail home center chains and through plumbing and heating wholesalers 
in addition  we sell products directly to certain large oems and private label accounts 
manufacturing we have integrated and automated manufacturing capabilities  including bronze and iron foundries  machining  plastic injection molding and assembly operations 
our foundry operations include metal pouring systems  automatic core making  yellow brass forging and brass and bronze die castings 
our machining operations feature computer controlled machine tools  high speed chucking machines with robotics and automatic screw machines for machining bronze  brass and steel components 
we have invested heavily in recent years to expand our manufacturing base and to ensure the availability of the most efficient and productive equipment 
we are committed to maintaining our manufacturing equipment at a level consistent with current technology in order to maintain high levels of quality and manufacturing efficiencies 
capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for each of the last three years were as follows years ended december  in millions capital expenditures depreciation raw materials we require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic  and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
we have experienced increases in the costs of bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and crude oil 
the price of copper has risen approximately since december  bronze and brass are copper based alloys 
since december   we have experienced cost increases in bronze and brass of approximately and  respectively 
since december   we have experienced cost increases in cast iron and steel of and  respectively 
additionally  due to the increase in crude oil  the costs of our certain plastic resins increased approximately since december  in response to recent cost increases  we have implemented price increases for some of the products  which have become more expensive to manufacture due to the increases in raw material costs 
as a result of these price increases  we believe we have been successful in offsetting most  if not all  of the cost increases 
we are not able to predict whether or for how long these cost increases will continue 
if these cost increases continue and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases  our profit margins could decrease 
code compliance products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
standards are established by such industry test and certification organizations as the american society of mechanical engineers asme  the canadian standards association csa  the american society of sanitary engineers csa  the university of southern california foundation for cross connection control usc fcc  the international association of plumbing and mechanical officials iapmo  factory mutual iapmo  the national sanitation foundation nsf and underwriters laboratory nsf these standards are incorporated into state and municipal plumbing and heating  building and fire protection codes 
national regulatory standards in europe vary by country 
the major standards and or guidelines which our products must meet are afnor france  dvgw germany  uni icin italy  kiwa netherlands  svgw switzerland  sitac sweden and wras united kingdom 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of plumbing codes 
we maintain stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements 
we believe that product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which creates a barrier to entry for competitors 
additionally  a majority of our manufacturing facilities are iso  or certified by the international organization for standardization 
product development and engineering we maintain our own product development  design teams  and testing laboratories in north america  europe and china that continuously enhance our existing products and develop new products 
we maintain sophisticated product development and testing laboratories 
our efforts in this area have been particularly successful in the diy market  which values innovation in product design 
research and development costs included in selling  general  and administrative expense amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
competition the domestic and international markets for water safety and flow control devices are intensely competitive and require us to compete against some companies possessing greater financial  marketing and other resources than ours 
due to the breadth of our product offerings  the number and identities of our competitors vary by product line and market 
we consider brand preference  engineering specifications  plumbing code requirements  price  technological expertise  delivery times and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors 
we believe that new product development and product engineering are also important to success in the water industry and that our position in the industry is attributable in part to our ability to develop new and innovative products quickly and to adapt and enhance existing products 
we continue to develop new and innovative products to enhance market position and are continuing to implement manufacturing and design programs to reduce costs 
we cannot be certain that our efforts to develop new products will be successful or that our customers will accept our new products 
although we own certain patents and trademarks that we consider to be of importance  we do not believe that our business and competitiveness as a whole are dependent on any one of our patents or trademarks or on patent or trademark protection generally 
backlog backlog was million at february  we do not believe that our backlog at any point in time is indicative of future operating results 
employees as of december   our wholly owned and majority owned domestic and foreign operations employed approximately  people 
none of our employees in north america or china are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in some european countries our employees are subject to the traditional national collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our employee relations are good

we maintain product liability and other insurance coverage  which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices 
nonetheless  such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims 
contingencies james jones litigation as previously disclosed  on june   nora armenta the relator filed a civil action in the california superior court for los angeles county the armenta case against james jones company james jones  mueller co  tyco international us  and the company 
we formerly owned james jones 
the relator filed under the qui tam provision of the california state false claims act  cal 
govt 
code et seq 
california false claims act and generally alleged that james jones and the other defendants violated this statute by delivering some defective or non conforming waterworks parts to thirty four municipal water systems in the state of california 
the relator filed a first amended complaint in november and a second amended complaint in december  which brought the total number of plaintiffs to in june   the trial court excluded cities from this total of  and the relator was not able to obtain appellate modification of this order  which can still be appealed at the end of the case 
to date  of the named cities have intervened  and attempts by four other named cities to intervene have been denied 
one of the allegations in the second amended complaint and the complaints in intervention is that purchased non conforming james jones waterworks parts may leach into public drinking water elevated amounts of lead that may create a public health risk because they were made out of bronze alloy uns no 
c and contain more lead than the specified and advertised bronze alloy uns no 
c 
this contention is based on the average difference of about lead content between bronze to lead and bronze to lead and the assumption that this would mean increased consumable lead in public drinking water that could cause a public health concern 
we believe the evidence and discovery available to date indicates that this is not the case 
in addition  bronze is used extensively in municipal and home plumbing systems and is approved by municipal  local and national codes 
the federal environmental protection agency also defines metal for pipe fittings with no more than lead as lead free under section of the federal safe drinking water act 
in this case  the relator seeks three times an unspecified amount of actual damages and alleges that the municipalities have suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in damages 
she also seeks civil penalties of  for each false claim and alleges that defendants are responsible for tens of thousands of false claims 
finally  the relator requests an award of costs of this action  including attorneys fees 
in december  the los angeles department of water and power ladwp intervened in this case and filed a complaint 
we settled with the city of los angeles  by far the most significant city  for million plus attorneys fees 
co defendants contributed million toward this settlement 
in august  an additional settlement payment was made for million million from us and million from james jones  which settled the claims of the three phase i cities santa monica  san francisco and east bay municipal utility district chosen by the relator as having the strongest claims to be tried first 
this settlement payment included the relator s statutory share  and the claims of these three cities have been dismissed 
in addition to this million payment  we are obligated to pay the relator s attorney s fees 
after the phase i settlement  the court permitted the defendants to select five additional cities to serve as the plaintiffs in a second trial phase of the case 
contra costa  corona  santa ana  santa cruz and vallejo were chosen 
the company and james jones then reached an agreement to settle the claims of the city of santa ana for a total of  an amount which approximates santa ana s purchases of james jones products during the relevant period 
the santa ana settlement was approved by the court and then completed  and the trial of the remaining phase ii cities claims is presently scheduled for october we have a reserve of approximately million with respect to the james jones litigation in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we believe  on the basis of all available information  that this reserve is adequate to cover the probable and reasonably estimable losses resulting from the armenta case and the insurance coverage litigation with zurich american insurance company zurich discussed below 
we are currently unable to make an estimate of the range of any additional losses 
on february   after our insurers had denied coverage for the claims in the armenta case  we filed a complaint for coverage against our insurers in the california superior court the coverage case 
james jones filed a similar complaint  the cases were consolidated  and the trial court made summary adjudication rulings that zurich must pay all reasonable defense costs incurred by us and james jones in the armenta case since april  as well as such future defense costs until the end of the armenta case 
in july  the california court of appeal affirmed these rulings  and  on december   the california supreme court denied zurich s appeal of this decision 
this denial permanently established zurich s obligation to pay armenta defense costs for both us about million plus future costs and james jones about million plus future costs  and zurich is currently making payments of incurred armenta defense costs 
however  as noted below  zurich asserts that the defense costs paid by it are subject to reimbursement 
in  the trial court made a summary adjudication ruling that zurich must indemnify and pay us and james jones for amounts paid to settle with the city of los angeles 
zurich s attempt to obtain appellate review of this order was denied  but zurich will still be able to appeal this order at the end of the coverage case 
in  the trial court made another summary adjudication ruling that zurich must indemnify and pay watts and james jones for the million paid to settle the claims of the phase i cities described above 
zurich s attempt to obtain appellate review of this ruling was denied on december  by the california court of appeal  but zurich will still be able to appeal this order at the end of the coverage case 
although zurich has been making payments required by these indemnity orders  we are currently unable to predict the finality of these orders since zurich can appeal them at the end of the coverage case 
we have recorded reimbursed indemnity settlement amounts but not reimbursed defense costs as a liability pending court resolution of the indemnification matter as it relates to zurich 
zurich has asserted that all amounts now approximately million for both defense costs and indemnity amounts paid for settlements paid by it to us and james jones are subject to reimbursement under deductible agreements related to the insurance policies between zurich and watts 
if zurich were to prevail on this argument  james jones would have a possible indemnity claim against us for its exposure from the armenta case 
however  management and counsel anticipate that we will ultimately prevail on this reimbursement issue with zurich 
based on management s assessment  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of the james jones litigation will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
while this assessment is based on all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain  the actual liability to us to resolve this litigation fully cannot be predicted with any certainty and there exists a reasonable possibility that we may ultimately incur losses in the james jones litigation in excess of the amount accrued 
we intend to continue to contest vigorously all aspects of the james jones litigation 
environmental remediation we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to a limited number of identified contaminated sites  including a site in babylon  new york 
the levels of contamination vary significantly from site to site as do the related levels of remediation efforts 
environmental liabilities are recorded based on the most probable cost  if known  or on the estimated minimum cost of remediation 
we accrue estimated environmental liabilities based on assumptions  which are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties 
circumstances which can affect the reliability and precision of these estimates include identification of additional sites  environmental regulations  level of cleanup required  technologies available  number and financial condition of other contributors to remediation and the time period over which remediation may occur 
we recognize changes in estimates as new remediation requirements are defined or as new information becomes available 
we have a reserve of approximately million environmental accrual  which we estimate will likely be paid for environmental remediation liabilities over the next five to ten years 
based on the facts currently known to us  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
some of our environmental matters are inherently uncertain and there exists a possibility that we may ultimately incur losses from these matters in excess of the amount accrued 
however  we cannot currently estimate the amount of any such additional losses 
asbestos litigation we are defending approximately cases filed primarily  but not exclusively  in mississippi and new jersey state courts alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos 
these filings typically name multiple defendants and are filed on behalf of many plaintiffs 
they do not identify any particular watts products as a source of asbestos exposure 
to date  we have been dismissed from each case when the scheduled trial date comes near or when discovery fails to yield any evidence of exposure to any of our products 
based on the facts currently known to us  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
other litigation on or about march   a class action complaint was filed against us by north carolina hospitality group  inc in the circuit court of maryland  prince george s county 
it alleges that certain commercial valve models contain a design defect that causes them to fail prematurely 
on june   the trial court issued an opinion and order that denied the plaintiff s request for class certification 
this ruling was appealed at the end of the year  and it is now being briefed in the appellate court 
based on the facts currently known to us  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
other lawsuits and proceedings or claims  arising from the ordinary course of operations  are also pending or threatened against us 
based on the facts currently known to us  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other litigation matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and europe 
for years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation of water used in commercial  residential and light industrial applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include backflow preventers for preventing contamination of potable water caused by reverse flow within water supply lines and fire protection systems  a wide range of water pressure regulators for both commercial and residential applications  water supply and drainage products for commercial and residential applications  temperature and pressure relief valves for water heaters  boilers and associated systems  point of use water filtration and reverse osmosis systems for both commercial and residential applications  thermostatic mixing valves for tempering water in commercial and residential applications  and systems for under floor radiant applications and hydraulic pump groups for gas boiler manufacturers 
our business is reported in three geographic segments  north america  europe and china 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels  wholesale  do it yourself diy and original equipment manufacturers oems 
interest rates have an indirect effect on the demand for our products due to the effect such rates have on the number of new residential and commercial construction starts and remodeling projects 
non residential and commercial construction starts have an impact on our levels of sales and earnings 
in  organic sales in north america increased in both our wholesale and diy markets by approximately over the prior year 
also in  organic sales in europe increased by approximately over the prior year despite a weak european economy 
an additional factor that has had an effect on our sales is fluctuation in foreign currencies  as a portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  our consolidated sales increased over the prior year of which approximately was primarily due to the euro appreciating against the us dollar 
we believe that the factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water  increased demand for clean water and continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes and a healthy economic environment 
we have completed eighteen acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water safety  water conservation and water flow control 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry into new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the residential and commercial markets 
in  sales from acquisitions contributed approximately to our total sales growth over the prior period 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which represents a barrier to entry for competitors 
we believe there is an increasing demand among consumers for products to ensure water quality  which creates growth opportunities for our products 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic  and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
we have experienced increases in the costs of bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and crude oil 
the price of copper has risen approximately since december  bronze and brass are copper based alloys 
since december   we have experienced cost increases in bronze and brass of approximately and  respectively 
since december   we have experienced cost increases in cast iron and steel of and  respectively 
additionally  due to the increase in crude oil  the costs of our certain plastic resins increased approximately since december  a risk we face is our ability to deal effectively with increases in raw material costs 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary  implementing cost reduction programs and passing increases in costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally  on a limited basis  we use commodity futures contracts to manage this risk  although we do not currently have any such contracts 
in response to recent cost increases  we have implemented price increases for some of the products which have become more expensive to manufacture due to the increases in raw material costs 
as a result of these price increases we believe we have been successful in offsetting most  if not all  of the cost increases 
we are not able to predict whether or for how long these cost increases will continue 
if these cost increases continue and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases  our profit margins could decrease 
another risk we face in all areas of our business is competition 
we consider brand preference  engineering specifications  plumbing code requirements  price  technological expertise  delivery times and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors 
as mentioned previously  we believe that product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which represents a barrier to entry for competitors 
we are committed to maintaining our capital equipment at a level consistent with current technologies  and thus we spent approximately million in and million in we are committed to expanding our manufacturing capacity in lower cost countries such as china  tunisia and bulgaria 
these manufacturing plant relocations and consolidations are an important part of our ongoing commitment to reduce production costs 
recent developments on february   we declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s class a common stock and class b common stock 
this is an increase of per share compared to the dividend paid for the comparable period last year 
on january   we acquired hf scientific  inc located in fort myers  florida  in a stock purchase transaction  for approximately million in cash plus million in assumed debt 
hf scientific manufactures and distributes a line of instrumentation equipment  test kits and chemical reagents used for monitoring water quality in a variety of applications 
on january   we acquired sea tech  inc located in wilmington  north carolina in an asset purchase transaction  for approximately million in cash 
sea tech provides cost effective solutions for fluidic connection needs 
sea tech offers a wide range of standard and custom quick connect fittings  valves and manifolds and pex tubing designed to address specific customer requirements

prior periods reflect llc as discontinued operations 
we expect to divest our interest in llc in the first half of results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we identified and corrected errors related to certain accrued expenses

the impact of the amount that related to prior periods was not material to any of the financial statements of prior periods  thus the amount related to prior periods was also recorded in the fourth quarter of we estimate that we will record an additional after tax charge of approximately  or per share  for the nine months ending october  the following table illustrates the effects of the adjustments on earnings per share from continuing operations fourth quarter ended year ended december  december  adjustments related to related to earlier periods net sales

we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of our company because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as defined by gaap 
a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by continuing operations is provided below years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by continuing operations less additions to property  plant  and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment less dividends free cash flow our net debt to capitalization is not computed in accordance with gaap 
management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of net debt is provided below december  in thousands current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents net debt a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below december  in thousands net debt total stockholders equity plus minority interest capitalization we anticipate that available funds from current operations  existing cash  our revolving credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet current operating requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may have to consider external sources of financing for any large future acquisitions 
our long term contractual obligations as of december  are presented in the following table payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations  including current maturities a operating lease obligations capital lease obligations a earn out payout b pension contribution other c total a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet b includes  recognized in the consolidated balance sheet c includes commodity and capital expenditure commitments at december  we maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding were approximately  as of december  and  as of december  our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and to a lesser extent foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance 
the increase is primarily associated with insurance coverage 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down therefore  they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations

critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
there were no changes in accounting policies or significant changes in accounting estimates during we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with the audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record customer programs as an adjustment to net sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in north america  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves against financially troubled customers 
in addition  factors are developed utilizing historical trends in bad debts  returns and allowances 
the ratio of these factors to sales on a rolling twelve month basis is applied to total outstanding receivables net of accounts specifically identified to establish a reserve 
in europe  management develops their bad debt allowance through an aging analysis of all their accounts 
in china  where payment terms are generally extended  we reserve all accounts receivable in excess of one year from the invoice date and specifically reserve for identified uncollectible accounts receivable less than one year old 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the credit worthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs generally determined on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential losses experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas on january   and as a result we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fas we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
we perform our annual test for indications of goodwill impairment on the last day of our fiscal october  which was october for fiscal intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
in our larger  more complex acquisitions  the value assigned to intangible assets is determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
it has been three years since adoption of fas  and for all years our valuations have been greater than the carrying value of our goodwill and intangibles 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as future sales volume  selling price changes  material cost changes  cost savings programs and capital expenditures could significantly affect our valuations 
other changes that may affect our valuations include  but are not limited to product acceptances and regulatory approval 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the assets to their realizable value 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
for product liability cases in the us  management estimates expected settlement costs by utilizing loss reports provided by our third party administrators as well as developing internal historical trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
prior to  we used insurance carrier trend factors to determine our product liability reserves 
however  we determined circumstances inherent in those trends were not necessarily indicative of our own circumstances regarding our claims 
management believes the internal trend factors more accurately reflect final expected settlement costs 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management s estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as required by financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for contingencies fas  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve this litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
final settlement of these matters could possibly result in significant effects on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
employers accounting for pensions fas 
in applying fas  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
rates of increase in compensation levels this rate is used to estimate projected annual pay increases  which are used to determine the wage base used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in the above assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes including our best estimate of permanent items that will impact the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material discrepancies from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules of financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
certain factors affecting future results we face intense competition and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position  leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices  either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits 
we encounter intense competition in all areas of our business 
additionally  customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventories and their transaction costs 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  we anticipate that we may have to reduce the prices of some of our products to stay competitive  potentially resulting in a reduction in the profit margin for  and inventory valuation of  these products 
some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products which are priced in other currencies 
reductions or interruptions in the supply of raw materials and increases in the costs of raw materials could reduce our profit margins and adversely impact our ability to meet our customer delivery commitments 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
the availability and costs of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to  among other things  new laws or regulations  suppliers allocations to other purchasers  interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and worldwide price and demand levels 
we are not currently party to any long term supply agreements 
our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable costs  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
the costs of these raw materials are at the highest levels that they have been in many years 
we may continue to experience further cost increases of these materials 
if we are not able to continue to reduce or eliminate the effect of these cost increases through lowering other costs of production or successfully implementing price increases to our customers  such cost increases from our vendors could have a negative effect on our financial results 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or our profitability 
one of our strategies is to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary water related products and increase market share for our existing product lines 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  companies acquired recently and in the future may not achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we have faced increasing competition for acquisition candidates which have resulted in significant increases in the purchase prices of many acquisition candidates 
this competition  and the resulting purchase price increases  may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us  possibly leading to a decrease in the rate of growth of our revenues and profitability 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including  but not limited to adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  and unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
down economic cycles  particularly reduced levels of residential and non residential starts and remodeling  could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
the businesses of most of our customers  particularly plumbing and heating wholesalers and home improvement retailers  are cyclical 
therefore  the level of our business activity has been cyclical  fluctuating with economic cycles 
we also believe our level of business activity is influenced by residential and non residential starts and renovation and remodeling  which are  in turn  heavily influenced by interest rates  consumer debt levels  changes in disposable income  employment growth and consumer confidence 
if these and other factors cause a material reduction in residential and non residential and remodeling starts  our revenues and profits would decrease and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results 
since we sell and manufacture our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  which could increase our costs of doing business internationally  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  which could have an adverse impact on our profits  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  which could reduce our productivity  costs of compliance with differing labor regulations  especially in connection with restructuring our overseas operations  laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  which may be costly and require time to implement 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  particularly the euro  could materially affect our reported results 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies  as a portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
approximately of our sales during the year ended december  were from sales outside of the us compared to for the year ended december  for the years ended december   and  the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar had a positive impact on sales of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  our canadian operations require significant amounts of us purchases for their operations 
if our share of revenue in non dollar denominated currencies continues to increase in future periods  exchange rate fluctuations will likely have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
further  the chinese government may cease its utilization of a fixed rate of exchange of the chinese rmb against the us dollar which could adversely affect our current favorable cost structure for goods we source from our joint ventures  our wholly owned subsidiary in china and our outside vendors 
there are risks in expanding our manufacturing operations in china 
as part of our strategy  we are shifting a portion of our manufacturing operations to china to reduce our production costs and sell product into the chinese market 
this shift will subject a greater portion of our operations to the risks of doing business in china 
the increased production levels in china require increased levels of working capital as we are rapidly increasing headcount and manufacturing equipment 
if we are unable to quickly train these new employees we may experience product quality issues 
the chinese central and local government authorities have a high degree of control over our business in china than is customary in developed economies and makes the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approval in china inherently unpredictable 
in addition  the protection accorded our proprietary technology and know how under the chinese legal system is not as strong as in the united states and  as a result  we may lose valuable trade secrets and competitive advantage 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher utilization levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the equipment and management systems necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities may break down  perform poorly or fail  resulting in fluctuations in our ability to manufacture our products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities  all of which are subject to this risk  and such fluctuations at any of these facilities could cause an increase in our production costs and a corresponding decrease in our profitability 
we also have a vertically integrated manufacturing process 
each segment is dependent upon the prior process and any breakdown in one segment will adversely affect all later components 
fluctuations in our production process may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our inability to meet our delivery obligations could result in a loss of our customers and negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our manufacturing restructuring plan  which we began in  was initiated to reduce our manufacturing costs 
as we transition more of our operations overseas  as a result of the manufacturing restructuring plan  we are transferring capacity utilization 
if our planned manufacturing plant consolidations in the united states and europe and our production capability expansion in china are not successful  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance and regulatory approvals  our revenues and our profitability may decrease 
our failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  changes in specifications required by our customers  plumbing codes and or regulatory agencies  technically complex products  and constant improvement to existing products and introductions of new products 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands and the requirements of plumbing codes and or regulatory agencies 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of experienced engineers  that could delay or prevent our development  introduction  approval or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
such difficulties could cause us to lose business from our customers and could adversely affect our competitive position  in addition  added expenses could decrease the profitability associated with those products that do not gain market acceptance 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and disposal and workplace safety 
such laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
we could also be liable for the costs of property damage or personal injury to others 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
under certain environmental laws  the current and past owners or operators of real property may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination  even if they did not know of or were not responsible for such contamination 
these laws also impose liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste at any site 
therefore  our ownership and operation of real property and our disposal of waste could lead to liabilities under these laws 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  costs relating to these environmental matters 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur additional costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be significant 
environmental litigation  enforcement and compliance are inherently uncertain and we may experience significant costs in connection with environmental matters 
for more information  see part i  item  business product liability  environmental  and other litigation matters 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may expend resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we have been limited from selling products from time to time because of existing patents 
we face risks from product liability and other lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business 
we have been and may continue to be subject to various product liability claims or other lawsuits  including  among others that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  damages from these claims would have to be paid from our assets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in particular  if we settle or conclude litigation in a quarterly or annual reporting period  there could be a material impact on our operating results for that quarter or year 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and other lawsuits in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have product liability and general insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
for more information  see part i  item  business product liability  environmental  and other litigation matters 
the requirements of fas may result in a write off of all or a portion of our goodwill  which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
as of december   we had goodwill of million  or of our total assets and of our total stockholders equity 
if we are required to take an impairment charge to our goodwill in connection with the requirements of fas  our operating results may decrease and our financial condition may be harmed 
under fas  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill and are required to perform annual impairment reviews thereafter 
we have concluded that no impairment existed at october   the time of our annual review 
we perform our annual test for indications of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or sooner if indicators exist 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our largest customer  the home depot  inc  accounted for approximately million  or  of our total net sales for the year ended december   and million  or  of our total net sales for year ended december  our customers generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and are able to terminate their relationships with us at any time 
a significant reduction in orders or change in terms from the home depot  inc could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
certain indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments 
our revolving credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  our creditors could declare a default under our revolving credit facility and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our indebtedness may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
one of our stockholders can exercise substantial influence over our company 
as of january   timothy p 
horne  a member of our board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of class a common stock assuming conversion of all shares of class b common stock beneficially owned by mr 
horne into class a common stock and approximately of our outstanding shares of class b common stock  which represents approximately of the total outstanding voting power 
as long as mr 
horne controls shares representing at least a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding stock  mr 
horne will be able to unilaterally determine the outcome of all stockholder votes and other stockholders will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
conversion and sale of a significant number of shares of our class b common stock could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
as of january  there were outstanding  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock 
shares of our class b common stock may be converted into class a common stock at any time on a one for one basis 
all of the shares of class a common stock are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws  except for any shares held by our affiliates  sales of which will be limited by rule under the securities act 
in addition  under the terms of a registration rights agreement with respect to outstanding shares of our class b common stock  the holders of our class b common stock have rights with respect to the registration of the underlying class a common stock 
under these registration rights  the holders of class b common stock may require  on up to two occasions  that we register their shares for public resale 
if we are eligible to use form s or a similar short form registration statement  the holders of class b common stock may require that we register their shares for public resale up to two times per year 
if we elect to register any shares of class a common stock for any public offering  the holders of class b common stock are entitled to include shares of class a common stock into which such shares of class b common stock may be converted in such registration 
however  we may reduce the number of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions 
we will pay all expenses in connection with any registration  other than underwriting discounts and commissions 
if all of the available registered shares are sold into the public market the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 
our class a common stock has insignificant voting power 
our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes for each share and our class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share 
as of january   our class b common stock constituted of our total outstanding common stock and of the total outstanding voting power and thus is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions fas 
the amendments made by fas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance

the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance 
the provisions of this statement shall be applied prospectively 
we do not expect that the impact of this statement will be material to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese rmb 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income for the change in the fair value of the contracts in our canadian operations were immaterial for and we have historically had a very low exposure on the cost of our debt to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt instruments and reduce interest expense on certain fixed rate instruments 
interest rate market risk for our interest rate swap was immaterial for and information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod  cast iron  steel and plastic  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally  on a limited basis  we use commodity futures contracts to manage this risk  but we did not use such contracts in or
