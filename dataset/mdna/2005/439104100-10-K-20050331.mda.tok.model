item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview hooper holmes  inc and its subsidiaries currently engage in two principal businesses  which are operated as distinct business divisions our health information division  which we formerly referred to as the health information business unit or hibu  is one of the leading providers of outsourced risk assessment services to the life and health insurance industry 
the risk assessment services that we provide include our portamedic business  which involves the arranging of paramedical and medical examinations including blood and urine specimen collection  primarily in connection with insurance carriers processing and evaluation of the risks associated with underwriting insurance policies mainly life insurance policies  under the infolink name  tele underwriting  telephone personal health interviews and medical records retrieval  and through our wholly owned subsidiary  heritage labs  the processing of specimens obtained in connection with our paramedical examinations  as well as the specimens provided by third party health information service providers 
this collective information assists the insurance carriers in evaluating mortality and morbidity risks of the applicants they process 
our claims evaluation division  which we formerly referred to as the diversified business unit  provides medical claims services to insurance adjusters for use in processing accident claims  primarily on behalf of property and casualty insurance carriers 
the core activity of this business consists of arranging for independent medical exams imes for the purpose of determining the nature  source and extent of injury 
over the course of its year history  the company has had diversified businesses  but since the sale of a segment in  until the establishment of our claims evaluation division in  our sole business has been that conducted by the health information division 
in august  we determined to expand that business geographically by acquiring medicals direct group  a company based in the united kingdom that provides paramedical examinations referred to as screenings in the uk and underwriting services to the life insurance industry  medical services through company operated clinics  and medical reports to the legal profession 
this acquisition afforded us the opportunity to enter the uk insurance market and potentially expand into insurance markets throughout europe  though our preliminary research suggests that the life insurance markets in europe are in a very early stage of formation relative to what such markets may need by way of medical underwriting services 
in  we enhanced our presence in the united kingdom through medicals direct group s acquisition of three complementary companies  which increased its market share in 
table of contents the united kingdom and enhanced its screenings and general medicals businesses 
in  medicals direct completed two additional acquisitions to expand its services being provided to the legal profession 
the aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions  including acquisition costs  was million 
the acquisition of medicals direct group represented our first entry into the outsourced underwriting services business  a key component of our growth strategy 
in may  we took another step to implement this strategy by acquiring mid america agency services  inc maas  a full service insurance services organization based in omaha  nebraska  that provides risk selection services to the insurance underwriting industry 
the purchase price associated with the maas acquisition  including acquisition costs  was million 
our claims evaluation division is the result of our implementation of a plan  formulated in and  to diversify into a second major segment of business  in part to address what our management anticipated would be a continued worsening of the market conditions affecting our health information division 
see the discussion under key trends affecting our operating results below 
in october  we made the first of four acquisitions in the automobile no fault and workers compensation industries by acquiring d d associates 
d d is a new york based ime company which provides medical claims case management services primarily to property and casualty insurance companies in the new york city metropolitan area 
the d d acquisition represented our initial entry into the ime market  and furthered our strategy of acquiring businesses that complemented our existing health information business 
in october  we acquired medimax  inc  a provider of imes and functional capacity evaluations for workers compensation  disability and no fault customers  primarily in pennsylvania and new jersey 
in january  we acquired allegiance health inc  a provider of imes  peer reviews and closely related services to the automobile no fault insurance market in new york  and imes in connection with workers compensation claims in new york 
in may  we acquired michigan evaluation group  which provides imes in michigan to workers compensation and no fault auto claims handlers 
the aggregate purchase price of these and acquisitions  including acquisition costs  was approximately million 
in  our health information division generated of our revenue and of our operating profit 
however  our claims evaluation division has made an increased contribution to our revenues over the last three fiscal years  as reflected by the table below segment revenue for the year ended december  s health information division claims evaluation division total key trends affecting our operating results the following represent the key trends affecting the operating results of our health information division decline in life insurance applications life insurance application activity has declined over the past several years 
our health information division has monitored this trend  primarily by tracking the reporting by the medical information bureau group  inc mib of applicant activity on all types of policies of life insurance 
for the past two years  the number of applications for life insurance recorded by mib has declined by in and in although the mib data reflect applications for policies that  based on policy size and or applicant age  may not involve a 
table of contents medical underwriting process and  as a result  represent less than a perfect benchmark  our management is of the view that there is a strong correlation between the data and the operating results of our health information division 
our management attributes the decline in life insurance application activity to a number of factors  including the drop off in insurance agents selling life insurance  the lower percentage of americans with individual life insurance policies  and product changes in the life insurance industry 
cost pressure from life insurance carriers and our competition in view of the general economic conditions and the modest investment returns achieved by insurance companies over the past several years  carriers have had to address cost items in a more rigorous manner in an attempt to maintain their profitability and level of return to their stakeholders 
this has resulted in increased cost pressure on outsourced service providers 
in addition to the cost pressure from the insurance industry itself  some of the health information division s primary competitors have also contributed to the downward pressure on the prices of the division s services  particularly its portamedic paramedical examination services 
the four major paramedical industry companies have created an extremely competitive environment  with price surpassing quality and timeliness of service as the primary reason why insurance carriers select a paramedical examination provider 
changes in the channels through which life insurance is sold in view of the drop off in the writing of life insurance policies  insurance carriers have adopted a multi channel strategy  then sought to optimize the productivity of each channel 
sales through local sales agents brokers have declined dramatically 
the alternative distribution channel consisting of direct mail  the internet and services that provide insurance pricing online now represents the fastest growing segment of the market 
we estimate that approximately of our health information division s revenues in were generated from the alternative distribution channel 
the following represent the key trends affecting the operating results of our claims evaluation division contraction of the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states management perceives that the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states  including the market for the claims evaluation division s medical evaluative services  may be contracting 
a number of factors may be contributing to this trend  including the long term decline in the number of people hurt in automobile accidents in the united states and the shifting of manufacturing activity to areas outside the nation s borders which may be reducing the number of workers compensation claims 
property and casualty insurance is largely regulated on a state  not federal level  with most of the demand for medical claims management services being affected by state insurance laws  which are subject to frequent change change that can impact the claims evaluation division s business quickly 
in the last few years  a number of states have adopted legislation encouraging the use of managed care techniques in handling workers compensation claims in an effort to control their workers compensation costs 
managed care laws generally provide employers an opportunity to channel injured employees into provider networks  and suggest treatment protocols and other constraints on the activity of such providers 
these laws could result in a re assessment of the usefulness of imes in the evaluation of the need for further medical treatment 

table of contents continued importance of physician independence the nature of the claims evaluation division s business the core of which is the arranging of imes is such that the independence of the independent medical examinations has been  and remains  of paramount importance 
the companies that comprise the division must be ever vigilant regarding the level of independence of the division s physician panel  monitoring the amount of work directed to any particular physician 
further  the division s quality reviewers must ensure that the ime reports we arrange on behalf of our customers are comprehensive and complete  and that the factual results support the conclusions drawn in such reports 
heightened compliance and security standards federal laws regarding financial controls and accountability eg  the sarbanes oxley act of  the privacy and security of medical records hipaa and consumer personal financial information gramm leach bliley have resulted in stricter compliance standards that insurers  third party administrators of claims  and other claims handlers and  as a consequence  their vendors must meet 
we are being asked to complete lengthy questionnaires  provide written representations as to our compliance with such laws  and meet more rigorous standards regarding the quality of our services 
enhanced physician credentialing  including the undertaking of criminal background checks of such physicians  is a particularly costly demand being made by certain claims handlers 
in addition  our customers are seeking confirmation that we have sufficient financial resources to sustain legal challenges to our compliance with these laws 
alternative methods of reducing medical over treatment and fraud can impact the demand for our services in new york state  one of our core markets  the state government within the last two years increased its prosecutions of automobile insurance fraud  including alleged fraud conducted in part by healthcare practitioners 
separately  new york insurance regulators also took steps to reduce the timeframes that injured parties had for submitting no fault automobile insurance claims and medical bills to the carriers 
as a result of these two actions  there has been a reduction in the number of excessive or fraudulent medical bills handled by our clients 
this reduction has led to a reduction in the number of ime and peer review services that our clients order in new york 

table of contents results of operations explanation of statement of income line items the table below sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  in millions revenue cost of operations gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses loss on investment operating income interest expense interest income other expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income analysis of comparative operating results revenues our consolidated revenues increased in each of the last two fiscal years 
consolidated revenues of million in were higher than in consolidated revenues of million in were higher than in as explained in the discussion below with respect to each of our two divisions  acquisition activity over the last few years largely fueled the growth in our revenues 
health information division 
our health information division s revenues amounted to million  an increase of over the revenues of million 
the health information division s revenues were up over revenues of million 
portamedic 
the increases in the health information division s revenues in and were achieved despite the decline in revenues from our core portamedic business in each of these years  such decline reflecting the reduction in the number of life insurance applications initiated in the united states  based on data available through the medical information bureau group  inc mib 
the number of paramedical examinations we performed in amounted to  units  compared to  units in and  in the figures reflect a decline of approximately in compared to  and in compared to the year over year percentage drop off in our paramedical examination units in each of and  when compared to the and declines based on the mib data in application activity in and  respectively  are suggestive of our loss of market share 
in that regard  the health information division s management is aware of the loss of two customers during a decline in revenues of million from 
table of contents to as a matter of determining not to compete at the price points being offered by competitors 
in  we lost the approvals of several carrier clients  primarily due to price 
these lost clients accounted for approximately half of the total paramedical examination unit change in compared to the prior year 
in addition to the decline in the number of paramedical examination units over each of the past two years  our average revenue per examination in of reflects a decline of compared to the prior year 
the decrease is reflective of the greater discounting of prices in the division s risk assessment services market in response to pressure from the insurance industry and competitive pressure 
we believe that this reduction is reflective of the continuing trend in the paramedical industry  in which price has become the primary driver in insurance companies selection process 
infolink 
the declines in portamedic revenues in each of the last two years were partially offset by increases in infolink revenues  by in compared to ie  million in compared to million in  and by in compared to ie  million in compared to million in 
the number of infolink reports increased in each of the last two years  from  in  to  in  and  in our average revenue per infolink report went from in  to in  and in our management attributes the growth in infolink revenues to the success of our centralized call center in kansas city  kansas  which we opened in mid during  we were awarded several contracts to handle certain clients tele interviews  and in early we have signed an additional two clients 
our management believes that by securing a carrier s infolink business we may be able to secure its paramedical and attending physician statement aps business  as well 
our internet driven business units received via the internet remains an important part of our overall business and has grown for the year  over  despite the overall market softness 
the internet units were flat in the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter a year ago 
this portion of our business is largely a sub set of the portamedic business reported above and therefore their metrics apply 
medicals direct group 
medicals direct group realized significant revenue growth in each of and its revenues in were million  compared to million in and million in the four month period it was part of our consolidated results in the increase in was attributable to a number of factors  including the inclusion for a full year in of the operating results of a screenings business medicals direct group acquired in october  which accounted for million of the increase  the addition of several new insurance company clients for medicals direct group s outsourced underwriting services 
during  medicals direct group opened two new underwriting offices and added to its staff of underwriting auditors to perform quality control reviews 
our management believes that the high quality of its outsourced underwriting services continues to fuel the growth in medicals direct group s outsourced underwriting business 
continued growth in the number of screenings  reflecting the increased life insurance application activity in the united kingdom  growth  organically and through two acquisitions  in medicals direct group s business with law firms referred to as medico legal  the acquisitions contributing approximately million in revenues in  growth in medicals direct group s clinics business  mainly attributable to the more effective utilization 
table of contents of the clinic facilities and staff by other companies within the medicals direct group  particularly its screenings business 
utilization of staff and facilities is a main focus of the clinics business  since staffing and facility costs are relatively fixed  and an increase in the pound sterling us dollar exchange rate creating an impact of approximately million 
other services 
the other services component of our health information division which includes maas and heritage labs businesses also experienced revenue growth in each of and revenues in were million  an increase of million approximately compared to the prior year 
revenues in of million were million higher than the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase in was the may acquisition of mid america agency services  inc maas  which contributed revenues of million in maas  like medicals direct group  performs outsourced underwriting services to the life insurance industry 
in  we hope to leverage the industry expertise at maas to attract new customers and grow this business 
heritage labs also contributed to the revenue growth 
heritage labs tested an increased number of specimens in   compared to  in and  in the average price per specimen tested increased in to  an increase of  after a decline of in the prior year 
management attributes the increase in specimens tested in to heritage lab s strategy  initiated in  to attract customers through offering attractive prices for short periods of time in order to attract new customers 
the strategy proved successful in fueling heritage labs revenue growth in despite the decrease in the average revenue per specimen tested in from  heritage labs maintained its gross margin by negotiating improved shipping rate discounts  obtaining volume discounts on material costs and by using contractor  rather than employee  labor 
claims evaluation division 
our claims evaluation division s revenues were million  an increase of over the corresponding amount in of million 
the revenue figure was million  reflective of the two month period in during which d d associates then the only business comprising this division was included in our consolidated results in the increase in the claims evaluation division s revenues in was primarily attributable to the revenue contributions million of allegiance health and michigan evaluation group  both of which were acquired in  and the revenue contribution of medimax acquired in october for a full year in offsetting the increase in the claims evaluation division s growth in revenues attributable to these acquisitions  was a decline in revenues of d d associates compared to the prior year of million 
d d associates operates primarily in the state of new york 
the decline in its revenues was attributable to several factors  including a decline in automobile claims activity in new york  which management believes is attributable to more conservative automobile insurance underwriting standards  regulatory changes requiring claimants and medical practitioners to notify insurers of potential no fault auto claims on a more timely basis  which has resulted in a decline in the number of claims that may be considered for an ime or peer review  increased enforcement of insurance fraud laws by the new york state insurance fraud bureau and special investigative units of insurance companies  which reduces such companies need for additional claims evaluation services  and 
table of contents increased competition from other service providers  which has apparently led insurers to more evenly distribute claims among vendors 
recognizing that the above factors have created structural changes in the new york market  the claims evaluation division intends to take a number of steps to address those changes  including more aggressively selling its services to claims handlers  with the focus being on the high quality of the services we provide  expanding organically into new service areas by leveraging the division s infrastructure and experienced staff  utilizing the division s updated web based platform  which will allow for higher quality and more timely services  and considering acquisitions in new markets to further the division s strategy for national growth 
in addition  the claims evaluation division experienced a reduction in the amount of business from one customer in following the customer s decision to lessen the concentration of its claims evaluation services being provided by the division 
cost of operations our total cost of operations amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in the table below shows cost of operations as a percentage of segment revenues during the last three years 
for the years ended december  in millions as of segment revenues as of segment revenues as of segment revenues hid portamedic infolink medicals direct other services total hid ced total health information division 
cost of operations for the health information division was million in  an increase of million compared to the figure of million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in medicals direct group s revenues in  as well as the may acquisition of maas 
the decline in portamedic s activities and revenues served to partially offset the increase in cost of operations 
in addition  the division was able to reduce its laboratory kit costs  increase the yields for certain tests by reformulating reagents used in the testing process  improve the efficiency of newly acquired testing equipment  and achieve more effective utilization of its employees as a result of improved scheduling of production runs 
the relatively small increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues in compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the higher relative amount of revenues contributed by infolink which has a lower gross margin than that of portamedic  higher branch operating expenses  and the increased revenues of medicals direct group particularly from its medico legal business  which historically has had higher direct and operating expenses 
cost of operations for the health information division in reflected an increase of million compared to the prior year figure of million 
the increase was primarily due to increases in revenues

cost of operations for the claims evaluation division in was million  reflecting the two month period during which d d associates was part of our consolidated results 
the increase in over the prior year was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues in resulting from the acquisitions of allegiance health  inc and michigan evaluation group  inc 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of the division s revenues in compared to the prior year reflected the higher operating costs of medimax acquired in and allegiance health compared to d d associates  which is able to leverage its operating expenses by virtue of its processing of a higher volume of imes

the examiner did not work for the company nor was the company aware that the examiner was performing insurance examinations 
the company has agreed to reimburse one of its insurance company clients  which it billed for examinations performed by this examiner  for certain legal  consulting and other costs incurred by the client  as well as a portion of any liability that may stem from examinations performed by the independent examiner 
the related costs and estimated liability are accrued at december  and to date  the company and its client have settled with four claimants and no claims are pending 
the company expects that the outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
on january   sylvia gayed  one of the company s examiners in california  filed a lawsuit against the company in the superior court of california  los angeles county  alleging violations of california s wage and hour laws 
the complaint alleges that the company failed to pay overtime wages  provide meal and rest periods and reimbursement for expenses incurred in performing examinations 
the plaintiff is attempting to have the lawsuit certified as a class action on behalf of other examiners who perform similar work for the company in california 
we currently employ examiners in california and have employed in excess of  examiners in california over the past months 
the company believes that it has properly paid its california examiners for overtime worked and intends to provide a vigorous defense to this litigation 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit 
in the past  some state agencies have claimed that we improperly classified our examiners as independent contractors for purposes of state unemployment tax laws and that we were therefore liable for taxes in arrears  or for penalties for failure to comply with their interpretation of the laws 
we received an adverse determination in the state of california  and as a result  converted our independent contractors to employees 
other similar state claims are also pending 
there are no assurances that we will prevail in these cases  or that we will not be subject to similar claims in other states in the future 
on july   the company received a determination from the internal revenue service that one individual the company contracted with as an independent contractor  should have been classified as an employee in this ruling also applies to any other individuals engaged by the company under similar circumstances 
the ruling stated that the company may not be subject to adverse consequences as the company may be entitled to relief under applicable tax laws section of the revenue act of 
management believes that the company qualifies for relief under section to date  the company has not received any further communication from the internal revenue service and considers the matter closed 

table of contents the company is a party to a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business 
in the opinion of management  the company  has substantial legal defenses and or insurance coverage with respect to all of its pending legal actions 
accordingly  none of these actions is expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  its consolidated results of operations or its consolidated financial position 
inflation inflation has not had  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition our health information division recognizes revenues for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
the claims evaluation division recognizes revenue when the independent medical exam  peer review or similar services are completed 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management continuously assesses the financial condition of our customers and the markets in which these customers participate and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this periodic review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
table of contents significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  impairments are recognized when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying value 
we generally measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december  intangible assets are being amortized over the following weighted average useful lives non competition agreements years  customer base years  contractor network years  and trademarks and tradenames years 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if we were to establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income

risk factors risks related to our health information division our core business activity  our portamedic business  has been characterized by declining revenues and margins for the past several years 
over the past several years  our core portamedic business has experienced a decline in revenues and margins 
the most critical and indicative non financial metric of relevance to this business is the number of applications for life insurance 
for the past two years  data provided by the medical information bureau group  inc mib indicate that the number of applications has declined by in and in for an explanation of factors that our management believes underlie this decline  see item business health information division key trends of relevance to the health information division decrease in life insurance applications issuance of life insurance policies 
in addition  our average revenue per paramedical examination has also declined during this time  reflecting the cost pressures from both our insurance company customers and our competition 
although we have had some success with a number of steps taken to retain market share in this 
table of contents business  and to diversify our operations  if we are not able to reverse the decline in our operating results relating to our portamedic business we will have increased difficulty growing our business  responding to the competitive forces in our industries and financing our further expansion plans 
if our health information division is unable to lower its cost structure  our competitiveness and operating results may decline 
our health information division is facing increased cost pressure from its insurance company customers  the result of the more modest investment returns such carriers have achieved in recent years 
in addition to the cost pressure from the insurance industry itself  some of the health information division s primary competitors have also contributed to the downward pressure on the prices of the division s services  particularly our portamedic paramedical examination services 
the four major paramedical industry companies have created an extremely competitive environment  with price surpassing quality and timeliness of service as the primary reason why insurance carriers select a paramedical examination provider 
our strategic focus over the past few years has been to provide faster  more efficient service as a competitive differentiator 
with price having become the primary basis of competition and with the increased use of the internet and the electronic delivery of orders for our services  it may be that the health information division s extensive network of branch and contract affiliate offices results in our having a cost structure that is higher than some of our competitors 
our management is aware of the loss of two customers in as a matter of the division determining not to compete at the price points being offered by competitors 
further  in we lost the approvals of several carrier clients  primarily due to price 
if we do not continue our initiatives to lower our costs to address the current market conditions including the continuing decline in life insurance application activity  our competitiveness and  thus  our operating results may decline 
heritage labs failure to provide accurate laboratory test results may result in claims against us 
the health information division heritage labs business processes the blood and urine specimens obtained in connection with a portion of our paramedical examinations  as well as the specimens provided by third party health information service providers 
our insurance company clients and these third party health information service providers rely on the accuracy of the test results and other data in connection with their insurance underwriting  treatment and other decisions 
in addition  federal and state laws regulate the disclosure of specimen test results and other nonpublic medical related personal information 
if heritage labs does not provide accurate test results or does not protect the confidentiality of such results in accordance with such laws  we could face significant liability 
our health information division is exposed to possible litigation and legal liability relating to our classification of most of our paramedical examiners as independent contractors rather than employees 
we classify most of our paramedical examiners as independent contractors rather than employees  making such examiners personally responsible for their employment taxes and workers compensation 
in the past  some state agencies have claimed that we improperly classified our examiners as independent contractors for purposes of state unemployment tax laws and that we were therefore liable for arrears of taxes or for penalties for failure to comply with these laws 
in the state of california  we received an adverse determination as to the independent contractor status of our paramedical examiners  and  as a result  we now classify our examiners in california as employees 
the uncertainty regarding how other jurisdictions in which we conduct operations may resolve the issue of whether our paramedical examiners are independent contractors or employees results in our exposure to potential litigation and liability  as well as the possibility of increased operating costs should any of such jurisdictions determine that our examiners are employees 

table of contents risks related to our claims evaluation division there are signs that the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states may be contracting  which may limit the potential growth of our claims evaluation division s business 
our management perceives that the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states  including the market for our claims evaluation division s medical evaluative services  may be contracting 
a number of factors may be contributing to this perceived trend  such as the decline in the number of people hurt in automobile accidents in the united states  the shifting of manufacturing activity to areas outside the nation s borders  and changing laws and regulations affecting the property and casualty insurance industry 
for more information  see item business claims evaluation division key trends of relevance to the claims evaluation division contraction of the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states 
if this trend continues  the growth potential of our claims evaluation division s business may be adversely affected 
further  the division may be at a competitive disadvantage in dealing with a contracting market as a result of the more narrow focus of its present business activities relative to competitors that are engaged in the other segments of the outsourced medical claims management market ie  medical claims audit and medical management services 
our claims evaluation division has a significant degree of customer concentration  such that the loss of any one of its larger customers would have a material effect on its operating results 
the business activities of our claims evaluation division  which is comprised of the four companies within the division that have been acquired since october  remains significantly focused in the geographic regions in which these companies were originally active ie  new york  pennsylvania  new jersey and michigan  with the division s largest clients accounting for of the division s revenues in the loss of any of these customers would likely result in a drop off in the claims evaluation division s revenues and profitability  and that drop off may be material 
a primary component of our claims evaluation division s growth strategy is to increase its national capabilities as a provider of independent medical examination related services  which entails a number of challenges and risks 
a primary component of our claims evaluation division s growth strategy is to deepen its national capabilities as a provider of ime related services 
to implement this strategy will require the division s taking several steps  including substantially expanding its present panel of physicians  developing an enhanced  more robust shared information technology it platform and improving the scalability of the present it infrastructure  enhancing the division s practitioner credentialing  creating regional operations centers  and enhancing the division s sales and marketing capabilities 
for more information  see item business claims evaluation division the claims evaluation division s growth strategy deepen national capabilities as a provide of ime related services 
in addition to the capital expenditures associated with moving ahead with this component of the division s growth strategy  this initiative exposes us to a number of potential risks  including possible increases in costs and reduced profitability particularly in the short term as the division moves into new geographic regions and businesses  as well as the risks attendant to managing what may be rapid growth eg  possibly alienating institutional clients as the division adapts to new state regulatory regimes and establishes relationships with new panel physicians 

table of contents our claims evaluation division operates in a market that is characterized  and can be significantly affected  by changes in applicable state laws and regulations 
property and casualty insurance is largely regulated on a state level  with most of the demand for medical claims management services being created by state insurance laws 
these state regulatory regimes frequently change 
these changes may create a lesser demand for some or all of the division s services or require us to develop new or modified services in order to meet the needs of our customers and to compete effectively 
for example  in  the insurance department of the state of new york modified its regulations that govern the notification of accident claims and the submission of medical bills under its no fault automobile law in a manner that has reduced the demand for peer reviews  one of the division s services  in the state of new york 
for more information  see item business claims evaluation division government regulation 
our claims evaluation division s business is being affected by heightened federal laws and regulations that are increasing operating costs 
the claims evaluation division s business is being affected by heightened compliance and security standards being imposed at the federal level within the united states  such as the sarbanes oxley act of  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the gramm leach bliley act of as a vendor to the property and casualty insurance industry  the division is being asked to complete lengthy questionnaires  to provide written representations as to our compliance with such laws  and to meet more rigorous standards regarding the quality of our services 
enhanced physician practitioner credentialing  including the undertaking of criminal background checks of such practitioners  is a particularly costly demand being made by certain claims handlers 
in addition  certain of the division s customers are seeking confirmation that we have sufficient financial resources to sustain legal challenges to our compliance with these laws 
compliance with these demands will likely entail higher operating costs  which  combined with what our management perceives to be an increased price sensitivity on the part of the division s clients  may mean reduced margins and profitability 
if any of the members of our physician panel were to be found to lack proper credentials or be determined to be less than independent  the damage to our reputation and business could be considerable 
the nature of the claims evaluation division s business is such that the proper credentialing and independence of each member of the division s panel of physicians that perform imes has been  and remains  of paramount importance 
although the division is in the process of enhancing its background checks with respect to its roughly  strong panel physicians  there remains an exposure to liability resulting from improper conduct during an examination encounter even with the most rigorous of credentialing processes 
the division must also be ever vigilant in monitoring the amount of work directed to any particular physician  taking into consideration not just the absolute amount of the fees paid to that physician for his or her services but also how those fees compare with the physician s income from other sources 
further  the division s quality reviewers must ensure that the ime reports we arrange on behalf of our customers are comprehensive and complete  and that the factual results support the conclusions drawn in such reports 
if any of the members of our physician panel were to be found to lack proper credentials  be determined to be less than independent and or to engage in improper conduct during the course of an ime  we would be exposed to potential claims and liability 
further  as this is an industry wide issue  we could also experience a significant drop off in the demand for ime related services even if the physician or physicians found to be lacking proper credentials or independence  or engaging in improper conduct  were not part of our physician panel 

table of contents risks relating to our company generally acquisitions or other investments present many risks  and we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals of any of our acquisitions or other investments 
as part of our business strategy  we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic investments that will complement our existing services and leverage our existing capabilities 
there is no guarantee that these activities will be profitable  or that we will continue to offset the decline in operating results of our portamedic business through these types of activities 
any such acquisition or other investment involves a number of risks  including we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy  or that we overpaid for the company or assets  or that economic conditions have changed  all of which may result in a future impairment charge  we may have difficulty integrating the operations including it systems and personnel of an acquired business and may have difficulty retaining its customers and or key personnel  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing diverse locations  and we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations 
an ill advised acquisition or other investment could hurt our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a significant acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time 
from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or other investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management s time from our business as well as significant out of pocket costs 
the consideration that we pay in connection with an acquisition or other investment could affect our financial condition 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions or other investments in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options or other rights  our then existing shareholders may experience dilution in their share ownership in our company and their earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions or other investments may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and restructuring charges 
they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
any of these factors may decrease our operating results and weaken our financial condition 
our pending change in our accounting treatment to expense stock options will negatively affect our operating results 
the financial accounting standards board has recently announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  effective during the quarter ending september  such stock option expensing will require the company to value its employee stock option grants pursuant to a binomial valuation formula  and then amortize that value against the company s reported earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options 
the company currently accounts for stock based awards to employees in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas when the company is required to expense employee stock options in the future  this change in accounting treatment will decrease the company s reported results of operations as the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against the company s reported earnings 
for an illustration of the effect of such a change on the company s recent results of operations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other acquisition intangibles reflected on our balance sheet could depress our stock price 
as of december   approximately million of our million in total assets reflected on our balance sheet consisted of goodwill and intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas  which we adopted as of january   goodwill is no longer amortized but is  instead  reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down in the event it is determined that the recorded value of our businesses is greater than their fair value 
if we were to determine in any future period that an impairment charge was appropriate  the magnitude of the non cash charge to our earnings might be material 
this could lead to a negative reaction on the part of investors and a decline in our share price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company does not invest in equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
the company s debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
the company mitigates this risk by investing in only high credit quality securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor
