item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
item business company overview we are a property and casualty insurance holding company  which offers through our subsidiaries workers compensation  integrated disability and  to a lesser extent  other standard lines of commercial insurance  primarily in the eastern part of the united states 
these products are written through the pma insurance group  our property and casualty insurance segment  which has been in operation since our run off operations include our prior reinsurance and excess and surplus lines operations 
additionally  we have a corporate and other segment  which primarily includes corporate expenses  including debt service 
at december   we had total assets of billion and shareholders equity of million 
our business profile changed significantly in and on november   we announced a third quarter pre tax charge of million to increase the loss reserves for our reinsurance business for prior accident years 
following this announcement  am best company  inc am best reduced the financial strength ratings of pma capital insurance company pmacic  our reinsurance subsidiary  and the pma insurance group companies  our primary insurance business  to b very good 
the b financial strength rating constrained the pma insurance group s ability to attract and retain business during as a result of the reserve charge and ratings change  on november   we announced our decision to cease writing reinsurance business and to run off our existing reinsurance business  previously known as pma re 
our run off operations remain a significant component of our financial position  representing of our consolidated assets as of december  we also decided to suspend payment of dividends on our class a common stock 
we achieved our most important goal for  the restoration of the pma insurance group s a excellent financial strength rating  on november  financial information in the tables that follow is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  unless otherwise indicated 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods financial information to conform to the presentation 
revenues  pre tax operating income loss and assets attributable to each of our operating segments and our corporate and other segment for the last three years are set forth in note in item of this form k 
our gross and net premiums written by segment were as follows dollar amounts in thousands gross net gross net gross net the pma insurance group run off operations corporate and other total property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies provide loss protection to insureds in exchange for premiums 
if earned premiums exceed the sum of losses and loss adjustment expenses which we refer to as lae  acquisition expenses  operating expenses and policyholders dividends  then underwriting profits are realized 
when earned premiums do not exceed the sum of these items  the result is an underwriting loss 

table of contents the combined ratio is a frequently used measure of property and casualty underwriting performance 
the combined ratio computed on a gaap basis is equal to losses and lae  plus acquisition expenses  operating expenses and policyholders dividends  where applicable  all divided by net premiums earned 
thus  a combined ratio of under reflects an underwriting profit 
combined ratios of the pma insurance group were  and for  and  respectively 
because time normally elapses between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claims and certain related expenses  we invest the available premiums 
underwriting results do not include investment income from these funds 
given the long tail nature of our liabilities  we believe that the operating ratios are also important in evaluating our business 
the operating ratio is the combined ratio less the net investment income ratio  which is net investment income divided by premiums earned 
the operating ratios of the pma insurance group were  and in  and  respectively 
a 
glossary of selected insurance terms used in this form k is included on pages to the pma insurance group background the pma insurance group emphasizes its traditional core business  workers compensation insurance and integrated disability 
we also provide a range of other commercial insurance products but generally only if they complement our workers compensation products  including commercial automobile and multi peril coverages  general liability and related services 
the pma insurance group focuses primarily on middle market and large accounts operating in our principal marketing territory concentrated in the eastern part of the united states 
approximately of this business was produced through independent agents and brokers in the pma insurance group competes on the basis of its ability to offer tailored workplace disability management solutions to its clients  its long term relationships with its agents and brokers  its localized service and its reputation as a high quality claims and risk control service provider 
the pma insurance group has the ability to handle multi state clients based in its operating territory but which have operations in other parts of the us by being authorized to do business in jurisdictions including puerto rico and the district of columbia for workers compensation  general liability and commercial automobile 
the pma insurance group intends to continue writing other lines of property and casualty insurance  but generally only if such writings are supported by its core workers compensation business 
the pma insurance group also provides integrated disability products  with accounts as of december  that generated approximately million in combined workers compensation and integrated disability written premiums in the pma insurance group s primary insurance subsidiaries pennsylvania manufacturers association insurance company  manufacturers alliance insurance company and pennsylvania manufacturers indemnity company will sometimes be referred to as the pooled companies because they share results under an intercompany pooling agreement

table of contents workers compensation insurance most states require employers to provide workers compensation benefits to their employees for injuries and occupational diseases arising out of employment  regardless of whether such injuries result from the employer s or the employee s negligence 
employers may insure their workers compensation obligations subject to state regulation or  subject to regulatory approval  self insure their liabilities 
workers compensation statutes require that a policy cover three types of benefits medical expenses  disability indemnity benefits and death benefits 
the amounts of disability and death benefits payable for various types of claims are set and limited by statute  but no maximum dollar limitation exists for medical benefits 
workers compensation benefits vary among states  and the insurance rates we charge to our customers are subject to differing forms of state regulation 
statutory direct workers compensation business written by jurisdiction was as follows dollar amounts in thousands pennsylvania new york new jersey florida maryland virginia north carolina georgia other total the pma insurance group has focused primarily on the jurisdictions in the table above based upon its knowledge of their workers compensation systems and its assessment of each state s respective business  economic  legal and regulatory climates 
we closely monitor and take into consideration rate adequacy  regulatory climate and economic conditions in each state in the underwriting process 
the pma insurance group employs similar analyses in determining whether and to what extent it will offer products in additional jurisdictions 
the pma insurance group is focused on expanding its premium base in territories that meet its underwriting standards 
we continue to benefit from writing business for insureds mainly operating in the pma insurance group s principal marketing territory but with some operations in other states 
during  premium writings were lower then in prior years  primarily reflecting the impact of the b am best financial strength rating between november and november prior to november  the pma insurance group had increased its writings of workers compensation premiums through focused marketing efforts in its principal marketing territories 
workers compensation insurers doing business in certain states are required to provide insurance for risks that are not otherwise written on a voluntary basis by the private market 
we refer to this business as residual market business 
typically  an insurer s share of this residual market business is assigned on a lag based on its market share in terms of direct premiums in the voluntary market 
this system exists in all of the pma insurance group s marketing jurisdictions  except pennsylvania  new york and maryland 
in these three states  separate governmental entities write all of the workers compensation residual market business 
in  the pma insurance group wrote million in premiums of residual market business  which constituted of its gross workers compensation premiums written 
based upon data for policy year reported by the national council on compensation insurance  the percentage of residual market business for the industry as a whole  in all states  was of direct workers compensation premiums written 
the pma insurance group offers a variety of workers compensation products to its customers 
rate sensitive products are essentially based on manual rates filed and approved by state insurance departments  while loss sensitive products are priced to a certain extent on the basis of the insured s loss experience during the policy period 
we have also developed and sold alternative market products  such as large deductible products and other programs 
table of contents and services to customers who agree to assume even greater exposure to loss than under more traditional loss sensitive products 
we decide which type of product to offer a customer based upon the customer s needs  an underwriting review and credit history 
the pma insurance group s voluntary workers compensation direct premiums written by product type were as follows rate sensitive products loss sensitive products alternative market products total rate sensitive products include fixed cost policies and dividend paying policies 
the premium charged on a fixed cost policy is essentially based upon the manual rates filed with and approved by the state insurance department and does not increase or decrease based upon the losses incurred during the policy period 
under policies that are subject to dividend plans  the customer may receive a dividend based upon loss experience during the policy period 
loss sensitive products enable us to adjust the amount of the insured s premiums after the policy period expires based  to a certain extent  upon the insured s actual losses incurred during the policy period 
these loss sensitive products are generally subject to less price regulation than rate sensitive products and reduce  but do not eliminate  risk to the insurer 
under these types of policies  claims professionals periodically evaluate the reserves on losses after the policy period expires to determine whether additional premium adjustments are required under the policy 
these policies are typically subject to adjustment for an average of five years after policy expiration 
we generally restrict loss sensitive products to accounts with minimum annual premiums in excess of  the pma insurance group offers a variety of alternative market products for larger accounts  including large deductible policies and off shore captive programs 
typically  we receive a lower up front premium for these types of alternative market product plans 
however  under this type of business  the insured retains a greater share of the underwriting risk than under rate sensitive or loss sensitive products  which reduces the potential for unfavorable claim activity on the accounts and encourages loss control on the part of the insured 
for example  under a large deductible policy  the customer is contractually obligated to pay its own losses up to the amount of the deductible for each occurrence  subject to an aggregate limit 
the deductibles under these policies generally range from  to million 
in addition to these products  we offer our clients certain workers compensation services such as claims administration  risk management and other services 
the pma insurance group has a product for group integrated occupational and non occupational disability coverages  named pma one 
pma one leverages what we consider to be one of the pma insurance group s most important core competencies managing employee disabilities 
pma one offers employers the benefits of coordinated workers compensation and disability administration  reduced costs  programs designed to encourage faster return to work and heightened employee productivity 
as of december   we had pma one clients  which generated approximately million of combined workers compensation and integrated disability written premiums in pma one clients include health care systems  educational institutions  manufacturers and financial institutions 
through the pma insurance group s workers compensation product offerings  we provide a comprehensive array of managed care services to control loss costs 
these include case review and intervention by disability management coordinators  all of whom are registered nurses 
this service is also provided for our integrated disability product 
these disability management coordinators employ an early intervention model to proactively manage medical treatment and length of disability in concert with the pma insurance group s claims professionals and the insured employer 
there are also case management nurses who manage more serious claims via on site visits with injured workers and medical providers 
these professionals are supplemented by a full time medical director  who 
table of contents assists in implementing programs to monitor the quality and medical necessity of recommended treatment and identifying peer experts for complex claims 
access to the first health network  a workers compensation preferred provider network  which includes doctors  hospitals  physical therapists  outpatient clinics and imaging centers 
utilization of the network generally results in reduced medical costs  in comparison to medical costs incurred when a claim is handled outside this network 
utilization of an automated medical bill review system to detect duplicate billings  unrelated charges and coding discrepancies 
complex bills are forwarded to our cost containment unit  which is staffed by registered nurses and other medical professionals  to resolve questions regarding causal relationship and appropriate utilization levels 
use of paradigm corporation for the medical management of certain catastrophic injuries 
paradigm adds a team of catastrophic case management experts to assist in achieving enhanced clinical and financial outcomes on these catastrophic injuries 
tmesys pharmacy benefit management program 
tmesys is the only cardless pharmacy program designed specifically for the workers compensation industry 
it includes access to a nationwide network of pharmacies  increased savings through volume pricing  on line drug utilization review and the ability to capture the first prescription within the program 
other commercial lines the pma insurance group writes other property and liability coverages for larger and middle market accounts that satisfy its underwriting standards 
see 
underwriting on page these coverages feature commercial automobile  commercial multi peril  general liability and umbrella business 
the pma insurance group offers these products  but generally only if they complement the core workers compensation business 
other products and services the pma insurance group offers rent a captive products for certain insureds and associations 
the purpose of a rent a captive program is to offer a customer an alternative method of managing its loss exposures by obtaining many of the benefits of a captive insurer without establishing and capitalizing its own captive  in effect  the insured is investing in a captive facility that we have already established 
under this arrangement  the client purchases an insurance policy from us and chooses a participation level 
we then cede a portion of the premium and loss exposures to either a bermuda or cayman based subsidiary 
the client participates in the loss and investment experience of the portion ceded to the bermuda or cayman based subsidiary through a dividend mechanism 
the client is responsible for any loss that may arise within its participation level  and this potential obligation is typically secured through a letter of credit or similar arrangement 
our principal sources of income from this rent a captive program are the premium revenue on the risk retained by us and captive management fees earned 
through pma management corp  the pma insurance group provides claims administration  risk management  loss prevention and related services primarily to self insureds under fee for service arrangements 
distribution the pma insurance group distributes its products through multiple channels  including national  regional and local brokers and agents  employee benefits brokers  and direct sales representatives 
the pma insurance group has contracts with independent agents and brokers 
the current distribution network generally consists of large regional agents and brokers  local agents  and national brokers that specialize in larger to middle market accounts that require the variety of workers compensation  commercial lines and alternative market products offered by the pma insurance group 
in  independent brokers and agents accounted for approximately of the pma insurance group s direct written premiums 
the top ten independent brokers and 
table of contents agents accounted for of the pma insurance group s direct written premiums  the largest of which accounted for of its direct written premiums 
we typically pay commissions to the agents and brokers on individual policies placed with us 
we have also entered into agreements with our agents and brokers under which they have the potential to earn additional commission based on specified contractual criteria  primarily related to premium growth and retention 
the new york attorney general and certain other state regulators have initiated investigations and commenced legal actions against certain brokers and other insurance companies concerning their compensation agreements and other practices 
various states insurance departments and attorneys general have also responded to recent publicity surrounding broker compensation practices by issuing inquiries and subpoenas to insurance companies and insurance producers domiciled or doing business in their states 
to date  we have received inquiries from the pennsylvania and north carolina insurance departments concerning our business relationships with brokers  as did most or all other insurance companies doing business in these jurisdictions 
we have responded fully to these inquiries and believe that our contractual relationships and business practices with agents and brokers are in compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations 
the outcome of these investigations into broker compensation and placement practices and the impact of any future regulatory changes governing agent and broker commissions is uncertain 
as of december   the pma insurance group employed direct sales representatives who are generally responsible for certain business located in pennsylvania and delaware 
these employees produced million in direct premiums written in the pma insurance group s underwriters review all business submissions before they are accepted 
the pma insurance group monitors several statistics with respect to its independent brokers and agents  including a complete profile of the broker agent  the number of years the broker agent has been associated with the pma insurance group  the percentage of the broker agent s business that is underwritten by the pma insurance group  the ranking of the pma insurance group within the broker agent s business and the profitability of the broker agent s business 
as of december   our field organization consisted of branch or satellite offices throughout the pma insurance group s principal marketing territory 
branch offices deliver a full range of services directly to customers located in their service territory  while satellite offices primarily offer risk control and claim adjustment services 
underwriting the pma insurance group s underwriters  in consultation with actuaries  determine the general type of business to be written using a number of criteria  including past performance  relative exposure to hazard  premium size  type of business and other indicators of potential loss 
specific types of business are referred to underwriting specialists and actuaries for individual pricing 
the underwriting team also establishes classes of business that the pma insurance group generally will not write  such as certain property exposures  certain hazardous products and activities  and certain environmental coverages 
because terrorism exclusions have never been permitted for workers compensation business  we refined our workers compensation underwriting guidelines after september  to manage the underwriting exposure from terrorism risks  including the review of aggregation of risks by geographic location  evacuation and security of buildings in which insured employees work  and the type of entities located in the vicinity of the prospective insured 
these refined procedures have not materially affected the pma insurance group s mix of business 
underwriters and risk control professionals in the field report functionally to the chief underwriting officer and locally to branch vice presidents who are accountable for territorial operating results 
underwriters also work with the field marketing force to identify business that meets prescribed underwriting standards and to develop specific strategies to write the desired business 
in performing this assessment  the field office professionals also consult with actuaries who have been assigned to the specific field office regarding loss trends and pricing and utilize actuarial loss rating models to assess the projected underwriting results of accounts 
a formal underwriting quality assurance program is also employed to ensure consistent adherence to underwriting standards and controls 

table of contents the pma insurance group also employs credit analysts 
these employees review the financial strength and stability of customers who utilize loss sensitive and alternative market products and specify the type and amount of collateral that customers must provide under these arrangements 
premium auditors perform audits to determine that premiums charged accurately reflect the actual exposure bases 
claims administration claims services are delivered to customers primarily through employees located in branch or satellite offices 
claims are assigned to claims professionals based on coverage and jurisdictional expertise 
claims meeting certain criteria are referred to line of business claim specialists 
certain claims arising outside of our principal marketing territory are assigned to an independent claims service provider 
a formal quality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims adjustment activities 
claims professionals are also supported by a network of in house legal counsel and an anti fraud investigative unit 
a special claims unit in the home office manages more complex specialized matters such as asbestos and environmental claims 
the pma insurance group maintains a centralized claims processing center in order to minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive administrative demands on our claims professionals 
the center s ability to handle loss reports  perform claim set up  issue payments and conduct statutory reporting allows the claims professionals to focus on immediate contact and timely  effective claim resolution 
pma s customer service center also houses a centralized call center providing hour coverage for customer requests and inquiries 
currently  approximately of new losses are reported electronically through our internet based technology  including cinch  our internet risk management information technology 
competition the domestic property and casualty insurance industry is very competitive and consists of many companies  with no one company dominating the market for all products 
in addition  the degree and nature of competition varies from state to state for a variety of reasons  including the regulatory climate and other market participants in each state 
in addition to competition from other insurance companies  the pma insurance group competes with certain alternative market arrangements  such as captive insurers  risk sharing pools and associations  risk retention groups  and self insurance programs 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us 
the main factors upon which entities in our markets compete are price  service  product capabilities and financial security 
the pma insurance group attempts to price its products in such a way that the prices charged to its clients are commensurate with the overall marketplace while still adhering to our underwriting standards 
the pma insurance group will reject or non renew accounts where we believe the market rates  terms and conditions for such risks are not acceptable 
we maintain service standards concerning turn around time for underwriting submissions  information flow  claims handling and the quality of other services 
these standards help ensure that clients are satisfied with our products and services 
we periodically participate in client surveys to gain an understanding of the perceptions of our service as compared to our competitors 
we attempt to design products that meet the needs of clients in our markets 
in recent years  the pma insurance group has developed products that reflect the evolving nature of the workers compensation market 
specifically  it has developed pma one  a product that provides for group integrated occupational and non occupational disability coverages 
the pma insurance group has also increased its focus on rehabilitation and managed care to control workers compensation costs for the employers 
in addition  it also continues to benefit from writing business for insureds mainly operating in the pma insurance group s principal marketing territory but with some operations in other states 
see 
the pma insurance group products for additional discussion 
we continually evaluate new product opportunities for the pma insurance group 
industry trends during the late s and into  the property and casualty insurance industry was characterized by excess capacity  which resulted in highly competitive market conditions evidenced by declining premium rates and  in many cases  policy terms less favorable to the insurers 
as a result of this prolonged soft market  capacity in the property and casualty market began to contract late in  as companies withdrew from the business or ceased operations 

table of contents in response to market conditions  many insurance and reinsurance companies  including our companies  independently sought and achieved significant price increases and improved policy terms commencing in the second half of in  we realized price increases at the pma insurance group in excess of 
these increases continued in and  but at a lesser rate 
the pma insurance group obtained price increases of for its workers compensation business in and in we have also increased the relative amount by which we can adjust insureds premiums based on actual losses incurred on loss sensitive products 
despite current market conditions  there can be no assurance that prices and premiums will increase at a level consistent with loss cost inflation 
even if the industry in general experiences those types of increases  we cannot assure you that we will see similar increases or that we will achieve price increases consistent with further  any benefit that we derive from such price increases may be partially or completely offset by increases in ceded reinsurance premiums  frequency of reported losses or by loss cost inflation 
run off operations in november  we announced our decision to withdraw from the reinsurance business previously served by our pma re operating segment 
we are no longer writing new reinsurance business 
as a result of this decision  the results of pma re are reported as run off operations 
run off operations also includes the results of our former excess and surplus lines business  which we placed in run off in may see 
note in item of this form k for additional information regarding the run off operations 
reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company  the reinsurer  agrees to indemnify another insurance company  the ceding company  against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts 
reinsurance provides ceding companies with several benefits reducing exposure on individual risks  protecting against catastrophic losses  stabilizing underwriting results and maintaining acceptable capital ratios 
late in  pma re invested in a lloyd s of london managing general agency  cathedral capital plc  and commencing in  we began participating in the results of syndicate  which primarily writes property and aviation reinsurance 
cathedral capital primarily provides underwriting and management services for various lloyd s syndicates providing primarily property and casualty coverages 
cathedral capital agreed to indemnify us for losses exceeding  arising from syndicate related to the and underwriting years of account in which we participated 
in consideration for the indemnification  we agreed to pay cathedral capital of any underwriting profit related to the and years of account 
during  we sold our interest in cathedral capital and recorded a gain of million on the sale 
pma re had five distinct underwriting units  organized by class of business 
the traditional treaty  finite risk and financial products  specialty treaty  and accident treaty units provided treaty reinsurance coverage 
the fifth unit  facultative  provided reinsurance on a facultative basis 
the traditional treaty underwriting unit wrote general property and casualty business 
the traditional casualty portfolio included general liability  umbrella  commercial automobile and workers compensation 
the finite risk and financial products underwriting unit provided pma re s insurance company clients with risk management solutions that complemented their traditional reinsurance program 
under its finite risk covers  pma re assumed a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for a specified margin 
our finite risk reinsurance covers typically included a combination of sub limits and caps on the maximum gain or loss to pma re as the reinsurer 
as part of our run off strategy  we sold the renewal rights to the business in november the specialty treaty underwriting unit wrote business that fell outside the confines of our traditional property and casualty risks 
the facultative underwriting unit wrote property and casualty reinsurance on an individual risk basis and on a program semi automatic basis  in which we agreed to accept risks that fell within certain predetermined parameters 
the accident treaty unit offered a wide variety of accident products to life insurance companies  writers of workers compensation insurance and writers of special risk insurance 
in  we entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with a third party reinsurer covering all of the liabilities of the accident treaty unit occurring after december   in return for of the unit s unearned premiums 

table of contents our excess and surplus lines business focused on excess and surplus lines of insurance for low frequency high severity risks that were declined by the standard market 
the run off operations wrote business throughout the united states  generally through surplus lines brokers 
the claims departments of the run off operations analyze reported claims  establish individual claim reserves  pay claims  provide claims related services to clients and audit the claims activities of selected clients 
the claims department s evaluation of claims activity includes reviewing loss reports received from ceding companies to confirm that claims are covered under the terms of the relevant reinsurance contract  establishing reserves on an individual case basis and monitoring the adequacy of those reserves 
the claims department also monitors the progress and ultimate outcome of the claims to determine that subrogation  salvage and other cost recovery opportunities have been adequately explored 
the claims department performs these functions in coordination with the actuarial department 
in addition to evaluating and adjusting claims  the claims department conducts claims audits at the offices of selected ceding companies 
the claims department also conducts annual claims audits of many client ceding companies 
reinsurance and retrocessional protection we follow the customary insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries 
this reinsurance is maintained to protect the insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss 
although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to policyholders for losses insured under the insurance policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
the ceded reinsurance agreements of our insurance subsidiaries generally may be terminated at their annual anniversary by either party upon to days notice 
in general  the reinsurance agreements are treaty agreements  which cover all underwritten risks of the types specified in the treaties 
our reinsurance is on a per risk and per occurrence basis 
per risk reinsurance offers reinsurance protection for each risk involved in each occurrence 
per occurrence reinsurance is a form of reinsurance under which the date of the loss event is deemed to be the date of the occurrence regardless of when reported and permits all losses arising out of one event to be aggregated 
see 
item md a reinsurance and 
note in item of this k for additional information 
loss reserves insurers establish reserves representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims with respect to insured events that have occurred  including events that have not been reported to the insurer 
reserves are also established for lae representing the estimated expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees  and general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
after a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of management based on reserving practices and management s experience and knowledge regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim 
claims personnel review and update their estimates as additional information becomes available and claims proceed toward resolution 
in addition  reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the insurer  to provide for the estimated expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees and general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process  and to adjust for the fact that  in the aggregate  case reserves may not accurately estimate the ultimate liability for reported claims 
reserves are estimated using various generally accepted actuarial methodologies 
as part of the reserving process  historical and industry data is reviewed and consideration is given to the anticipated impact of various factors such as legal developments  changes in social attitudes and economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this 
table of contents process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effect of current developments and probable trends  provides a reasonable basis for predicting future events 
the reserving process provides implicit recognition of the impact of inflation and other factors affecting claims payments by taking into account changes in historic payment patterns and perceived probable trends 
there is generally no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the adequacy of the consideration given to inflation or to any other specific factor  since the eventual deficiency or redundancy of reserves is affected by many factors  some of which are interdependent 
due to the long tail nature of a significant portion of our business  in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss 
we define long tail business as those lines of business in which a majority of coverage involves average loss payment lags of several years beyond the expiration of the policy 
our major long tail lines include our workers compensation and casualty reinsurance business 
in addition  because reinsurers rely on their ceding companies to provide them with information regarding incurred losses  reported claims for reinsurers become known more slowly than for primary insurers and are generally subject to more unforeseen development and uncertainty 
estimating our ultimate claims liability is necessarily a complex and judgmental process inasmuch as the amounts are based on management s informed estimates  assumptions and judgments using data currently available 
as additional experience and data become available regarding claims payment and reporting patterns  legal and legislative developments  judicial theories of liability  the impact of regulatory trends on benefit levels for both medical and indemnity payments  changes in social attitudes and economic conditions  the estimates are revised accordingly 
if our ultimate losses  net of reinsurance  prove to differ substantially from the amounts recorded at december   the related adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the table on the next page presents the subsequent development of the estimated year end property and casualty reserves  net of reinsurance net reserves  for the ten years prior to the first section of the table shows the estimated net reserves that were recorded at the end of each respective year for all current and prior year unpaid losses and lae 
the second section shows the cumulative amounts of such previously recorded net reserves paid in succeeding years 
the third section shows the re estimates of the net reserves made in each succeeding year 
the cumulative deficiency redundancy as shown in the table represents the aggregate change in the reserve estimates from the original balance sheet dates through december   an increase in a loss estimate that related to a prior year occurrence generates a deficiency in each intervening year 
for example  a deficiency first recognized in relating to losses incurred in would be included in the cumulative deficiency amount for each of the years through however  the deficiency would be reflected in operating results in only 
conditions and trends that have affected the reserve development reflected in the table may change  and care should be exercised in extrapolating future reserve redundancies or deficiencies from such development

loss reserves and reinsurance 
unpaid losses and lae on a gaap basis were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
unpaid losses and lae on a statutory basis were million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the difference between gaap and statutory loss reserves reflects reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and lae  which are recorded as assets for gaap but netted against statutory loss reserves  and non us domiciled insurance companies  whose unpaid losses and lae are included for gaap purposes  but not for statutory purposes 
at december  and  our gross unpaid losses and lae were recorded net of discount of million and million  respectively 
our net liability for unpaid losses and lae was recorded net of discount of million and million at december  and  respectively 
unpaid losses for our workers compensation claims  net of reinsurance  at december  and were million and million  
table of contents net of discount of million and million  respectively 
unpaid losses on certain workers compensation claims are discounted to present value using our payment experience and mortality and interest assumptions in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed by the pennsylvania insurance department 
we also discount unpaid losses and lae for certain other claims at rates permitted by domiciliary regulators or if the timing and amount of such claims are fixed and determinable 
pre tax income loss is negatively impacted by accretion of discount on prior year reserves and favorably impacted by recording of discount for current year reserves 
the net of these amounts is referred to as net discount accretion 
net discount accretion reduced pre tax results by million in and benefited pre tax results by million 
at december   our loss reserves were stated net of million of salvage and subrogation 
our policy with respect to estimating the amounts and realizability of salvage and subrogation is to develop accident year schedules of historic paid salvage and subrogation by line of business  which are then projected to an ultimate basis using actuarial projection techniques 
the anticipated salvage and subrogation is the estimated ultimate salvage and subrogation less any amounts received by us 
the realizability of anticipated salvage and subrogation is reflected in the historical data that is used to complete the projection  as historical paid data implicitly considers realization and collectibility 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets 
our investment objectives are to i seek competitive after tax income and total return as appropriate  ii maintain medium to high investment grade asset quality and high marketability  iii maintain maturity distribution commensurate with our business objectives  iv provide portfolio flexibility for changing business and investment climates and v provide liquidity to meet operating objectives 
our investment strategy includes guidelines for asset quality standards  asset allocations among investment types and issuers  and other relevant criteria for our portfolio 
in addition  invested asset cash flows  both current income and investment maturities  are structured after considering projected liability cash flows of loss reserve payouts using actuarial models 
property and casualty claim demands are somewhat unpredictable in nature and require liquidity from the underlying invested assets  which are structured to emphasize current investment income to the extent consistent with maintaining appropriate portfolio quality and diversity 
the liquidity requirements are met primarily through publicly traded fixed maturities as well as operating cash flows and short term investments

ratings nationally recognized ratings agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and of the debt of pma capital corporation 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims  factors more relevant to policyholders than investors 
we believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized  independent rating agencies  particularly am best  are material to our operations 
we currently participate in the ratings process of am best and moody s investor services 
other rating agencies also rate our securities  which we do not disclose in our reports 

table of contents the rating scales of am best and moody s are characterized as follows am best a to s superior to suspended moody s aaa to c exceptional financial security to lowest rated class as of february   the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt ratings of pma capital corporation  as published by the principal rating agencies  are as follows financial strength ratings a

pooled companies

pma capital corporation b th of developing outlook 
the pooled companies represent the domestic subsidiary insurance companies through which the pma insurance group writes its insurance business  which share results through an intercompany pooling agreement 
the pooled companies are rated as one entity 
a downgrade in the am best financial strength rating of the pooled companies would result in a material loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings 
accordingly  such a downgrade to our am best insurer financial strength rating would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
a downgrade in our debt ratings will affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt  and  accordingly  will increase our cost of capital 
in addition  a downgrade of our debt ratings will make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries 
these ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and therefore  no assurance can be given that we or our principal insurance subsidiaries can maintain these ratings 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

regulatory matters general one or more of the pma insurance group s pooled companies are licensed to transact insurance business in  and are subject to regulation and supervision by  jurisdictions including puerto rico and the district of columbia 
pmacic is licensed or accredited to transact business in  and is subject to regulation and supervision by  states and the district of columbia 
our insurance subsidiaries are authorized and regulated in all jurisdictions where they conduct insurance business 
in supervising and regulating insurance and reinsurance companies  state insurance departments  charged primarily with protecting policyholders and the public rather than investors  enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulations for that purpose 
the pooled companies and pmacic are domiciled in pennsylvania  and the pennsylvania insurance department exercises principal regulatory jurisdiction over them 
the extent of regulation by the states varies  but in general  most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency  adequacy of reserves  reinsurance  capital adequacy and standards of business conduct 

table of contents in addition  statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents  the approval of policy forms  certain terms and conditions and related material and  for certain lines of insurance  including rate sensitive workers compensation  the approval of rates 
property and casualty reinsurers are generally not subject to filing or other regulatory requirements applicable to primary standard lines insurers with respect to rates  underwriting rules and policy forms 
the form and content of statutory financial statements are regulated 
the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  however  federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry 
in november  the terrorism risk insurance act of tria became effective 
tria provides federal reinsurance protection for property and casualty losses in the united states or to united states aircraft or vessels arising from certified terrorist acts through the end of tria expires on december  and although legislation has been introduced in congress to extend tria  there is no assurance that it will be re enacted or extended 
for terrorist acts to be covered under tria  they must be certified as such by the united states government and must be committed by individuals acting on behalf of a foreign person or interest 
tria contains a make available provision  which requires insurers subject to the act  to offer coverage for acts of terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms other than price  amounts and other coverage limitations offered to the policyholder for losses from events other than acts of terrorism 
the make available provision permits exclusions for certain types of losses  if a state permits exclusions for such losses 
tria requires insurers to retain losses based on a percentage of their commercial lines direct earned premiums for the prior year equal to a deductible for the federal government covers of the losses above the deductible  while a company retains of the losses 
tria contains an annual limit of billion of covered industry wide losses 
tria applies to commercial lines of property and casualty insurance  including workers compensation insurance  offered by the pma insurance group  but does not apply to reinsurance 
the pma insurance group would have a deductible of approximately million in if a covered terrorist act were to occur 
workers compensation insurers were not permitted to exclude terrorism from coverage prior to the enactment of tria  and continue to be subject to this prohibition 
when underwriting new and renewal commercial insurance business  the pma insurance group considers the added potential risk of loss due to terrorist activity  and this may lead it to decline to write or non renew certain business 
additional rates may be charged for terrorism coverage  and as of january   the pma insurance group had adopted premium charges for workers compensation insurance in all states 
the pma insurance group has also refined its underwriting procedures in consideration of terrorism risks 
however  because of the unpredictable nature of terrorism  tria s uncertain application  the amount of terrorism losses that the pma insurance group must retain under tria and the fact that tria does not apply to  and we do not have terrorism exclusions in all of  our reinsurance business  future terrorist attacks may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

further  although we do not write health insurance  federal and state rules and regulations affecting health care services can affect the workers compensation services we provide 
we cannot predict what health care reform legislation will be adopted by congress or by state legislatures where we do business or the effect  if any  that the adoption of health care legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will have on our results of operations 
state insurance departments in jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business also conduct periodic examinations of their respective operations and accounts and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to their financial condition 
the pennsylvania insurance department has completed examinations of pma capital insurance company and the pooled companies as of december  the examinations did not result in any material adjustments to our statutory capital as previously filed in our statutory financial statements 
no material qualitative matters were raised as a result of the examinations 
insurance holding company regulation the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
pennsylvania s state insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers and reinsurers that are members of such insurance holding company s system to register with the insurance department authorities  to file with it certain reports disclosing information including their capital structure  ownership  management  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions  including material transfers of assets and intercompany business agreements  and to report material changes in that 
table of contents information 
these laws also require that intercompany transactions be fair and reasonable and  under certain circumstances  prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department must be received before entering into an intercompany transaction 
further  these laws require that an insurer s policyholders surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates be reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs 
as a result of discussions with the pennsylvania insurance department  pmacic entered into a voluntary agreement with the department  dated december  pursuant to the agreement  pmacic agreed to request the department s prior approval of certain actions  including entering into any new reinsurance contracts  treaties or agreements  except as may be required by law  making any payments  dividends or other distributions to  or engaging in any transactions with  any of pmacic s affiliates  making any withdrawal of monies from pmacic s bank accounts or making any disbursements  payments or transfers of assets in an amount exceeding five percent which equaled million as of december  of the fair market value of pmacic s then aggregate cash and investments  incurring any debt  obligation or liability for borrowed money  pledging its assets or loaning monies to any person or entity whether or not affiliated  appointing any new director or executive officer  or altering its or its pennsylvania domiciled insurance company subsidiaries ownership structure 
the letter agreement shall remain in effect until the commissioner  or pmacic and the commissioner  determine it is no longer necessary  or until and unless it is superseded by a regulatory order 
in june  the pennsylvania insurance department approved our application for the pooled companies  previously subsidiaries of pmacic  to become direct  wholly owned subsidiaries of pma capital corporation 
however  in its order approving the transfer of the pooled companies from pmacic to pma capital corporation  the pennsylvania insurance department prohibited pmacic from any declaration or payment of dividends  return of capital or any other types of distributions in and to pma capital corporation 
in  pmacic may declare and pay ordinary dividends or returns of capital without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department if  immediately after giving effect to the dividend or returns of capital  pmacic s risk based capital equals or exceeds of authorized control level capital as defined by the national association of insurance commissioners 
in and beyond  pmacic may make dividend payments  as long as such dividends are not considered extraordinary under pennsylvania insurance law 
under pennsylvania law  no person may acquire  directly or indirectly  a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person  corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the commissioner for such acquisition of control 
pursuant to the pennsylvania law  any person acquiring  controlling or holding the power to vote  directly or indirectly  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurance company  is presumed to have control of such company 
this presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact 
the commissioner  however  may find that control exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities 
to obtain approval from the commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company  the proposed acquirer must file with the commissioner an application containing information regarding the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates  the nature  source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition  the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates  any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer  the number and type of securities to be acquired  any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired  any agreements with broker dealers  and other matters 
other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions 
additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control 
as further described below  laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries 
restrictions on subsidiaries dividends and other payments we are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries 
our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
under pennsylvania laws and regulations  our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends only from unassigned surplus and future earnings arising from their businesses and must receive prior approval of the pennsylvania 
table of contents insurance commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend would exceed the statutory limitation 
the current statutory limitation is the greater of i of the insurer s policyholders surplus  as shown on its last annual statement on file with the pennsylvania insurance commissioner or ii the insurer s statutory net income for the previous calendar year  but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus 
pennsylvania law gives the pennsylvania insurance commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
pennsylvania law also provides that following the payment of any dividend  the insurer s policyholders surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs  and permits the pennsylvania insurance commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these standards 
in the event that the pennsylvania insurance commissioner determines that the policyholders surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate  the commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary 
the pooled companies paid dividends of million to pma capital corporation in as of december   the pma insurance group s pooled companies can pay up to million in dividends to pma capital corporation during without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department 
in considering its future dividend policy  the pooled companies will consider  among other things  the impact of paying dividends on its financial strength ratings 
see 
insurance holding company regulation on page for information regarding restrictions on pmacic s ability to pay dividends to pma capital corporation 
in addition to the regulatory restrictions  we may not declare or pay cash dividends or distributions on our class a common stock if we elect to exercise our right to defer interest payments on our million of trust preferred debt outstanding 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted risk based capital requirements for property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  asset and liability matching  loss reserve adequacy and other business factors 
under risk based capital rbc requirements  regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company s total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level of rbc known as the rbc ratio  also as defined by the naic 
four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the rbc ratio is insufficient company action level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake 
regulatory action level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the insurer must submit a plan  but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period 
authorized control level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the regulatory response is the same as at the regulatory action level  but in addition  the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
mandatory control level if the rbc ratio is less than  then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
at december   the rbc ratios of the pooled companies ranged from to and pmacic s rbc ratio was 
we believe that we will be able to maintain the rbc ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of company action level through prudent underwriting  claims handling  investing and capital management 
however  no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries  many of which could be outside of our control  including but not limited to changes in the regulatory environment  economic conditions and competitive conditions in the jurisdictions in which we write business  will not cause the rbc ratios to fall below required levels resulting in a corresponding regulatory response 

table of contents the naic has also developed a series of twelve ratios known as the iris ratios designed to further assist regulators in assessing the financial condition of insurers 
these ratio results are computed annually and reported to the naic and the insurer s state of domicile 
in  each of the pooled companies reported unusual values in two ratios  relating to change in net premiums written  and investment yield 
the unusual value related to change in net premiums written was a result of our decrease in writings primarily due to the b financial strength rating 
the unusual value related to investment yield related primarily to a decrease in yield on our bond portfolio 
in  pmacic reported five unusual values  relating to liabilities to liquid assets ratio  investment yield  change in policyholder s surplus  the two year overall operating ratio  and change in net premiums 
the unusual value relating to the liabilities to liquid assets ratio is principally due to assets  such as funds held by reinsureds and deposit accounting assets  that are not included as assets for purposes of the calculation 
the unusual value related to investment yield relates primarily to a decrease in yield on our bond portfolio 
the unusual value related to the change in policyholder s surplus is due to the transfer of the pooled companies to pma capital corporation during the unusual value relating to the two year overall operating ratio related to the unfavorable prior year loss development in the unusual value for change in net premiums written related primarily to the cessation of writing new business at pmacic

table of contents risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be affected materially 
reserves are estimates and do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability 
if our actual losses from insureds exceed our loss reserves  our financial results would be adversely affected 
we establish reserves representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims with respect to insured events that have occurred  including events that have not been reported to us 
we also establish reserves for loss adjustment expenses  which represent the estimated expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees  and general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
our reserves as of december  were in the aggregate billion  consisting of billion related to the pma insurance group and million related to run off operations 
during the years ended december  and  we increased our reserves for prior years losses and loss adjustment expenses by million and million  respectively 
reserves are estimates and do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability 
the reserving process involves actuarial models  which rely on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effect of current developments and likely trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating insurance reserves are generally greater for casualty coverages than for property coverages 
due to the long tail nature of a significant portion of our business  in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss 
we define long tail business as those lines of business in which a majority of coverage involves average loss payment lags of several years beyond the expiration of the policy 
our major long tail lines include our workers compensation and casualty reinsurance business 
in addition  because reinsurers rely on their ceding companies to provide them with information regarding incurred losses  liabilities for reinsurers become known more slowly than for primary insurers and are subject to more unforeseen development and uncertainty 
reserve estimates are continually refined through an ongoing process as further claims are reported and settled and additional information concerning loss experience becomes known 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  our current reserves may prove inadequate in light of subsequent developments 
if we increase our reserves  our earnings for the period will generally decrease by a corresponding amount 
therefore  future reserve increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and financial strength and credit ratings 
we have recorded significant reserve charges in the past and if we experience additional significant reserve charges it could adversely affect our ability to continue in the ordinary course of our business 
we have recorded significant reserve charges in the past 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million pre tax  related to higher than expected underwriting losses  primarily from casualty reinsurance business written in accident years to as a result of this charge  the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and our debt ratings were reduced  and we decided to exit the reinsurance business 
we also suspended the payment of our regular cash dividend 
our capital position was also diminished 
if  in the future  actual losses and loss adjustment expenses develop larger than our loss reserve estimates  which may be due to a wide range of factors  including inflation  changes in claims and litigation trends and legislative or regulatory changes  we would have to increase reserves 
a significant increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue in the ordinary course of our business 
we experienced a significant reduction in premium volume in following our ratings downgrade 
we reported consolidated net premiums written of  million in for  we had consolidated net premiums written of million  a decrease of million  or  from the lower net premiums written in reflect the impact of our decision to exit the reinsurance business and  to a lesser extent  the impact to the pma insurance group s operations of its b am best financial strength rating between november and november a further reduction in premium volume  or a continuation of the reduced volumes experienced in  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents because insurance ratings  particularly from am best  are important to our policyholders downgrades in our ratings may adversely affect us 
nationally recognized ratings agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
between november and november  the pma insurance group s financial strength rating was downgraded from a to b which constrained its ability to attract and retain business 
certain clients  particularly large account clients and clients in the construction industry will not purchase property and casualty insurance from insurers with less than an a th of am best rating 
the pma insurance group s a rating was restored on november   however  any future downgrade in the pma insurance group s am best rating could result in a material loss of business as policyholders could move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings and we could lose key executives necessary to operate our business 
accordingly  such a downgrade to our insurer financial strength ratings will likely result in lower premiums written and lower profitability and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
these ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and therefore  no assurance can be given that we or our principal insurance subsidiaries can maintain or improve these ratings 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
the pennsylvania insurance department s restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends from pma capital insurance company could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
in june  the pennsylvania insurance department approved our application for our primary insurance subsidiaries that comprise the pma insurance group  or the pooled companies  previously subsidiaries of pmacic  to become direct  wholly owned subsidiaries of pma capital corporation 
as a result  the pooled companies became direct subsidiaries of pma capital corporation and can pay dividends directly to pma capital corporation 
in its order approving the unstacking  the pennsylvania insurance department prohibited pmacic from any declaration or payment of dividends or return of capital or any other types of distributions in and to pma capital corporation 
in  pmacic may declare and pay ordinary dividends or return of capital without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department if  immediately after giving effect to the dividend or return of capital  pmacic s risk based capital equals or exceeds of authorized control level capital  as defined by the national association of insurance commissioners 
in and beyond  pmacic may make dividend payments  as long as such dividends are not considered extraordinary under pennsylvania law 
as a result  we may not be able to receive dividends from pmacic at times and in amounts necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses 
as of december   the statutory surplus of pmacic was million and its risk based capital ratio was of authorized control level capital 
we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and our other financial obligations 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to service our indebtedness and to meet our other financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which in turn is subject to market conditions and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
in order to obtain funds sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness as well as meet our other financial obligations  we may need to raise additional capital through the sale of securities or certain of our assets 
however  we may not be able to enter into or complete any such transactions by the maturity date or put date of our indebtedness or on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us 
in addition  we may be required to use all or a portion of the proceeds of such transactions to repay obligations under our convertible debt or our monthly income senior notes due accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and to meet our other financial obligations 
the indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain activities 
the indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  
table of contents pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock  make certain investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  transfer or dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries  and merge or consolidate with another company 
the above restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities 
because credit ratings are important to our creditors  downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect us 
nationally recognized rating agencies rate the debt of pma capital corporation 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
a downgrade in our debt ratings will affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt  and  accordingly  will increase our cost of capital 
in addition  a downgrade of our debt ratings will make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries 
our reserves for asbestos and environmental claims may be insufficient 
estimating reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures continues to be difficult because of several factors  including i evolving methodologies for the estimation of the liabilities  ii lack of reliable historical claim data  iii uncertainties with respect to insurance and reinsurance coverage related to these obligations  iv changing judicial interpretations  and v changing government standards and regulations 
we believe that our reserves for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts  existing case law and generally accepted actuarial methodologies 
however  due to changing interpretations by courts involving coverage issues  the potential for changes in federal and state standards for clean up and liability  as well as issues involving policy provisions  allocation of liability and damages among participating insurers  and proof of coverage  our ultimate exposure for these claims may vary significantly from the amounts currently recorded  resulting in a potential future adjustment that could be material to our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may harm our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues that have affected us include increases in the number and size of claims relating to construction defects and mold  which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions  making it difficult for us to predict our exposure to losses  and changes in interpretation of the named insured provision with respect to the uninsured underinsured motorist coverage in commercial automobile policies  effectively broadening coverage and increasing our exposure to claims 

table of contents the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business 
we rely on independent agents and brokers and therefore we are exposed to certain risks 
approximately of the pma insurance group s business in was produced through independent agents and brokers 
we do business with a large number of independent brokers on a non exclusive basis and we cannot rely on their ongoing commitment to our insurance products 
in accordance with industry practice  our customers often pay the premiums for their policies to agents and brokers for payment over to us 
these premiums are considered paid when received by the broker and  thereafter  the customer is no longer liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the agent or broker 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with our reliance on agents and brokers in connection with the settlement of insurance balances 
additionally  the new york attorney general and certain state regulators have initiated investigations and commenced legal actions against certain brokers and other insurance companies concerning their commission agreements and other practices 
the outcome of these investigations and actions and the impact of any regulatory changes governing agent and broker commissions is uncertain 
any disruption in the ability of agents and brokers to sell our insurance products could harm our business 
our failure to realize our deferred income tax asset could lead to a writedown  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
realization of our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the generation of taxable income in those jurisdictions where the relevant tax losses and other timing differences exist 
as of december   our net deferred tax asset was million 
failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a writedown in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected 
we face a risk of non collectibility of reinsurance  which could materially affect our results of operations 
we follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries known as ceding 
during  we had million of gross premiums written of which we ceded million  or of gross premiums written  to reinsurers for reinsurance protection 
this reinsurance is maintained to protect our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss 
although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay policyholders for losses insured under the policies we issue  reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
as of december   we had billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses  for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance contracts 
our ability to collect reinsurance is dependent upon numerous factors including the solvency of our reinsurers  the payment performance of our reinsurers and whether there are any disputes or collection issues with our reinsurers 
we perform credit reviews on our reinsurers  focusing on  among other things  financial capacity  stability  trends and commitment to the reinsurance business 
we also require assets in trust  letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions 
despite these measures  a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
because we are heavily regulated by the states in which we do business  we may be limited in the way we operate 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business 
the supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance policyholders  and not our investors 
the extent of regulation varies  but generally is governed by state statutes 
these statutes delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments 

table of contents this system of supervision and regulation covers  among other things standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates  including us  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  limitations on the rates that we may charge on our primary insurance business  restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations  limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay  the existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business  certain required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  and assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
on december   pmacic entered into a voluntary agreement with the pennsylvania insurance department 
pursuant to the agreement  pmacic has agreed to request the pennsylvania insurance department s prior approval of certain actions  including entering into any new reinsurance contracts  treaties or agreements  except as may be required by law  making any payments  dividends or other distributions to  or engaging in any transactions with  any of pmacic s affiliates  making any withdrawal of monies from pmacic s bank accounts or making any disbursements  payments or transfers of assets in an amount exceeding five percent of the fair market value of pmacic s then aggregate cash and investments  incurring any debt  obligation or liability for borrowed money  pledging its assets or loaning monies to any person or entity whether or not affiliated  appointing any new director or executive officer  or altering its or its pennsylvania domiciled insurance company subsidiaries ownership structure 
finally  the pennsylvania insurance department may impose additional operational or administrative restrictions deemed necessary by the pennsylvania insurance commissioner for implementation of the agreement 
these restrictions  as well as any further restrictions on the conduct of pmacic s business  may adversely affect its ability to efficiently conduct the run off of its insurance liabilities 
in june  the pennsylvania insurance department approved our application for the pooled companies  previously subsidiaries of pmacic  to become direct  wholly owned subsidiaries of pma capital corporation 
however  in its order approving the transfer of the pooled companies from pmacic to pma capital corporation  the pennsylvania insurance department prohibited pmacic from any declaration or payment of dividends  return of capital or any other types of distributions in and to pma capital corporation 
in  pmacic may declare and pay ordinary dividends or returns of capital without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department if  immediately after giving effect to the dividend or returns of capital  pmacic s risk based capital equals or exceeds of authorized control level capital as defined by the national association of insurance commissioners 
in and beyond  pmacic may make dividend payments  as long as such dividends are not considered extraordinary under pennsylvania insurance law 
the regulations of the state insurance departments may affect the cost or demand for our products and may impede us from obtaining rate increases on insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations or taking other actions we might wish to take to increase our profitability 
further  we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations  which may change from time to 
table of contents time 
also  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 
further  insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision  which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company 
as of december   no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in light of recent insolvencies of large property and casualty insurers  it is possible that the regulations governing the level of the guaranty fund or association assessments against us may change  requiring us to increase our level of payments 
our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including cyclical changes in the insurance industry 
the results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
the industry s profitability can be affected significantly by rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes  changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability develop  fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of losses  and volatility associated with the long tail nature of the reinsurance business  which may impact our operating results 
the property and casualty insurance industry historically is cyclical in nature 
the demand for property and casualty insurance can vary significantly  rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as such activity decreases 
the property and casualty insurance industry has been very competitive and the fluctuations in demand and competition and the impact on us of other factors identified above could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive industry which makes it more difficult to attract and retain new business 
our business is highly competitive and we believe that it will remain so for the foreseeable future 
the pma insurance group has six major competitors liberty mutual insurance company  american international group  inc  zurich farmers group  st 
paul travelers  the hartford insurance group and cna 
all of these companies and some of our other competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry 
these developments include an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their business and new companies attempt to enter the insurance and reinsurance business  the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act of which permits financial services companies  such as banks and brokerage firms  to engage in certain insurance activities  which could result in increased competition from financial services companies  programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage  and 
table of contents changing practices caused by technology  which have led to greater competition in the insurance business 
many commercial property and casualty insurers and industry groups and associations currently offer alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products 
these products  including large deductible programs and various forms of self insurance that utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups  have been instituted to allow for better control of risk management and costs 
we cannot predict how continued growth in alternative forms of risk protection will affect our future results of operations  but it could reduce our premium volume 
following the terrorist attacks on september   a number of new insurers and reinsurers have been formed to compete in our industry  and a number of existing market participants have raised new capital which may enhance their ability to compete with us 
in addition  other financial institutions are now able to offer services similar to our own as a result of the gramm leach bliley act  which was adopted in november because our investment portfolio is primarily fixed income securities  the fair value of our investment portfolio and our investment income could suffer as a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we currently maintain and intend to continue to maintain an investment portfolio primarily of fixed income securities 
the fair value of these securities can fluctuate depending on changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair market value of these investments increases or decreases in an inverse relationship to changes in interest rates  while net investment income earned by us from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
our overall investment strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant concentrations in individual issuers  industry segments and geographic regions 
however  there can be no assurance that our investment securities will not become impaired or decline in quality or value 
all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  as a result  changes in the market value of our fixed income securities are reflected in our balance sheet 
accordingly  changes in interest rates may result in fluctuations in the income from  and the valuation of  our fixed income investments  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is dependent upon our key executives  certain of whom do not have employment agreements with restrictive covenants and can leave our employment at any time 
our success depends significantly on the efforts and abilities of our key executives 
we currently have employment agreements that include restrictive covenants with three of our key executives  however  we do not have employment agreements with our other executives 
accordingly  such other executives may leave our employ at any time 
our future results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current executives  attract new executives or if our current executives leave our employ and join companies that compete with us 
we have exposure to catastrophic events  which can materially affect our financial results 
we are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for catastrophes until such event takes place 
therefore  although we actively manage our exposure to catastrophes through our underwriting process and the purchase of reinsurance protection  an especially severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes  or terrorist event  could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
man made events  such as terrorism  can also cause catastrophes 
for example  the attack on the world trade center has  to date  resulted in approximately million in pre tax losses to us  after deduction of all reinsurance and retrocessional protection  for because of the jury verdict on december  that concluded that the attack on the world trade center was two occurrences instead of one  this estimate may change 
however  it is difficult to fully estimate our losses from the attack given the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts  the possible development of additional facts related to the attack and whether the recent court decision will 
table of contents be successfully appealed 
as more information becomes available  we may need to change our estimate of these losses 
although the terrorism risk insurance act of tria may mitigate the impact of future terrorism losses in connection with the commercial insurance business offered by the pma insurance group  because of its uncertain application  the amount of losses a company must retain and the fact that it does not apply to reinsurance business  future terrorist attacks may result in losses that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
tria expires on december  and although legislation has been introduced in congress to extend tria  there is no assurance that it will be re enacted or extended 
we face a risk of non availability of reinsurance  which could materially affect our ability to write business and our results of operations 
market conditions beyond our control  such as the amount of surplus in the reinsurance market and natural and man made catastrophes  determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase 
we cannot assure you that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
if we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient  we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or reduce our insurance writings 
purported class action lawsuits may result in financial losses and may divert management resources 
in addition  we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
we and certain of our directors and key executive officers are defendants in several purported class actions that were filed in in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania by alleged purchasers of our class a common stock  the senior convertible debentures due and monthly income senior notes due on june   the district court issued an order consolidating the cases under the caption in re pma capital corporation securities litigation civil action no 
and appointing sheet metal workers local pension trust  alaska laborers employers retirement fund and communications workers of america for employees pension and death benefits as lead plaintiff 
on september   the plaintiffs filed an amended and consolidated complaint on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of our securities between may  and february  the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants violated section b of the exchange act  and rule b thereunder by making materially false and misleading public statements and material omissions during the class period regarding our underwriting performance  loss reserves and related internal controls 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants violated sections  a and of the securities act by making materially false and misleading statements in registration statements and prospectuses about our financial results  underwriting performance  loss reserves and related internal controls 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages  the right to rescind the purchases of securities in the public offerings  interest  and plaintiffs reasonable costs and expenses  including attorneys fees and expert fees 
we intend to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in this consolidated action 
the lawsuit is in its earliest stages  therefore  it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the impact on us 
however  the lawsuit may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are continuously involved in numerous lawsuits arising  for the most part  in the ordinary course of business  either as a liability insurer defending third party claims brought against our insureds  or as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it by our policyholders or other insurers 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 
our capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new and renewal business and rating agency capital requirements 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through financings 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders and the securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our shares of common stock 
if our need for capital arises because of significant losses  
table of contents the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are an insurance holding company with no direct operations 
statutory requirements governing dividends from our principal operating subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
we are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries 
our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
payments of dividends within any twelve month period and advances and repayments by our insurance operating subsidiaries are restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
generally this limitation is the greater of statutory net income for the preceding calendar year or of the statutory surplus  but only to the extent of unassigned surplus 
in addition  insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels  and could refuse to permit the payment of dividends of the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula 
provisions in our charter documents may impede attempts to replace or remove our board or management with management favored by shareholders 
our restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in our board of directors or management that shareholders may desire 
these provisions include requiring advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing business that can be acted on by shareholders at meetings  establishing a classified board of directors and permitting our board to increase its size and appoint directors to fill newly created board vacancies  requiring shareholders to show cause to remove one or more directors  and prohibiting shareholders from acting by written consent 

table of contents item properties our headquarters are located in a four story   square foot building that we own in blue bell  pennsylvania 
we lease approximately  square feet in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office space in yardley  pennsylvania  which previously housed our excess and surplus lines business and now is subleased to an unaffiliated third party 
through various wholly owned subsidiaries  we also own and occupy additional office facilities in three other locations and rent additional office space for our insurance operations in other locations 
we believe that such owned and leased properties are suitable and adequate for our current business operations 
item legal proceedings we are continuously involved in numerous lawsuits arising  for the most part  in the ordinary course of business  either as a liability insurer defending third party claims brought against our insureds  or as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it by our policyholders or other insurers

operating income loss  which is gaap net income loss excluding net realized investment gains and losses  is the financial performance measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate and assess the results of our insurance businesses 
accordingly  we report operating income by segment in note to our consolidated financial statements as required by sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our management and board of directors use operating income as the measure of financial performance because i net realized investment gains and losses are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments and ii in many instances  decisions to buy and sell securities are made at the holding company level  and such decisions result in net realized gains and losses that do not relate to the operations of the individual segments 
operating income loss does not replace net income loss as the gaap measure of our consolidated results of operations
