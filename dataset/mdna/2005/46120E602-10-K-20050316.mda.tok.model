item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and market the da vinci surgical system  an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation of surgery the third generation 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart  a high performance vision system and proprietary wristed instruments 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d visualization characteristic of open surgery  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery  or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced 
the da vinci surgical system is sold into multiple surgical specialties  principally urology  cardiac and general surgery 
to date  the majority of our revenues have come from the sales of the da vinci surgical system  which are high revenue dollar items 
a smaller percentage of our revenues have come from sales of endowrist instruments and accessories  which are lower revenue dollar items 
in addition  a portion of our revenue comes from ongoing service of installed da vinci surgical systems 
due to the high dollar revenue per system sold  small variation in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the useful life of each installed da vinci surgical system  we expect to generate revenue through sales of the endowrist instrument and accessories and ongoing service 
over the past three years  revenue generated from the sale of instruments  accessories  service and training increased from million  or of sales in to million  or of sales in to million  or of sales  in summary the year was our first profitable year of operations  during which we earned net income of million  or per diluted share 
we were profitable in each of the four quarters 
during  sales grew over and gross margin percentage improved to from in operating expenses were leveraged during as they grew to million while sales grew 
our financial success was driven by the ongoing adoption of the da vinci surgical system for use in urologic  cardiac  and general surgery procedures 
business highlights of were as follows we shipped da vinci surgical systems  an increase of over the systems we shipped in we realized million of recurring revenue  comprised of instrument  accessory  service and training revenue  up over compared to use of the da vinci surgical system for radical prostatectomy procedures grew more than from to this contributed significantly to our sales growth 
in july   the fda granted clearance for use of the da vinci surgical system for coronary anastomosis during cardiac revascularization procedures 
with this clearance  the da vinci system can be used to perform complete coronary bypass procedures in the united states 
we launched a significant number of new instruments  including our millimeter instrument line and our millimeter micro bipolar and maryland bipolar instruments 
as we continue to expand our instrument offering  we provide customers more surgical options and clinical capability  leading to increased system usage 

table of contents we opened new overseas markets in  including turkey and taiwan  and significantly grew our sales in australia and singapore 
we completed the final integration of the computer motion acquisition 
we met the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of computer motion acquisition in june  we acquired computer motion  inc in a stock transaction in which each outstanding share of computer motion common stock was converted into the right to receive of one share of our common stock after giving effect to our for reverse stock split effective july  in addition  we assumed all of computer motion s outstanding options and warrants 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
we believe that the computer motion acquisition resulted in the following benefits to our company our ownership of all of computer motion intellectual property  the addition of complementary products to our offerings  and the achievement of significant cost synergies and economies of scale 
upon completion of our acquisition of computer motion  our management approved plans to restructure the operations of the combined entity 
the plan provided for the elimination of redundant activities and facilities and the termination of the employment of approximately employees  representing of the computer motion positions  by december   generally with immediate severance payment upon termination 
the plan called for vacating and subleasing of the leased space in goleta  california  consolidating european operations into a single site  and closing computer motion s asia office 
we recorded a million accrual in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the restructuring accrual was recorded as a component of the purchase price 
later in  we increased the accrual by million primarily due to changes in estimates of employee severance costs 
in  we increased the accrual for the estimated losses to be incurred to sublet vacated facilities by million due to the change in estimates on assumptions used to calculate the losses on subleasing the vacated facilities 
these amounts were recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
in the quarter ended december   based on our cost structure and future development plans  we elected to completely shut down the goleta research and development facility effective march  as a result  we exited the last goleta rented facility and terminated the employment of a majority of the goleta based employees 
we recorded restructuring charges related to costs of one time employee termination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in and incurred an additional million of employee termination costs and costs to exit the leased facility in

year ended december  sales millions systems instruments accessories total product sales service training total sales domestic international total sales da vinci surgical system unit sales product sales product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to higher sales of systems  instruments  and accessories 
system sales increased to million in from million in reflecting growth in system unit sales of da vinci surgical systems and da vinci fourth arms 
systems were sold in  
table of contents compared to in fourth arms were sold in compared to in the fourth arm product was launched during the second quarter instrument and accessory sales increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by a larger number of installed systems in and higher utilization per system in product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher system and instrument and accessory revenue 
total system revenue increased to million in from million in  resulting from higher da vinci fourth arm revenue and the impact of computer motion products sold subsequent to the june  acquisition 
we sold da vinci surgical systems during  compared to in we sold fourth arm upgrades to the da vinci platform in compared to none in total computer motion system product sales were million  comprised in large part of aesop unit sales 
instrument and accessory revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the larger base of installed da vinci surgical systems and increased system utilization per site resulted in the increase in instrument and accessory revenue 
service sales service sales comprised of system service  installation and customer training  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in this area was driven by a larger base of da vinci surgical systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract 
the larger base of da vinci surgical systems under contract was driven by system sales adding to the installed base and the full year impact of eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  adopted prospectively during the third quarter of beginning july   service sales related to the first year of service began to be recognized as a separate unit of accounting of each da vinci surgical system sale with service sales recognized over the first year 
there were an average of systems under service contract in generating an average of  per system  compared to an average of systems under service contract in generating an average of  per system 
the increase in service revenue per system was primarily driven by the introduction of the da vinci fourth arm during the second quarter of four arm systems typically carry a higher contractual service rate than three arm systems 
service sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems generating service sales 
the installed base of systems generating service revenue grew by during reflecting the number of systems sold during for which service sales would be recognized throughout in addition  during the third quarter  we prospectively adopted eitf no 
as a result  beginning july   service sales related to the first year of service began to be recognized as a separate unit of accounting of each da vinci surgical system sale with service sales recognized over the first year 
in addition  computer motion s service sales added million to revenue as compared to gross profit total gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in  and million  or of sales in the improvement in overall gross profit during the period resulted primarily from lower product material costs  improved product reliability  improved manufacturing throughput  and leveraging our service and training organizations across a larger base of installed systems 
product sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in  and million  or of sales  in the increase in gross profit percentage from in to in was driven by leveraging 
table of contents manufacturing overhead across higher revenue  material cost reductions  the impact of euro denominated sales as the euro strengthened considerably against the us dollar  and the non recurrence of the computer motion impairment charges and brookhill wilk charges incurred in the decrease in product sales gross profit percentage from in to in was due to the computer motion impairment charges and brookhill wilk charges incurred in  partially offset by the lower product costs and improved system and instrument reliability 
service sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in and million in the year over year improvements and transition to positive service revenue gross profit in resulted from leveraging relatively fixed service and training cost pools across a larger base of da vinci surgical systems generating service revenue 
the larger base of da vinci surgical systems under contract was driven by system sales adding to the installed base and the impact of eitf no 
 adopted prospectively during the third quarter of beginning july   service sales related to the first year of service began to be recognized as a separate unit of accounting of each da vinci surgical system sale with service sales recognized over the first year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  tradeshow expenses  legal expenses  regulatory fees and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  up from million for the year over year increase was largely due to sales organization headcount growth to support higher sales  higher incentive compensation associated with achieving higher revenues and profitability  and additional accounting personnel  consulting  and auditing resources required to support sarbanes oxley compliance 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  up from million for the year over year increase was due to higher compensation and employee travel costs  resulting primarily from higher sales volume and the computer motion acquisition  intangible asset amortization and impairment  accounting fees  and general legal and insurance expense  offset by lower litigation expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
these enhancements represent significant improvements to our products 
research and development expenses also include expenditures for clinical trials and purchases of laboratory supplies 
research and development expenses for were million  up from million for the increase resulted primarily from higher compensation and project materials costs 
research and development expenses for were million  down from million for the year over year decrease resulted from lower project consulting and materials costs and lower clinical trials costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future 
deferred compensation we record deferred compensation as the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant for financial reporting purposes 
deferred compensation is 
table of contents amortized to research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
for  and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation and stock compensation totaling million  million and million  respectively 
we did not record non cash deferred compensation expense in research and development in for and  non cash deferred compensation expense included in research and development expenses was million and million  respectively 
for  and  non cash deferred compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses was million  million and million  respectively 
at december   all deferred compensation had been amortized 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase between and resulted primarily from higher interest income earned on higher cash and short term investment balances 
the increase between and resulted primarily from higher foreign exchange gains in resulting from transactions denominated in euro 
income tax expense income tax expense was million for the year ended december  there was no income tax expense recorded for the years ended december  and december  liquidity and capital resources historically  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of our equity securities 
sales of convertible preferred stock yielded proceeds of approximately million and public offerings of our common stock yielded proceeds of approximately million 
we have also financed operations through employee stock purchase and option plans as well as equipment financing arrangements 
at december   we had total stockholders equity of million and outstanding equipment financing debt of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted primarily from our net income of million  non cash expenses of million and proceeds from employee stock purchase and option plans of million  partially offset by net fixed asset additions of million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments and working capital resulted primarily from the million of net proceeds received from our follow on stock offering  offset mostly by the computer motion acquisition 
the decreases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital were primarily attributable to cash used to fund operating losses and to acquire fixed assets 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in and million in cash provided by operating activities in of million resulted from net income of million and non cash expenses of million  partially offset by million of working capital requirements 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million and working capital requirements of million  partially offset by non cash expenses of million 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million and working capital requirements of million  offset by non cash expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by investing activities of million in and net cash provided by investing activities of million in net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the net movement into short term investments from cash received from profitable operations along with the purchase of the land and 
table of contents building at our headquarters 
net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the net movement into short term investments from cash received from the follow on offering proceeds 
the cash provided by investing activities in related primarily to the net conversion of short term investments into cash to fund operations  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the cash provided by financing activities resulted from million of employee stock purchases and option and warrant exercise proceeds  offset by debt repayment of million 
the cash provided resulted primarily from our follow on common stock offering yielding million of net proceeds  with the remainder coming mostly from employee stock purchases and option exercises 
in  cash provided by financing activities resulted from proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting mainly from the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options of million and net long term equipment financing proceeds of million 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  together with income to be derived from the sale of our products  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations  net of sublease income of million  by payment due date payments by period thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations for inventory and other goods and services have not been included in the table above as these obligations have remaining terms less than one year 
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and require a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  revenue from direct system sales is earned pursuant to multiple element arrangements that require judgment in the areas of the separability of units of accounting  the fair value of individual elements  customer acceptance  and collectibility 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on a prospective basis 
the principles and guidance outlined in eitf no 
provide a framework to a determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and b determine how the arrangement consideration 
table of contents should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
we determined that our multiple element arrangements are generally comprised of the following elements that would qualify as separate units of accounting system sales  service  installation  and training 
each of these elements represents individual units of accounting as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered items  and arrangements generally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
we determine fair value based on the price of the undelivered element when it is sold separately or based on third party evidence 
in accordance with the guidance in eitf no 
 we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when we do not have fair value of the system sale 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for system sales when delivery and acceptance occurs  for installation and training when the services are rendered  and for service ratably over the service period  which is generally one year 
revenue from sales of replacement instruments and accessories is recognized upon delivery 
revenue related to future commitments under separately priced service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result 
similarly  management makes estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivables  especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
inventory write downs 
we write our inventory down for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
intangible assets 
we have intangible assets on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of computer motion and the acquisition of other patents 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates 
the evaluation of these intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on an ongoing basis 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
we conducted the required intangible assets impairment review during the fourth quarter of no impairment charge was recorded for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we impaired million of developed technology intangible assets related to a product for which futures sales were anticipated to be significantly lower than the original forecast  and million of trademark intangible assets and other intangible assets related to this product and to purchased software that has no future use 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in calculating this impairment charge  principally in determining market premiums and financial forecasts 
goodwill 
we have goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the acquisition of computer motion 
goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  rather is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each 
table of contents fiscal year more frequently if certain indicators are present 
in the event we determine that goodwill has been impaired  we will record an accounting charge for the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired at december  the quoted market price of our common stock was used to determine fair value for the impairment purpose 
our market capitalization continues to support the fair value of our reporting unit 
we are required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to these reporting units 
since we currently operate in one reportable segment  all of the goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
we completed the goodwill impairment tests and determined that the goodwill was not impaired at december  a considerable amount of judgment is required in calculating this impairment charge  principally in determining the reporting units 
warranties 
effective july   for certain arrangements recorded under the provisions of eitf no 
 actual warranty costs  which are not separable from other service costs  are expensed in the period incurred 
for all other revenue arrangements  we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
if warranty claim activity and the costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our products  patents and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which these deferred tax asset could be realized in the foreseeable future 
an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements see note under summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
factors affecting operating results our future operating results may be below securities analysts or investors expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
due to the nascent nature of our industry  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business 
the revenue and income potential of our market are unproven  and we may be unable to continue to generate significant revenues 
in addition  our costs may be higher than we anticipated 
if we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect  our results of operations will suffer 
further  future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to forecast because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving 
our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  actions relating to regulatory matters  
table of contents our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  demand for our products  the size and timing of particular sales and any collection delays related to those sales  product quality problems  the progress of surgical training in the use of our products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  third party payor reimbursement policies  our ability to protect our proprietary rights and defend against third party challenges  our ability to license additional intellectual property rights  and the progress and results of clinical trials 
our operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock  and the value of your investment  will likely decline 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our da vinci surgical system has a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
these factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low 
because of these fluctuations  it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the market price of our stock would likely decrease 
these fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance 
because a small number of customers have and are likely to continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer 
a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues came from the sales of da vinci surgical systems  which are high revenue dollar items 
during   and  no customer accounted for more than of total sales 
however  due to the high average selling price of the da vinci surgical system  our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our products could reduce our future revenues 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
if our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
the da vinci surgical systems and our other products represent a fundamentally new way of performing surgery 
achieving physician  patient and third party payor acceptance of intuitive surgery as a preferred method of performing surgery will be crucial to our success 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  hospitals will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
we believe that physicians and third party payors acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients 
physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing surgical techniques 
even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials  surgeons may elect not 
table of contents to use our products for any number of other reasons 
for example  cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional open heart surgery simply because such surgery is already widely accepted 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third party payors 
we expect that there will be a learning process involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products 
broad use of our products will require training of surgical teams 
market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training 
we may not be able to rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products 
because our markets are highly competitive  customers may choose to purchase our competitors products or may not accept intuitive surgery  which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share 
intuitive surgery is a new technology that will compete with established and emerging treatment options in both disease management and reconstructive medical procedures 
these competitive treatment options may take the form of traditional minimally invasive surgery  open surgery  interventional approaches  or pharmacological regimens 
some of these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and in many cases have a long history of use 
technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less expensive than using our products  which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
we cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will be competitive with current or future technologies 
in addition  we may face competition from companies that develop robotic and computer assisted surgical systems in the future 
our revenues may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our revenues will suffer 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors  especially those with greater resources 
international sales of our products account for a significant portion of our revenues  which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to successfully manage our international activities 
our business currently depends in large part on our activities in europe and other foreign markets 
sales to markets outside of the united states accounted for approximately   and of our sales for  and  respectively 
we are subject to a number of challenges that specifically relate to our international business activities 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets  and building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations 
currently  more than half of our international sales are denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful  which would limit the growth of our business 

table of contents if defects are discovered in our products  we may incur additional unforeseen costs  hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer 
our products incorporate mechanical parts  electrical components and computer software  any of which can contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced 
in addition  new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that  despite testing  are discovered only after commercial shipment 
because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures  we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects 
in the past  we have voluntarily recalled certain products as a result of performance problems 
we cannot assure you that our products will not experience errors or performance problems in the future 
if we experience flaws or performance problems  any of the following could occur delays in product shipments  loss of revenue  delay in market acceptance  diversion of our resources  damage to our reputation  product recalls  increased service or warranty costs  or product liability claims 
we may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
we have manufactured a limited number of our products for sales to customers 
we may be unable to maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing capacity 
even if this capacity can be maintained  the cost of doing so may increase the cost of our products and reduce our ability to compete 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of our products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply shortages  shortages of qualified personnel  and compliance with state  federal and foreign regulations 
manufacturing our products is a complex process 
if demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity  we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders 
if we are unable to maintain larger scale manufacturing capabilities  our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged 
our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or single source suppliers 
we purchase components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory 
the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components  which could affect our profitability 
a disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products  which could harm our ability to generate revenues  lead to customer 
table of contents dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products  we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines 
the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property contained in our products from use by third parties  our ability to compete in the market will be harmed 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in our products  and on successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property against third party challenges 
we will incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and  if necessary  defending our proprietary rights 
the patent positions of medical device companies  including ours  can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions 
we do not know whether we will obtain the patent protection we seek  or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged 
we also do not know whether we will be able to develop additional patentable proprietary technologies 
if we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property  or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated  others could use our intellectual property without compensating us  resulting in harm to our business 
we may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third party s products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings  including patent interferences or reexaminations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
others may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to engage in costly disputes and  if we are not successful in defending ourselves  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
there may be united states and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to computer assisted surgery  remote surgery  and minimally invasive surgery 
some of these patents may be broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our present technology  and may cover aspects of our future technology 
we do not know whether any of these patents  if challenged  would be held valid  enforceable and infringed 
from time to time  we receive  and likely will continue to receive  letters from third parties inviting us to license their patents 
we may be sued by  or become involved in an administrative proceeding with  one or more of these third parties 
we cannot assure you that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we may have concerning invalidity  unenforceability or noninfringement of any third party patent 
in addition to the issued patents of which we are aware  other parties may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering surgical products that are similar or identical to ours 
we cannot assure you that any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party will not cover our products or will not have priority over our patent applications 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies have employed such actions to gain a competitive advantage 
if third parties assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us  our technical and management personnel will experience a significant diversion of time and effort and we will incur large expenses defending our company 
if third parties in any patent action are successful  our patent portfolio may be damaged  we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  and we may be required to stop selling our products or obtain a license which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
we cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources or the substantive arguments to defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability  or to defend against allegations of infringement of third party patents 
in addition  any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us  or initiated or threatened against us  could cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents the rights and measures we rely on to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology  which could harm our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we typically rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights adequately  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in developing our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights  or may design around our proprietary technologies 
our products rely on licenses from third parties  and if we lose access to these technologies  our revenues could decline 
we rely on technology that we license from others  including technology that is integral to our products 
we have entered into license agreements with heartport  inc  now part of johnson johnson  ibm corporation  mit  olympus optical co  ltd  sri international  and brookhill wilk  llc 
any of these agreements may be terminated for breach 
if any of these agreements is terminated  we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms  or at all 
the loss or failure to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products 
the use of our products could result in product liability claims that could be expensive  divert management s attention and harm our business 
our business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims 
the medical device industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products were to cause injury or death 
there is also the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims 
particularly as sales of our products increase  we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
product liability claims have been made against our company in the past 
a product liability claim or any product recalls could also harm our reputation or result in a decline in revenues 
termination of relationships with former distributors of computer motion has resulted in breach of contract litigation 
as part of our integration strategy related to our acquisition of computer motion  we terminated computer motion s relationships with a number of companies that served as computer motion s distributors prior to the acquisition 
as a result  two former distributors one in italy and the other in israel have filed breach of contract suits against us 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation at this time and  therefore  cannot estimate the range of possible loss 
these proceedings could be expensive to litigate  may be protracted and computer motion s and or our confidential information may be compromised 
whether or not we are successful in these lawsuits  these proceedings could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
see item legal proceedings 

table of contents public announcements of litigation events may cause our stock price to decline 
during the course of our administrative proceedings and or lawsuits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
our products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory process 
if we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory approvals  we will not be able to market and sell our products in the united states 
our products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda regulates the research  testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  promotion  distribution and production of medical devices in the united states to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses 
in order for us to market certain products for use in the united states  we generally must first obtain clearance from the fda pursuant to section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  or ffdca 
clearance under section k requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with k clearance or grandfather status 
if we significantly modify our products after they receive fda clearance  the fda may require us to submit a separate k or premarket approval application  or pma  for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the us in addition  if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a device with k clearance or grandfather status  we will be required to obtain fda approval by submitting a pma 
the fda may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our k or pma submissions  or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain fda clearance or approval  all of which could delay or preclude sale of new products in the united states 
furthermore  the fda may request additional data or require us to conduct further testing  or compile more data  including clinical data and clinical studies  in support of a k submission 
the fda may also  instead of accepting a k submission  require us to submit a pma  which is typically a much more complex and burdensome application than a k 
to support a pma  the fda would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective 
we may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain k clearance or pma approval  or the fda may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals 
in addition  the fda may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition to a k clearance or pma approval 
product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following clearance or approval 
any delays or failure to obtain fda clearance or approvals of new products we develop  any limitations imposed by the fda on new product use  or the costs of obtaining fda clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a device  a company must  among other things  apply for and obtain institutional review board  or irb approval of the proposed investigation 
in addition  if the clinical study involves a significant risk as defined by the fda to human health  the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain fda approval of an investigational device exemption  or ide  application 
most of our products to date have been considered significant risk devices requiring ide approval prior to investigational use 
we may not be able to obtain fda and or irb approval to undertake clinical trials in the us for any new devices we intend to market in the united states in the future 
if we obtain such approvals  we may not be able to comply with the ide and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device 
failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents complying with fda regulations is an expensive and time consuming process  and our failure to comply fully could subject us to significant enforcement sanctions 
because our products  including the da vinci surgical system  are commercially distributed  numerous postmarket regulatory requirements apply  including the following quality system regulation  or qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process  labeling regulations  the fda s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved or off label uses  the reports of corrections and removals regulation  which requires that manufacturers report to the fda recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the ffdca that may pose a risk to health  and the medical device reporting regulation  which requires that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
we are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the fda to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply  it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a regulatory letter to a public warning letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions 
our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have modified the labeling  advertising and user training for the da vinci surgical system to call out specific procedures that we believe are within the scope of our existing k clearances 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance or that we have compiled adequate information to support the safety and efficacy of using the da vinci surgical system for all such specific procedures 
we also have modified the hardware and software in the da vinci surgical system since clearance in ways that we believe do not require new k clearance 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree with our determinations not to seek new k clearance for any of these changes 
computer motion also modified the hardware and software in its products subsequent to k clearance without seeking new clearance 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree with the determinations not to seek new k clearance for any of these changes 
the fda could impose enforcement sanctions and or require us to obtain k clearance for any modification to our products or computer motion s products 
we may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until such k clearance is granted 
in december  the fda inspected our sunnyvale manufacturing facility and issued a form fda setting forth three observed compliance deficiencies relating to the qsr and two observed deficiencies relating to the reports of corrections and removals regulation 
in january  we wrote to the fda indicating our response to each observation with proposed corrective actions 
that same month  the fda informed us that the adequacy of our promised corrections and actions would be verified during the next inspection of our facility 
to date  the fda has not returned for another inspection and we continue to evaluate and upgrade our qsr compliance 
we cannot assure you that  upon reinspection  the fda will find that our promised corrective actions are appropriate or that they have been adequately implemented 
we also cannot assure you that the fda will not find other deficiencies in our compliance with the qsr and other postmarket regulations 
in june  we acquired computer motion and have integrated its fda compliance quality system into our own 
as a result of the integration and review  we identified that computer motion has had deficiencies in complaint handling  mdr reporting and corrections and removals reporting in the last several years that required submission of retroactive reports to the fda 
we reported mdrs and we believe that our reporting decisions regarding these complaints is conservative in part because many of the complaints likely would not 
table of contents have been reportable if more information had been available 
also  to our knowledge  none of the reported events resulted in a death or serious injury  prolonged hospitalization  or medical intervention to prevent death or serious injury 
computer motion did respond to complaint trends  and it addressed the trends through corrective actions 
accordingly  the incidence of many of the types of events in the reports had been mitigated by june our review also suggests that significant complaint trends identified by computer motion over the period of four years were addressed by corrective actions  which have proven to be effective over time 
computer motion s product modifications were completed without k clearance and we believe that they do not require new k clearance 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree with our determinations not to seek new k clearance for any of these changes 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not seek to impose enforcement sanctions on us for computer motion violations preceding our acquisition of computer motion  that the fda will agree that since the acquisition we have corrected all regulatory problems  or that our review of computer motion s complaint handling will not lead us to initiate recalls or field actions to remedy problems with computer motion products already in the field 
our products are subject to various international regulatory processes and approval requirements 
if we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international regulatory approvals  we will not be able to market and sell our products in foreign countries 
to be able to market and sell our products in other countries  we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries 
these regulations  including the requirements for approvals and the time required for regulatory review  vary from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive  and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products  our ability to generate revenue will be harmed 
the european union requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the ce mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the european union 
the ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
in order to obtain the right to affix the ce mark to products  a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes meet certain european quality standards 
in january  we received permission to affix the ce mark to our da vinci surgical system and endowrist instruments 
if we modify existing products or develop new products in the future  including new instruments  we may need to apply for permission to affix the ce mark to such products 
in addition  we will be subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the ce mark permissions we have already obtained 
we do not know whether we will be able to obtain permission to affix the ce mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the permissions we have already received 
if we are unable to maintain permission to affix the ce mark to our products  we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the european union 
if institutions or surgeons are unable to obtain reimbursement from third party payors for procedures using our products  or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business 
domestic institutions will typically bill the services performed with our products to various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans 
if hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for procedures performed with our products  or if government and private payors policies do not permit reimbursement for surgical procedures performed using our products  we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 
our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for reimbursement through government sponsored health care payment systems and third party payors 
reimbursement practices vary significantly by 
table of contents country 
many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures 
other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures 
market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in any country within a particular time 
in addition  health care cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the united states are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our products and these efforts are expected to continue 
if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal  state or european manufacturing standards  we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations  which could result in product delivery delays and lost revenue 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated by the fda for compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements contained in the fda s quality system regulations  or qsr 
we are also required to comply with international organization for standardization  or iso  quality system standards in order to produce products for sale in europe 
if we fail to continue to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements or iso standards  we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations 
we are currently in compliance with iso standards 
the fda inspected our mountain view and sunnyvale facilities in march and december  respectively 
the good manufacturing practice issues raised by the fda during the inspections either were satisfactorily resolved with the fda  or we believe can be resolved by us to the fda s satisfaction  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we continue to be subject to fda inspections at any time 
maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly 
we cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements or iso standards in future inspections and audits by regulatory authorities 
the fda inspected the goleta facilities of computer motion in and noted deficiencies in computer motion s systems for reviewing and reporting product related complaints and defect information 
we have determined that these deficiencies may not have been addressed 
while the goleta manufacturing facility has been closed and production of certain product has been transferred to our sunnyvale facility  these issues raised by the fda must nonetheless be resolved 
the complaint records prior to acquisition of computer motion were reviewed and appropriate medical device reports were filed with the fda 
complaints received subsequent to our acquisition of computer motion are handled in accordance with intuitive surgical quality system requirements  which we believe is in accordance with fda requirements  although we cannot assure you that fda will agree  nor can we assess what regulatory impact  if any  this may have on our company 
as required  we are licensed by the state of california to manufacture medical devices 
we are subject to periodic inspections by the california department of health services and  if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections  we will be unable to manufacture or ship any products 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
our product development plans depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in mechanics  software and optics 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success  and competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies  and universities 
the loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not subject to any meaningful market risks related to currency  commodity prices or similar matters 
we are sensitive to short term interest rate fluctuations to the extent that such fluctuations impact the interest income we receive on the investment of our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

table of contents the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily include auction rate securities with rates that re set generally every days 
the weighted average maturity of all of our fixed rate investments as of december  was approximately one and a half years 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our fixed rate investment portfolio was composed of investments with maturities of one year or less 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that may be subject to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands as of december  as of december  weighted average interest rate fair value weighted average interest rate fair value variable rate securities marketable securities fixed rate mature in fixed rate mature in fixed rate mature in fixed rate mature in fixed rate mature in fluctuations in interest rates would also impact interest expense on future fixed rate notes payable for equipment financing contracts  should we elect to finance future equipment purchases
