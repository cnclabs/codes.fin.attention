item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the following management s discussion and analysis contains various forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to those identified below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking 
table of contents statements  which speak only as of their dates 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated weather  supply and demand of commodities including grains  fertilizer and other basic raw materials  market prices for grains and the potential for increased margin requirements  environmental and governmental policies  competition  economic conditions  risks associated with acquisitions  interest rates  and income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
note of the consolidated financial statements in item more fully describes our significant accounting policies  however  following are those accounting policies that management considers most critical to the company s financial statements 
grain inventories the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the grain inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in market value are recorded as merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
because the company marks to market inventories and sales commitments  gross profit on a grain sale transaction is recognized when a contract for sale of the grain is executed 
the related revenue is recognized upon shipment of the grain  at which time title transfers and customer acceptance occurs 
grain inventories contain valuation reserves established to recognize the difference in quality and value between contractual grades and actual quality grades of inventory held by the company 
these quality reserves also require management to exercise judgment 
marketing agreement the company has negotiated a marketing agreement that covers certain of its grain facilities certain of which are leased from cargill 
under this five 
table of contents year amended and restated agreement ending in may  the company sells grain from these facilities to cargill at market prices 
income earned from operating the facilities including buying  storing and selling grain and providing grain marketing services to its producer customers over a specified threshold is shared with cargill 
measurement of this threshold is made on a cumulative basis and cash is paid to cargill if required at each contract year end 
the company recognizes its share of income to date at each month end and accrues for any payment to cargill in accordance with emerging issues task force topic d  accounting for management fees based on a formula 
the adoption of this standard  effective for periods beginning after january   resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment increase of million after tax in derivatives commodity contracts the company utilizes regulated commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its market price exposure on the grain it owns and related forward purchase and sale contracts 
these contracts are included in the balance sheet in inventory at their current market value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses in the market value of these futures and option contracts are included in the income statement as a component of sales and merchandising revenues 
while the company considers all of its commodity contracts to be effective economic hedges  the company does not designate its commodity futures and options contracts as hedges 
therefore  the company does not defer gains and losses on these same contracts as would occur for designated hedges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
both the underlying inventory and forward purchase and sale contracts and the related futures and options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis 
impairment of long lived assets the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or rolling stock 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets that may be impacted 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all full time employees with pension benefits and postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the 
table of contents expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
the company uses third party specialists to assist management in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
certain accounting guidance  including the guidance applicable to pensions and postretirement benefits  does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  the net amount is disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item at december   we had an unrecognized loss related to our pension plans of million compared to an unrecognized loss of million at december  for the postretirement benefit plans  our december  unrecognized loss was million as compared to an unrecognized loss of million at december  a portion of the december  unrecognized loss for both pension and postretirement benefits will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years after will depend in large part on the actual experience of the plans in and beyond 
in  benefits expense included million and million of amortization of the unrecognized loss existing at december  for the pension and postretirement plans  respectively 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for the sales of its products at the time of shipment 
gross profit on sales of grain is recognized when sales contracts are entered into as the company marks its contracts to the market on a daily basis 
revenues from other merchandising activities are recognized as open grain contracts are marked to market or as related services are provided 
rental revenues on operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
sales returns and allowances  if required  are provided for at the time sales are recorded 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
the company sells railcars to financial intermediaries and other customers 
proceeds from railcar sales  including railcars sold in non recourse transactions  are recognized as revenue at the time of sale if there is no leaseback or the operating lease is assigned to the buyer  non recourse to the company 
revenue on operating leases where the company is the lessor and on servicing and maintenance contracts in non recourse transactions is recognized over the term of the lease or service contract 

table of contents leasing activities the company accounts for its leasing activity in accordance with fasb statement no 
 as amended  and related pronouncements 
the company s rail segment leases and manages railcars for third parties and leases railcars for internal use 
most leases to rail segment customers are structured as operating leases 
railcars leased by the company to its customers are either owned by the company  leased from financial intermediaries under operating leases or leased from financial intermediaries under capital leases 
the leases from financial intermediaries are generally structured as sale leaseback transactions 
lease income and lease expense are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease for most leases 
as part of its acquisition of railroad rolling stock and leasing assets from progress energy and subsidiaries  the company acquired some existing leases where the monthly lease fee is contingent upon some measure of usage per diem leases 
this monthly usage is tracked  billed and collected by third party service providers and funds are generally remitted to the company along with usage data three months after they are earned 
the company records lease revenue for these per diem arrangements based on recent historical usage patterns and records a true up adjustment when the actual data is received 
revenues recognized under per diem arrangements totaled million in there were no per diem arrangements prior to the company periodically finances some of its railcars through leases with a financial intermediary  the terms of which require the company to capitalize the assets and record the net present value of the lease obligation on its balance sheet as a long term borrowing 
there are no gains or losses on these financing transactions 
the obligation is included with the company s long term debt as described in note to the consolidated annual financial statements in item railcars under these leases are being depreciated to their residual value over the term of the lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to financial intermediaries and assigns the related operating lease on a non recourse basis 
the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediaries  and receives a fee for such services when earned 
on the date of sale  the company recognizes the proceeds from sales of railcars in non recourse lease transactions as revenue 
management and service fees are recognized as revenue as the underlying services are provided  which is generally spread evenly over the lease term 
taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing 
table of contents facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item 
new accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only 
the standard is effective for the company as of july  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of this standard and will begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of for  pro forma disclosure in note to the consolidated financial statements in item showed a decrease in diluted earnings per share of which was calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
while this may approximate the full year impact of adoption of this standard  the company has not finalized its decision on the valuation model and has proposed a new long term compensation plan to its shareholders which could result in a different annual impact upon adoption 
in november  fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  this standard does not have a material impact to the company s financial statements 
operating results the following discussion focuses on the operating results as shown in the consolidated statements of income

grain sales decreased million resulted from a decrease in the average price of bushels sold partially offset by a volume increase 
corn volume and price per bushel increased but volume in soybeans  wheat and oats declined 
in both and  grain expected to ship in the following calendar year was shipped in the fourth quarter 
this occurred because of increased demand and or market prices favoring sales rather than storage of grain 
fertilizer sales were up million  or  due to an increase in the average price per ton sold and an increase in volume 
much of the price increase relates to escalation in prices of the basic raw materials  primarily potassium and nitrogen 
generally  these increases can be passed through to customers although a price increase may also reduce consumer demand at the producer level 
revenues in both grain and fertilizer businesses are significantly impacted by the market price of the commodities being sold 
merchandising revenues in the agriculture group were up million  or  due primarily to increased space income before interest charges in the grain division 
space income is income earned on grain held for our account or for our customers and includes storage fees earned and appreciation or depreciation in the value of grain owned 
grain 
table of contents on hand at december  was million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
the harvest results were strong in the company s market area for both corn and soybeans 
corn production in ohio  indiana  illinois and michigan exceeded the production by and soybean production in the same states exceeded production by 
although the wheat production for was down as compared to  it exceeded the company s initial expectations 
the company received more grain in than for all grain types 
despite this strong harvest  demand continued and the company was able to sell grain throughout the fourth quarter  some of which was expected to be sold in the first quarter of winter wheat acres planted in for harvest in are down 
the company doesn t expect the crop volume to be repeated in  however  with good weather during the spring planting season  it could still be a very good year 
the company has also announced that it is considering construction of a million gallon per year ethanol production facility 
one of the possible sites is adjacent to its albion  michigan grain facility 
cost to construct this facility could approximate million and the company expects investment by one or more minority investors 
any project is subject to board approval 
the company is looking at several other possibilities to gain entry into the ethanol industry and has board of director approval to invest up to million in iroquois bio energy llc  which expects to begin construction on an ethanol production facility in the spring of the company also holds a contract for corn origination and risk management services for this proposed facility 
the company is continuing its investigation into possible opportunities in the ethanol industry and may increase its involvement in through additional investments in stand alone facilities  investments in holding companies or contracts to provide services to new or existing facilities 
if the proposed growth of the ethanol industry occurs  it could impact the company s grain business in potentially significant ways 
it is expected to increase demand for corn  with resulting higher prices and increased competition for corn 
in certain situations  our grain business could be negatively impacted if there are new nearby ethanol plants constructed to compete for locally available corn 
conversely  providing grain origination services and distillers dried grain marketing services to the ethanol industry is a potential growth opportunitiy for our grain trading operations

the new long term debt obtained as part of the railcar acquisition described earlier is securitized by the assets held by three wholly owned bankruptcy remote entities 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its cbot futures contracts 
conversely  in periods of declining prices  the company receives a return of cash

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company follows a policy of hedging its inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the instruments used are exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options hedges  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 
table of contents hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december in thousands net long position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of less than carrying value market risk
