item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future uncertainties the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which appear elsewhere in the annual report on form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we consider the following to be the most important matters on which management focuses in evaluating our operating performance and financial condition 
revenue growth 
we believe that revenue growth is the key factor affecting our results of operations 
our revenues have historically consisted of royalties and up front licensing fees 
in  we recognized a majority of our revenues from sales of our safety huber needle 
our arrangement regarding the sale of the safety huber needle  under which we have contracted for manufacture and distribution of the product and purchased the sublicense rights to the intellectual property  provides us with an expanded safety product line and provides greater potential for per unit revenues than would be the case with a licensed product 
we believe our short term revenue growth will largely be dependent on our ability to gain market share in the expanding safety huber needle market and the efforts of bd in selling products incorporating technology licensed from us 
sales of the safety huber needle in were below management s expectations 
we evaluated the realization of the acquired license rights under sfas and concluded that there was sufficient undiscounted cash flows to support the carrying value amount 
the current fair value of the acquired license rights is less than the carrying value 
we will continue to evaluate the realization of the assets and record an impairment charge if necessary 
management continues to provide the distributor of our safety huber needle with sales assistance and other support in an effort to increase sales of the safety huber needle 
we cannot assure that this effort will achieve meaningful success 
the extent to which bd commits its resources to the sale of our licensed technology products is entirely within bd s control 
management has been disappointed with the pace of commercialization of these products in the past and has encouraged bd to accelerate its efforts 
in this regard  although license revenues from bd have increased  all of such revenues constitute minimum royalties 
although management is encouraged by the growth in sales of the bd vacutainertm push button blood collection set and the limited launch of the ml version of the integratm syringe in february  management expected greater revenues to be generated in  and the fact that med design is paid only minimum royalties underscores the limited market penetration of these new products 
we receive royalties from the sale of the safety seldinger device from enpath medical  inc royalties from this product were approximately  in and declined to approximately  in enpath medical  inc s major customer decided to use a non safety version of seldinger  and sales declined significantly 
on december   we entered into addendum number two to the development and licensing agreement with enpath medical  inc for the safety seldinger device to eliminate the minimum purchase requirement to maintain exclusivity 
we expect the future royalties from this product will decrease significantly 
management was also disappointed with the sales of the shot safety dental syringe 
this product  which med design has contract manufactured  was launched in june revenue was approximately  in  and declined to approximately  in management is attempting to assist sultan chemists  the product s distributor  with its efforts to increase sales through alternative marketing channels as well as a campaign to increase the awareness of safety legislation through lobbyists 
in addition to the efforts of management to increase sales of the safety huber needle and the shot safety dental syringe  management is focused on increasing revenues by entering into additional collaborative arrangements and possibly by acquiring complementary businesses 
we rely on our licensees to provide us with sales information in order to calculate the royalties due to us as a result of sales 
while we have to date relied on this sales information without independent verification  we are currently developing appropriate procedures to verify this information in the future and will have such information audited when we deem it appropriate 
liquidity 
we have historically generated cash principally from issuances of equity and up front licensing fees 
in  revenue from sales of the safety huber needle and the minimum royalty payments from bd also contributed cash but considerably less than necessary to support operations 
although we believe that our cash on hand is sufficient to support ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months  our ultimate success depends on our ability to generate sufficient revenues to support operations 
if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to support operations  we will likely have to rely upon debt or equity financing 
there is no assurance we will be able to obtain such financing 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue was  in  as compared to revenue of  in revenue in reflects  in sales of the safety huber needle  all of which occurred after our acquisition of the safety huber needle business in april  royalties of  from bd and  from enpath medical  inc and  from sales of theshot safety dental syringe 
revenue in reflected sales of the shot safety dental syringe of  and royalty payments from the sale of our licensed products of  product costs  which consist of  direct and indirect costs related to our contract manufactured products  the amortization of the investment in acquired licensed products of  consulting expense of  and a write off of inventory obsoleted due to design change of  were  for the period ended december  product costs for the period ended december  consisted of direct and indirect costs related to the safety dental syringe sales of  general and administrative expenses were  in  a decrease of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of charges for stock based compensation of  offset by increases in professional and technical fees and audit fees of approximately  related to implementing internal controls principally to effect compliance with the applicable provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
research and development expenses were  in  a decrease of  as compared to research and development expenses of  in the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in expenditures for employee compensation resulting from a reduction in work force 
we have focused our r d activities on design changes to our current portfolio driven by the preferences expressed by potential customers  and therefore are comfortable reducing employee related expenditures 
investment income was  in  a decrease of  as compared to  in the decrease was due to a decrease in invested cash resulting from the purchase of the assets of the safety huber needle business 
realized loss on investments were  for the year ended december  we sold fixed income securities which yielded lower rates of interest to avoid further deterioration of our portfolio in a rising interest market 
the securities were sold in september at a loss of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue was  in  as compared to revenue of  in revenue in reflected the sales of the shot safety dental syringe as well as royalty payments under our licensing agreements  including  in minimum royalty payments from bd and enpath medical  inc revenue in also reflected royalty payments from the sale of our licensed products 
general and administrative expenses were  in  a decrease of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of expenditures for employee compensation of approximately  resulting from a reduction in staff  legal expense reductions of approximately  professional cost decreases of approximately  and stock based compensation decreases of approximately  offset by an increase in bad debt expense of  research and development expenses were  in  a decrease of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in the decrease is partially attributable to a  charge recorded in december resulting from the settlement of a claim by our former director of research and development and consulting costs of approximately  in related to the implementation of a quality program required for companies engaged in the manufacture of medical devices 
investment income was  in  an increase of  as compared to  in the increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately  in invested cash in in  we recorded an impairment charge on our investment in enpath medical inc formerly medamicus of  liquidity and capital resources in  our principal sources of cash were  of royalties from the sale of our licensed products   from the sale of our contract manufactured products and the net sale of investment securities of  however available for sale securities decreased by  from to in our principal sources of cash were the net proceeds of approximately  from our august private placement of common stock  the  of cash generated from our sale of enpath medical  inc common stock  and royalties of  from the sale of our licensed products 
additionally  in  our principal source of cash was the net proceeds of approximately  from our march private placement of common stock 
our primary uses of cash in consisted of general and administrative costs  including cash payments of  for salaries and research and development costs and the purchase of the safety huber needle business of  general and administrative costs in included cash payments of  for salaries and research and development costs 
general and administrative costs in included cash payments of  for salaries and research and development costs 
at december   we had a  revolving line of credit at wachovia bank under which borrowings would be collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
this facility can be used to fund working capital needs and finance capital equipment purchases  however  advances for capital equipment financing may not exceed  any borrowings to meet working capital needs will bear interest at libor plus  while borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
there were no borrowings under this facility during and the wachovia facility expires on may  on march   we established an additional revolving line of credit under which we may borrow up to  with us bank 
the facility is collateralized by our investments in us bank 
any borrowing would bear interest at libor plus 
there are no financial covenants 
the facility expires on march  and there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating a continuation of the availability of the line of credit or terms that will be available to us 
there are no amounts outstanding under the agreement 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of  as compared to  at we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
the availability of resources over a longer term will be dependent on our ability to increase sales of our manufactured products and royalty payments we receive from our licensees  enter into new licensing agreements  enter into and profitably operate under collaborative arrangements  and raise additional equity or debt financing 
we have not generated sufficient cash flows from operations to support our operations on an on going basis and anticipate that we may need to seek additional sources of funding in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating additional agreements  or if licensing revenues and revenues from sales of our manufactured products are insufficient to support our operations  we may be required to reduce the scope of  or cease  our operations 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following payments due by period total less than year years years operating lease obligations     employment agreement obligations    purchase obligations   obligations under luther agreement    consulting agreement luther    consulting agreement donegan    total     during  we renewed our lease for office space in ventura  california

med design began to pay mr 
donegan an aggregate of  of which  remains to be paid in bi weekly installments through november  with the remaining balance of  to be paid in bi weekly installments from november  to november  in addition  through november   med design continued to provide medical and life coverage for mr 
donegan

med design also agreed to continue to pay  through april    per month to cover mr 
donegan s rent and utilities  and agreed to provide all benefits accrued or earned as of the date of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
patents 
med design capitalizes costs incurred in connection with patent acquisitions and patent applications 
these costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the patents  not to exceed the legal life 
the statutory legal life of a patent is years from the date of application 
the carrying value of the patents are regularly reviewed by management for impairments whenever events or changes and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairments  if any  are recognized when the expected future cash flows derived from the patent is less than the carrying value 
the estimates of useful lives of the patents and expected future cash flows are based on a number of factors including product demand  market conditions  technology developments and the activities of our competitors 
med design does not believe that the value of any of its patents are impaired and does not believe that it is likely that there will be a change in the future 
historically  med design has never recorded an impairment to the value of its patent portfolio 
if future events or evaluations cause management to conclude that the value of one or more patents is impaired  we may recognize significant losses  and our financial condition may be negatively affected  in the future 
investment in acquired license rights 
we acquired the safety huber needle business of luther needlesafe products  inc we amortized the acquired license rights over years  which represents both the term of the sublicense agreement and the expiration date related to the patent 
the carrying value of the investment and the related estimated remaining lives are evaluated at each balance sheet date 
an impairment or charge in useful life would be recorded whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
we test long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  for recoverability whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist  we evaluate the recoverability by determining whether the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset cover the carrying value at the evaluation date 
if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we measure any impairment loss as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we conduct a review for impairment of goodwill at least annually 
additionally  on an interim basis  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends or a decline in a company s stock price for a sustained period 
estimates of recovery of carrying values of long lived assets and goodwill are based on a number of assumptions which may not prove to be correct 
in addition  it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying values of our long lived assets and goodwill are not impaired  there can be no assurance that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are reported at a fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the net unrealized gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining if a decline in market value below cost for a publicly traded security is other than temporary  we evaluate the relevant market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
factors involved in the determination of potential impairment include fair value as compared to amortized cost  length of time the value has been below amortized cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
moreover  if management s evaluation is not correct  we may recognize significant impairment losses in later periods 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and require management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
to satisfy the criteria  we input orders based upon receipt of a customer purchase order  record revenue upon shipment of goods when risk of loss and title transfer under our arrangements with customers or otherwise complying with the terms of the purchase order  confirm pricing through the customer purchase order and  validate creditworthiness through past payment history  credit agency reports and other financial data 
other than through warranty rights  our customers do not have explicit or implicit rights of return 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the revenue recognition criteria are not met for certain future transactions  such as a determination that an outstanding account receivable has become uncollectible  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
income taxes 
med design accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets where it appears more likely than not that we will not recover the deferred tax asset 
we experienced an ownership change as defined by internal revenue code section in losses incurred through january  amounting to million are generally limited in their utilization to million per year 
it is possible that recent ownership changes may result in further limitations under section new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas amends apb opinion to eliminate the similar productive asset exception and establishes that exchanges of productive assets should be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis unless neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits  the transaction is an exchange transaction to facilitate sales to customers  or the transaction lacks commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas are effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes that employee services received in exchange for share based payment result in a cost that should be recognized in the income statement as an expense when the services are consumed by the enterprise 
it further establishes that those expenses be measured at fair value determined as of the grant date 
the provisions of sfas r become effective in the third quarter of we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation in accounting for our stock plans 
we had adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards n accounting for stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas r is expected to increase stock based compensation 
we are currently assessing the impact of the accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit at december  if we were to borrow under our credit facility  borrowings to meet working capital needs would bear interest at libor plus and borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as a result  any such borrowings would be subject to interest rate fluctuations which could increase our interest expense  respectively 
we invest a portion of excess cash in marketable securities in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors 
these investments include corporate debt securities and us government and agencies securities 
these investments are in highly liquid  low risk securities where our risk of loss is at a minimum
