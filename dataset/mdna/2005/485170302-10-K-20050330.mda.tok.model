item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this form k is incorporated by reference in partial response to this item rail network owned network kcsr owns and operates approximately  miles of main and branch lines and  miles of other tracks in a ten state region that includes missouri  kansas  arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  louisiana  texas and illinois 
kcsr has the shortest north south rail route between kansas city and several key ports along the gulf of mexico in alabama  louisiana  mississippi and texas 
kcsr s rail route includes the meridian speedway  linking meridian  mississippi and dallas  texas  and the east west route linking kansas city with east st 
louis  illinois and springfield  illinois 
in addition  kcsr has limited haulage rights between springfield and chicago that allow for originating or terminating shipments on the rail lines of the former gateway western railway company gateway western 
the former gateway western lines also provide access to east st 
louis and allow rail traffic to avoid the st 
louis  missouri terminal 
the geographic reach of kcsr provides service to a diverse customer base that includes electric generating utilities  which use coal  and a wide range of companies in the chemical and petroleum  agricultural and mineral  forest products and metals  and automotive industries 
kcsr has also been very active in developing intermodal traffic 
eastern railroads and their customers can use our rail network to bypass the gateways at chicago  st 
louis  memphis  tennessee and new orleans  louisiana by interchanging with kcsr at springfield and 
table of contents east st 
louis and at meridian and jackson  mississippi 
other railroads can also interconnect with our rail network via other gateways at kansas city  missouri  birmingham  alabama  shreveport and new orleans  louisiana  and dallas  beaumont and laredo  texas 
kcsr revenues and net income are dependent on providing reliable service to customers at competitive rates  the general economic conditions in the geographic region served and the ability to effectively compete against other rail carriers and alternative modes of transportation  such as over the road truck transportation and barges 
the ability of kcsr to maintain the roadway in order to provide safe and efficient transportation service is important to its ongoing viability as a rail carrier 
additionally  cost containment is important in maintaining a competitive market position  particularly with respect to employee costs  as approximately of kcsr s employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
tex mex on august   kcs entered into an agreement with tfm to purchase mexrail shares representing ownership of mexrail for approximately million 
the mexrail shares were placed in a voting trust pending regulatory approval by the surface transportation board stb of kcs s common control of tex mex  kcsr and the gateway eastern railway company gateway eastern 
on november   the stb approved kcs s application for authority to control tex mex and the us portion of the international rail bridge at laredo 
that authority became final on december  on january   the shares representing of mexrail were released from the voting trust to kcs  and kcs took control of tex mex 
under this agreement  kcs has an exclusive option to purchase from tfm on or before october  the remaining of the shares of mexrail 
if kcs does not exercise this option by october   kcs becomes obligated to purchase such remaining shares on october  at a purchase price of approximately million 
tex mex connects to kcsr through trackage rights over the rail lines of the union pacific railroad company up between robstown  texas and beaumont 
these trackage rights were granted pursuant to a stb decision and have an initial term of years 
on march   tex mex purchased from up a line of railroad right of way extending miles between rosenberg  texas and victoria  texas  and granted tex mex trackage rights to access the line from the existing trackage rights 
the line is not in service  but extensive reconstruction is still being planned 
once reconstruction of the line is completed  tex mex will be able to shorten its existing route between corpus christi and houston  texas by over miles 
significant investments grupo tfm in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement with transportaci n mar tima mexicana  sa de sa  currently known as grupo tmm  sa tmm to  among other things  provide for participation in the privatization of the mexican national railway system and to promote the movement of rail traffic over tex mex  tfm and kcsr 
pursuant to written notice given by tmm  and in accordance with its terms  the joint venture agreement was terminated on december  in  we invested million to obtain a interest in grupo tfm  the company formed by kcs and tmm under the joint venture agreement for the purpose of participating in the privatization of the mexican national railway system 
at the time that grupo tfm purchased of the shares of tfm  tmm  the largest shareholder of grupo tfm  owned of grupo tfm and the mexican government owned the remaining of grupo tfm 
in  kcs and tmm exercised their call option on the mexican government s grupo tfm shares and  on july   tfm completed the purchase of the mexican government s ownership of grupo tfm 
the million purchase price was funded utilizing a combination of proceeds from an offering of debt securities by tfm  a credit from the mexican government for the reversion of certain rail facilities and other resources 
this transaction increased our ownership percentage of grupo tfm from to approximately 
grupo tfm owns of the stock of tfm which represents all of the shares entitled to full voting rights  while the remaining of tfm with limited voting rights is owned by the mexican government 

table of contents tfm holds the concession  which was awarded by the mexican government in  to operate mexico s northeast rail lines the concession  the northeast rail lines are now known as tfm for years ending in june subject to certain conditions  tfm has an option to extend the concession for an additional years 
the concession is subject to certain mandatory trackage rights and is exclusive until the mexican government  however  may revoke tfm s exclusivity after if it determines that there is insufficient competition  and may terminate the concession as a result of certain conditions or events  including tfm s failure to meet its operating and financial obligations with regard to the concession under applicable mexican law  a statutory appropriation by the mexican government for reasons of public interest and liquidation or bankruptcy of tfm 
tfm s assets and its rights under the concession may  under certain circumstances such as natural disaster  war or other similar situations  also be seized temporarily by the mexican government 
under the concession  tfm operates a strategically significant corridor between mexico and the united states  and has as its core route a key portion of the shortest  most direct rail passageway between mexico city and laredo 
tfm s rail lines are the only ones which serve nuevo laredo  the largest rail freight exchange point between the united states and mexico 
tfm s rail lines connect the most populated and industrialized regions of mexico with mexico s principal us border railway gateway at laredo 
in addition  tfm serves three of mexico s primary seaports at veracruz and tampico on the gulf of mexico and lazaro cardenas on the pacific ocean 
tfm serves mexican states and mexico city  which together represent a majority of the country s population and account for a majority of its estimated gross domestic product 
tfm operates approximately  miles of main and branch lines and certain additional sidings  spur tracks and main line tracks under trackage rights 
tfm has the right to operate the rail lines through the concession  but does not own the land  roadway or associated structures 
through tex mex and kcsr  as well as through interchanges with other major us railroads  tfm provides its customers with access to an extensive rail network through which they may distribute their products throughout north america and overseas 
tfm is both a strategic and financial investment for kcs 
strategically  our investment in tfm promotes the nafta growth strategy  whereby we and our strategic partners can provide transportation services between the heart of mexico s industrial base  the united states and canada 
tfm s strategy is to provide reliable customer service  capitalize on foreign trade growth and convert truck tonnage to rail 
in doing so  tfm expects to establish its railroad as the primary inland freight transporter linking mexico to us and canadian markets along the nafta corridor 
tfm s operating strategy has been to increase productivity and maximize operating efficiencies 
with mexico s economic progress  growth of nafta trade between mexico  the united states and canada  and customer focused rail service  kcs management believes that the growth potential of tfm could be significant 
as further described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments kcs and tmm enter into amended acquisition agreement  on april   kcs and tmm entered into an agreement  referred to as the original acquisition agreement  for the acquisition by kcs of control of tfm the acquisition 
the original acquisition agreement was not consummated due to disputes arising between the parties which led to litigation and arbitration 
on december   kcs and tmm entered into an amended and restated acquisition agreement acquisition agreement amending and restating the original acquisition agreement 
pending closing under the acquisition agreement  kcs and tmm and certain affiliates operate under the may shareholders agreement 
the shareholders agreement  which governs our investment in grupo tfm restricts each of the parties to the shareholders agreement from directly or indirectly transferring any interest in grupo tfm or tfm to a competitor of grupo tfm  tfm or other parties without the prior written consent of each of the parties  and provides that kcs and tmm may not transfer control of any subsidiary holding all or any portion of shares of grupo tfm to a third party  other than an affiliate of the transferring party or another party to the shareholders agreement  without the consent of the other parties to the shareholders agreement 
the grupo tfm bylaws prohibit any transfer of shares of grupo tfm to any person other than an affiliate of the existing shareholders without the prior consent of grupo tfm s board of directors 
in addition  the grupo tfm bylaws grant the shareholders of grupo tfm a right of first refusal to acquire shares to be transferred by any other shareholder in proportion to the number of shares held by each 
table of contents non transferring shareholder  although holders of preferred shares or shares with special or limited rights are only entitled to acquire those shares and not ordinary shares 
the shareholders agreement requires that the boards of directors of grupo tfm and tfm be constituted to reflect the parties relative ownership of the ordinary voting common stock of grupo tfm 
under the terms of the january  share purchase agreement through which grupo tfm agreed to purchase the shares of tfm  as amended by the parties on june  the tfm share purchase agreement  the mexican government has the right to compel the purchase of its interest in tfm referred to as the put by grupo tfm following its compliance with the terms and conditions of the tfm share purchase agreement 
upon exercise of the put in accordance with the terms of the tfm share purchase agreement  grupo tfm would be obligated to purchase the tfm capital stock at the initial share price paid by grupo tfm adjusted for interest and inflation 
prior to october   grupo tfm filed suit in the federal district court of mexico city seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment interpreting whether grupo tfm was obligated to honor its obligation under the tfm share purchase agreement  as the mexican government had not made any effort to sell the tfm shares subject to the put prior to october  in its suit  grupo tfm named tmm and kcs as additional interested parties 
the mexican court has admitted grupo tfm s complaint and issued an injunction that blocked the mexican government from exercising the put 
the mexican government provided grupo tfm with notice of its intention to sell its interest in tfm on october  grupo tfm has responded to the mexican government s notice reaffirming its right and interest in purchasing the mexican government s remaining interest in tfm  but also advising the mexican government that it would not take any action until its lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment was resolved 
in the event that grupo tfm does not purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm  tmm and kcs  or either of tmm or kcs alone  would  following notification by the mexican government in accordance with the terms of the tfm share purchase agreement  be obligated to purchase the mexican government s remaining interest in tfm 
as this matter is currently the subject of litigation in mexico to which the mexican government  grupo tfm  tmm and kcs are parties  kcs management does not believe it is likely that the mexican government will seek to exercise the put until the litigation is resolved 
on completion of the acquisition  kcs will assume tmm s rights and obligations to make any payment upon the exercise by the mexican government of its right to compel the purchase of its interest in tfm in accordance with the applicable agreements and will indemnify tmm and its affiliates  and their respective officers  directors  employees and shareholders  against obligations or liabilities relating thereto 
panama canal railway company in january  the republic of panama awarded pcrc  a joint venture company formed by kcs and mi jack products  inc mi jack  the concession to reconstruct and operate the panama canal railway  a mile railroad located adjacent to the panama canal that provides international shippers with a railway transportation option to complement the panama canal 
the panama canal railway  which traces its origins back to the late s  is a north south railroad traversing the panama isthmus between the pacific and atlantic oceans 
the railroad has been reconstructed and resumed freight operations in december while only miles long  management believes the panama canal railway provides a unique opportunity to participate in transoceanic shipments as a complement to the existing panama canal traffic 
management believes the potential for this railroad is in the service of shipping customers who need to reposition containers between the ports of balboa and colon without passing through the canal 
in addition  there is demand for passenger traffic for both commuter and pleasure tourist travel 
panarail operates and promotes commuter and tourist passenger service over the panama canal railway 
passenger service started during july as of december   we have invested approximately million toward the reconstruction and operations of the panama canal railway 
this investment is comprised of million of equity and million of subordinated loans 
these loans carry a interest rate and are payable on demand  subject to certain restrictions 
in november  pcrc completed the financing for the reconstruction project with the international finance corporation ifc  a member of the world bank group 
the financing is comprised of a 
table of contents million investment by the ifc and senior loans through the ifc in an aggregate amount of up to million 
additionally  pcrc has million of equipment loans and other capital leases totaling million 
the ifc s investment of million in pcrc is comprised of non voting preferred shares which pay a cumulative dividend 
as of december   pcrc has recorded a million liability for these cumulative preferred dividends 
the preferred shares may be redeemed at the ifc s option any year after at the lower of a net cumulative internal rate of return of or eight times earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization for the two years preceding the redemption that is proportionate to the ifc s percentage ownership in pcrc 
on march   pcrc and the ifc finalized an agreement whereby pcrc would redeem the shares subscribed and owned by ifc pursuant to the ifc subscription 
under the agreement  pcrc will pay to the ifc million 
these shares have a recorded value of million and approximately million in accrued unpaid dividends 
when the transaction is completed  pcrc will record an additional cost of approximately million to reflect the premium paid to ifc and  as a result  kcs expects to record its share of this cost of approximately million in recording its equity in earnings of pcrc in the first quarter of under the terms of the loan agreement with ifc  we are a guarantor for up to million of the associated debt 
also if pcrc terminates the concession contract without the ifc s consent  kcs is a guarantor for up to of the outstanding senior loans 
kcs is also a guarantor for up to million of the equipment loans and approximately  relating to other capital leases 
the cost of the reconstruction totaled approximately million 
we expect to loan an additional million to pcrc during under the same terms as the existing million subordinated loans 
southern capital in  kcsr and gatx capital corporation gatx formed a joint venture southern capital to perform certain leasing and financing activities 
southern capital s operations consist primarily of the acquisition of locomotives  and other rail equipment and the leasing thereof to kcsr 
concurrent with the formation of this joint venture  kcsr entered into operating leases with southern capital for substantially all the locomotives and rolling stock that kcsr contributed or sold to southern capital at the time of formation of the joint venture 
gatx contributed cash in the joint venture transaction formation 
the purpose for the formation of southern capital was to partner a class i railroad in kcsr with an industry leader in rail equipment financing in gatx 
southern capital provides kcsr with access to equipment financing alternatives 
expanded network through our strategic alliance with cn ic and marketing agreements with norfolk southern  bnsf and the ic e  kcs has expanded the domestic geographic reach beyond that covered by its owned network 
strategic alliance with canadian national and illinois central 
in  kcsr  cn and ic entered into a year strategic alliance to coordinate the marketing  operations and investment elements of north south rail freight transportation 
this alliance connects canadian markets  the major midwest us markets of detroit  michigan  chicago  kansas city and st 
louis and the key southern markets of memphis  dallas and houston 
it also provides us and canadian shippers with access to mexico s rail system through connections with tex mex and tfm 
in addition to providing access to key north south international and domestic us traffic corridors  the alliance with cn ic is intended to increase business in all commodity groups and positioned kcs as a key provider of rail service for nafta trade 
kcsr and cn formed a management group made up of senior management representatives from both railroads to guide the realization of the alliance goals and develop plans for the construction of new facilities to support business development  including investments in automotive  intermodal and transload facilities at memphis  dallas  kansas city and chicago 

table of contents under a separate agreement  kcsr was granted certain trackage and haulage rights and cn and ic were granted certain haulage rights 
under the terms of this agreement  and through action taken by the stb  in kcsr gained access to six additional chemical customers in the geismar  louisiana industrial area through haulage rights 
marketing agreements with norfolk southern 
in december  kcsr entered into a marketing agreement with norfolk southern and tex mex that allows kcsr to increase its traffic volume along the east west corridor between meridian and dallas by using interchange points with norfolk southern 
this agreement provides norfolk southern run through service with access to dallas and the mexican border at laredo while avoiding the rail gateways of memphis and new orleans 
this agreement was renewed in december for a term of three years and will be automatically renewed for additional three year terms unless written notice of termination is given at least days prior to the expiration of the then current term 
in may  kcsr entered into an additional marketing agreement with norfolk southern under which kcsr provides haulage services for intermodal traffic between meridian and dallas in exchange for fees from norfolk southern 
under this agreement norfolk southern may quote rates and enter into transportation service contracts with shippers and receivers covering this haulage traffic 
under the current arrangement  which expires on december   trains run between kcsr s connection with norfolk southern at meridian and the bnsf connection at dallas 
the structure of the agreement provides for lower gross revenue to kcsr  but improved operating income since  as a haulage arrangement  locomotives  locomotive fuel and car hire expenses are the responsibility of norfolk southern  not kcsr 
marketing alliance with bnsf in april  kcsr and bnsf formed a comprehensive joint marketing alliance aimed at promoting cooperation  revenue growth and extending market reach for both railroads in the united states and canada 
the marketing alliance was also designed to improve operating efficiencies for both carriers in key market areas  as well as provide customers with expanded service options 
kcsr and bnsf have agreed to coordinate marketing and operational initiatives in a number of target markets 
the marketing alliance allows the two railroads to be more responsive to shippers requests for rates and service across the two rail networks 
coal and unit train operations are excluded from the marketing alliance  as well as any points where kcsr and bnsf are the only direct rail competitors 
movements to and from mexico by either party are also excluded 
management believes this marketing alliance provides shippers with enhanced options and competitive alternatives as well as opportunities to grow kcsr s revenue base  particularly in the chemical  grain and forest product markets through expanded access to important markets 
marketing agreement with ic e 
kcsr is a party to a marketing agreement with ic e 
this marketing agreement provides kcsr with access to minneapolis and chicago and to the origination of corn and other grain traffic in iowa  minnesota and illinois 
through this marketing agreement  kcsr receives and originates shipments of grain products for delivery to poultry industry feed mills on its network 
grain is currently kcsr s largest export into mexico 
this agreement can be terminated with days notice 
haulage rights 
as a result of the acquisition of the missouri kansas texas railroad by up  kcsr was granted haulage rights between kansas city and each of council bluffs  iowa  omaha and lincoln  nebraska and atchison and topeka  kansas  and a joint rate agreement for our grain traffic between beaumont and each of houston and galveston  texas 
kcsr has the right to convert these haulage rights to trackage rights 
kcsr s haulage rights require up to move kcsr traffic in up trains  trackage rights would allow kcsr to operate its trains over up tracks 
these rights have a term of years 
in addition  kcsr has limited 
table of contents haulage rights between springfield and chicago for shipments that originate or terminate on the former gateway western s rail lines 
markets served percentage of kcsr commodity group revenues in chemical and petroleum forest products and metals agricultural and mineral intermodal and automotive coal other chemical and petroleum kcsr transports chemical and petroleum products via tank and hopper cars primarily to markets in the southeast and northeast united states through interchanges with other rail carriers 
primary traffic includes plastics  petroleum and oils  petroleum coke  rubber  and miscellaneous chemicals 
kcsr s access to six additional chemical customers in the geismar  louisiana industrial corridor has resulted in additional revenue for kcsr and management believes it could provide future competitive opportunities for revenue growth as existing contracts with other rail carriers expire for these customers 
forest products and metals kcsr s rail lines run through the heart of the southeastern us timber producing region 
we believe that forest products made from trees in this region are generally less expensive than those from other regions due to lower production costs 
as a result  southern yellow pine products from the southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of western producers who have experienced capacity reductions because of public policy considerations 
kcsr serves paper mills directly and indirectly through short line connections 
primary traffic includes pulp and paper  lumber  panel products plywood and oriented strand board  engineered wood products  pulpwood  woodchips  raw fiber used in the production of paper  pulp and paperboard  as well as metal  scrap and slab steel  waste and military equipment 
slab steel products are used primarily in the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry  and military equipment is shipped to and from several military bases on kcsr s rail lines 
agricultural and mineral agricultural products consist of domestic and export grain  food and related products 
shipper demand for agricultural products is affected by competition among sources of grain and grain products  as well as price fluctuations in international markets for key commodities 
in the domestic grain business  kcsr s rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to feed mills serving the poultry industry 
through the marketing agreement with ic e  kcsr s rail lines have access to sources of corn and other grain in iowa and other midwestern states 
kcsr currently serves feed mills along its rail lines throughout arkansas  oklahoma  texas  louisiana  mississippi and alabama 
export grain shipments include primarily wheat  soybeans and corn transported to mexico via laredo and to the gulf of mexico for overseas destinations 
over the long term  export grain shipments are expected to increase as a result of mexico s reliance on grain imports 
food and related products consist mainly of soybean meal  grain meal  oils and canned goods  sugar and beer 
mineral shipments consist of a variety of products including ores  clay  stone and cement 

table of contents intermodal and automotive the intermodal freight business consists primarily of hauling freight containers or truck trailers by a combination of water  rail and motor carriers  with rail carriers serving as the link between the other modes of transportation 
through kcsr s dedicated intermodal train service between meridian and dallas  we compete directly with truck carriers along the interstate corridor 
the intermodal business is highly price sensitive and service driven as the trucking industry maintains certain competitive advantages over the rail industry 
trucks are not obligated to provide or maintain rights of way and do not have to pay real estate taxes on their routes 
in prior years  the trucking industry diverted a substantial amount of freight from railroads as truck operators efficiency over long distances increased 
in response to these competitive pressures  the railroad industry forged alliances with truck companies in order to move more traffic by rail and provide faster  safer and more efficient service to their customers 
kcsr has entered into agreements with several trucking companies for train service concentrated between dallas and meridian 
the strategic alliance with cn ic and marketing agreements with norfolk southern provide kcsr the opportunity to further capitalize on the growth potential of intermodal freight revenues  particularly for traffic moving between points in the upper midwest and canada to kansas city  dallas and mexico 
furthermore  kcsr is developing the former richards gebaur airbase in kansas city as a us customs pre clearance processing facility  the kansas city international freight gateway ifg  which is expected to handle and process large volumes of domestic and international intermodal freight 
through an agreement with mazda  kcsr has developed an automotive loading and distribution facility at ifg 
this loading and distribution facility became operational in april for the movement of mazda vehicles 
other automotive traffic consists primarily of vehicle parts moving into mexico from the northern sections of the united states and finished vehicles moving from mexico into the united states 
our rail network essentially serves as the connecting bridge carrier for these movements of automotive parts and finished vehicles 
coal coal historically has been one of the most stable sources of revenues and is the largest single commodity handled by kcsr 
substantially all coal customers are under long term contracts  which typically have an average contract term of approximately five years 
kcsr  directly or indirectly  delivers coal to ten electric generating plants  in  arkansas  texas  missouri  and louisiana 
principally all the coal kcsr transports originates in the powder river basin in wyoming and is transferred to kcsr s rail lines at kansas city 
other other rail related revenues include a variety of miscellaneous services provided to customers and interconnecting carriers 
major items in this category include railcar switching services  demurrage railcar retention penalties and drayage local truck transportation services 
railroad industry overview us railroad companies are categorized by the stb into three types class i  class ii regional and class iii local 
currently  there are seven class i railroads in the united states  which can be further divided geographically by eastern or western classification 
the eastern railroads are csx corporation csx  grand trunk corporation which is owned by cn and includes ic and wisconsin central transportation corporation wisconsin central and norfolk southern 
the western railroads include bnsf  kcsr  soo line railroad company owned by canadian pacific railway company cp and up 

table of contents the stb and regulation the stb  an independent body administratively housed within the department of transportation  is responsible for the economic regulation of railroads within the united states 
the stb s mission is to ensure that competitive  efficient and safe transportation services are provided to meet the needs of shippers  receivers and consumers 
the stb was created by an act of congress known as the icc termination act of iccta 
passage of the iccta represented a further step in the process of streamlining and reforming the federal economic regulatory oversight of the railroad  trucking and bus industries that was initiated in the late s and early s 
the stb is authorized to have three members  each with a five year term of office 
the stb chairman is designated by the president of the united states from among the stb s members 
the stb adjudicates disputes and regulates interstate surface transportation 
railway transportation matters under the stb s jurisdiction in general include railroad rate and service issues  rail restructuring transactions mergers  line sales  line construction and line abandonment and certain railroad labor matters 
railroad consolidation on june   the stb issued new rules governing major railroad mergers and consolidations involving two or more class i railroads 
these rules substantially increase the burden on rail merger applicants to demonstrate that a proposed transaction would be in the public interest 
the rules require applicants to demonstrate that  among other things  a proposed transaction would enhance competition where necessary to offset negative effects of the transaction  such as competitive harm  and to address fully the impact of the transaction on transportation service 
the stb recognized  however  that a merger between kcsr and another class i carrier would not necessarily raise the same concerns and risks as potential mergers between larger class i railroads 
accordingly  the stb decided that for a merger proposal involving kcsr and another class i railroad  the stb will waive the application of the new rules and apply the rules previously in effect unless it is persuaded that the new rules should apply 
competition our rail operations compete against other railroads  many of which are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources 
since  there has been significant consolidation among major north american rail carriers 
as a result of this consolidation  the railroad industry is now dominated by a few mega carriers 
we regard the larger western railroads bnsf and up  in particular  as significant competitors to our operations and prospects because of their substantial resources 
the ongoing impact of these mergers is uncertain 
we believe that because of our investments and strategic alliances  we are positioned to attract additional rail traffic through our rail network 
we are subject to competition from motor carriers  barge lines  and other maritime shipping  which compete across certain routes in operating areas 
truck carriers have eroded the railroad industry s share of total transportation revenues 
changing regulations  subsidized highway improvement programs and favorable labor regulations have improved the competitive position of trucks in the united states as an alternative mode of surface transportation for many commodities 
in the united states  the trucking industry generally is more cost and transit time competitive than railroads for short haul distances 
in addition  mississippi and missouri river barge traffic  among others  compete with kcsr and our rail connections in the transportation of bulk commodities such as grains  steel and petroleum products 
intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price sensitive competition  particularly from motor carriers 
however  rail carriers  including kcsr  have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working together with motor carriers and each other to provide end to end transportation of products 
while deregulation of freight rates has enhanced the ability of railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes of transportation  this increased competition has resulted in downward pressure on freight rates 
competition with other railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based on the rates charged  the quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality of the carrier s equipment for certain commodities 

table of contents employees and labor relations as of december   kcs and its subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
labor relations in the us railroad industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation under the railway labor act rla 
under the rla  national labor agreements are renegotiated when they become open for modification  but their terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached 
typically  neither management nor labor employees are permitted to take economic action until extended procedures are exhausted 
approximately of kcsr employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements with different labor organizations 
a negotiating process for new collective bargaining agreements representing all of kcsr s union employees has been in process since november  wages  health and welfare benefits  work rules and other issues have been negotiated on an industry wide scale 
previously  these negotiations  which can take place over significant periods of time  have not resulted in any extended work interruptions 
the existing agreements will remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the rla s procedures are exhausted 
until new agreements are reached  the current agreements provide for periodic wage adjustments 
railroad retirement act and railroad retirement improvement act railroad industry personnel are covered by the railroad retirement act rra instead of the social security act 
employer contributions under the rra are currently substantially higher than those under the social security act and may rise further because of the increasing proportion of retired employees receiving benefits relative to the number of working employees 
for  the rra required up to a contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages while the social security and medicare acts only require a employer contribution on similar wage bases 
of the the first component  tier is based on factors corresponding to the social security rates while tier currently is based on a formula 
under the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of rria  the formula method can produce a tier rate between and 
on december   the rria was signed into law 
this legislation liberalizes early retirement benefits for employees with years of service by reducing the full benefit age from to  eliminates a cap on monthly retirement and disability benefits  lowers the minimum service requirement from years to years of service  and provides for increased benefits for surviving spouses 
it also provides for the investment of railroad retirement funds in non governmental assets  adjustments in the payroll tax rates paid by employees and employers  and the repeal of a supplemental annuity work hour tax 
the rria reduced the employer contribution for payroll taxes by   and in  and  respectively 
railroad industry personnel are also covered by the federal employers liability act fela rather than state workers compensation systems 
fela is a fault based system with compensation for injuries settled by negotiation and litigation  which can be expensive and time consuming 
by contrast  most other industries are covered by state administered no fault plans with standard compensation schedules 
the difference in the labor regulations for the rail industry compared to the non rail industries illustrates the competitive disadvantage placed upon the rail industry by federal labor regulations 
insurance we maintain multiple insurance programs for our various subsidiaries including rail liability and property  general liability  directors and officers coverage  workers compensation coverage and various specialized coverage for specific entities as needed 
coverage for kcsr is by far the most significant part of our program 
it includes liability coverage up to million  subject to a million deductible and certain aggregate limitations  and property coverage up to million  subject to a million deductible million deductible in the event of flood or earthquake and certain aggregate limitations 
kcs management believes that our insurance program is in line with industry norms given our size and provides adequate coverage for potential losses
