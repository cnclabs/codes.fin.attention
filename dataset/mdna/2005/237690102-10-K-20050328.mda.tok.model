item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves as long as they identify these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results 
all statements other than statements of historical fact made in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
in particular  statements herein regarding industry prospects and trends  future results of operations or financial position  integration of acquired products and operations  market acceptance of our newly introduced or upgraded products  development  introduction and shipment of new products  establishing foreign operations  and any other guidance on future periods are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
although data i o believes that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance  achievements  or other future events 
moreover  neither data i o nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward looking statements 
data i o is under no duty to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this annual report 
the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the following discussions and the section entitled business cautionary factors that may affect future results describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview in  our primary goal was to focus on managing the business to achieve profitable operations  while developing and enhancing products to drive revenue and earnings growth 
our challenge continues to be operating in the uncertain economic environment  while positioning data i o to take advantage of an anticipated recovery in capital spending 
we experienced a fourth quarter decline in demand that we attribute to a seasonal slow down in capital spending 
we expect that demand for programming capacity should improve  in part based on third party forecasted increased unit sales for the semiconductor industry  which should provide improved business opportunities for data i o 
we are continuing our efforts to balance increasing costs and strategic investments in our business with the level of demand in and mix of business we expect 
we are focusing our research and development efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore architecture and the proline roadrunner and ps families 
during the third quarter of  we obtained the rights to certain in system programming isp technology 
we are incorporating this isp technology into our imagewriter product  and will be required to pay a royalty on product revenues associated with such technology until march  during the third quarter we had our first sale of our initial isp product and formally launched the imagewriter product in november 
the related royalties were not a material amount in to better support our customers in their geographic areas and time zones  we have expanded device support operations in germany and india and during the fourth quarter completed the set up of a new device support center in shanghai  china 
our customer focus has been on strategic high volume manufacturers and programming centers and supporting nand flash and microcontrollers on our newer products to gain new accounts and break into new markets  such as microcontrollers for the automotive market 
we are finalizing the operational set up for our new subsidiaries in china and brazil 
we expanded our china operations to take advantage of the growth of manufacturing in china and are establishing a service operation in brazil 
we also increased our efforts to recapture the japanese market and are considering establishing a subsidiary in japan 
we continue our efforts to partner with the semiconductor manufacturers to better serve our mutual customers 
during  data i o identified certain errors related to inter company profit eliminations and determined that the cumulative adjustments required to correct these errors were most appropriately corrected through restatement of previously issued financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  the restated amounts are reflected on this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of this restatement on previously issued financial statements 
business restructuring progress during  we took restructuring related charges of  primarily related to severance and a small office closure 
these actions were taken to lower production and operating costs to reduce the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point  particularly in view of our reduced margins in the second quarter of  the continued need to control costs in north america and europe  and the need to build staff serving china and eastern europe 
at december    remained as accrued but unpaid restructure charges  which will be paid in during  we completed the restructuring that began during  which included actions taken to reduce the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point and realign data i o with our market opportunities 
we required this operational repositioning because of the impact of the economic slowdown and the decline in capital spending across a high number of customer groups on general demand for programming equipment over the past few years 
at the end of  our quarterly level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point was at approximately million in net sales with employees worldwide 
our level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point increased in  primarily due to cost increases resulting from the impact of the weaker dollar on foreign currency based costs and from personnel costs due to raises  incentive compensation and selective hiring of individuals with critical skills to help position us as the continuing technology leader in our market 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of  in connection with our actions to reduce the level of revenue required for our quarterly net income breakeven point from approximately million of net sales at the beginning of to approximately million at the end of we achieved most of these reductions by reducing our personnel from at the beginning of to at the end of during  we recorded restructuring charges of  in connection with a number of strategic restructuring actions to reduce the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point 
this restructuring included the following a reduction in our global workforce from at the start of the year to at the end of  discontinuance or reallocation of numerous projects and activities not essential to our long term goals  streamlining activities to decrease discretionary marketing  distribution and promotional expenses  consolidation of numerous functions across the organization to create a team  which was more productive and able to respond faster to global customer needs  and closure of a facility in germany and moving our operations to other locations within data i o 
at december  all restructuring expenses associated with the activities detailed for and had been paid and the excess expense accrual of  was reversed during critical accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  data i o evaluates our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
data i o believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition sales of our semiconductor programming equipment products requiring installation by us that is other than perfunctory are recorded when installation is complete  or at the later of customer acceptance or installation  if an acceptance clause is specified in the sales terms 
installation that is considered perfunctory includes any installation that can be performed by other parties  such as distributors  other vendors  or in most cases customers themselves 
this takes into account the complexity  skill  and training needed as well as customer expectations regarding installation 
the revenue related to these products is recognized at the time of shipment 
we record revenue from the sale of service and update contracts as deferred revenue and we recognize it on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
we establish a reserve for sales returns based on historical trends in product returns and estimates for new items 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we base the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be adversely affected 
inventory provision we base inventory purchases and commitments upon future demand forecasts and historic usage 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  data i o may be required to increase our inventory provision adjustments and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals data i o accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
tax valuation allowances given the uncertainty created by our loss history  data i o expects to continue to limit the recognition of net deferred tax assets and maintain the tax valuation allowances 
we expect  therefore  that reversals of the tax valuation allowance will take place for the next few years only as we are able to take advantage of the underlying tax loss or other attributes in carry forward 
the transfer pricing and expense or cost sharing arrangements are complex areas where judgments  such as the determination of arms length arrangements  can be subject to challenges by different tax jurisdictions 
results of continuing operations net sales in thousands net sales by product line change change automated programming systems    non automated programming systems    totals    net sales by location united states    of total international    of total vs 
revenues increased in over this increase results from our automated systems sales including growth in the proline roadrunner  the ps family including the ps new in and the related automated systems aftermarket 
data i o s non automated systems continued a trend of declining sales in older products  however flashpak  our newer flashcore based programmer  continued to show good growth with sales more than doubling in international sales grew  particularly in asia  while sales in the us market continued to decline 
the us dollar continued to weaken in  which we believe assisted our export sales  due to increased buying power of foreign currencies and the favorable effect of currency translation for sales denominated in foreign currency  and in particular the euro  which accounted for  of the sales growth 
we see a continuing trend in migration of customers moving manufacturing operations to low cost geographies  thereby increasing international sales opportunities 
the weakened us dollar  especially compared to the euro  is expected to continue to assist our export sales 
in  we introduced the ps and ps flashcore automated programming systems  imagewriter  our isp solution  edss tool suite for devices support  and a version of our proline roadrunner designed for panasonic cm machines 
we expect these products to increase our revenues  however  partially offsetting this expected increase is the continued trend of declining sales of our older non automated product lines 
vs 
data i o experienced a turnaround in sales during  with a resurgence in sales of automated system products 
in particular  automated systems aftermarket products and ps flashcore and related upgrades  which were new in  drove the sales growth 
our non automated systems continued a trend of declining sales in older products  however  flashpak  which was new in  grew in  partially offsetting the decline 
also contributing to the non automated system decline was the loss of a low cost programmer line 
ice technology  our former supplier of the line  ceased business 
in  sales related to the ice technology products were approximately  compared to  in international sales grew  particularly in europe  while sales in the us market continued to decline 
the us dollar continued to weaken in  which we believe assisted our export sales  due to increased buying power of foreign currencies and the favorable effect of currency translation for sales denominated in foreign currency  and in particular the euro  which accounted for million of the sales growth 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
gross margins increased in dollars but declined as a percentage of sales for compared to the increase in gross margin dollars was due primarily to the increase in revenue dollars 
the decline in the gross margin as a percentage of sales reflects product mix shifts to those with higher material costs  as well as unfavorable average selling price variance of  and unfavorable manufacturing overhead variance of  the manufacturing overhead application variance resulted largely from decreasing our inventory level 
vs 
gross margins increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales for compared to the increase in gross margin dollars was due to both the increase in revenue dollars as well as the savings related to our restructuring actions 
the restructuring efforts lowered our annual breakeven point for net income by implementing cost reductions 
also benefiting margins was the absence of inventory reserve charges amounting to  in the continued product mix shift towards higher margin automated systems aftermarket continued to be a favorable factor in research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development r d spending for as compared to increased  however  as a percentage of sales  r d remained about 
the increase in spending relates primarily to new product initiatives 
in particular  the imagewriter  our new in system programming solution  and edss  a tool suite for device support  were launched in november of data i o s r d focused on the flashcore architecture  expanding its capability to address newer technologies like nand flash support for m systems diskonchip technology as well as microcontroller device support 
new products in the ps family of automated systems included the ps flashcore  and  introduced in early  the ps flashcore 
also  we released a proline roadrunner version for panasonic cm machines 
finally  we completed our initiative to create global device support factories with the creation of our engineering operation in shanghai  china  which joins our other locations in redmond  washington  germany  and india 
vs 
research and development r d spending for as compared to declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
this was again due to the restructuring actions  primarily personnel reductions and cost control efforts taken during and during  data i o s r d focused on the flashcore architecture  expanding its capability to address newer technologies like nand flash support for m systems diskonchip technology as well as microcontroller device support 
new products in the ps family of automated systems included the ps flashcore  the tf tray feeder system and  introduced in early  the ps flashcore 
also  we released a proline roadrunner version for panasonic machines 
we believe it is essential to invest in r d to significantly enhance our existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
we are focusing our r d efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore and programmer architecture  new automated handling solutions  and enhancing our new imagewriter 
selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  in versus the prior year due primarily to our strategic investments in china totaling  and the hiring of additional key personnel of  as well as the unfavorable currency translation impact of  from european based operating costs 
in addition  we incurred higher commission costs of  based on the higher sales volume and a higher mix of representative sales than distributor sales and higher travel and entertainment costs of  partially offsetting this was a reduction in bonus incentive compensation of  related to the net loss 
vs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by  in versus the prior year due primarily to the restructuring actions and reduced marketing expenses 
partially offsetting this decrease was our increased facility costs due to increased rent and loss of a sub tenant  profit based bonuses of  and increased selling costs due to currency translation of  with the weaker us dollar and commissions 
interest in thousands change change interest income interest expense vs 
interest income for decreased as compared to primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities 
vs 
interest income for increased as compared to primarily due to the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
income taxes in thousands income tax expense benefit vs 
and vs 
income tax expense or benefit in all years relates to foreign income taxes 
for financial reporting purposes  data i o established tax valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty relating to the realization of such asset values 
we had valuation allowances of million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
given the uncertainty created by our loss history  we expect to continue to limit the recognition of net deferred tax assets and maintain the tax valuation allowances 
inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
the transaction losses resulted primarily from sales by our german subsidiary to our main customers  which were invoiced in us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to our foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital     at december   data i o s principal sources of liquidity consisted of existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our working capital decreased by  and our current ratio decreased from in to in our cash and cash equivalents increased by million during primarily due to the increase of cash generated from operating activities of million 
the million of cash generated from operations primarily included a  decrease in accounts receivable  a  decrease in inventory   of demonstration equipment transferred to cost of goods sold   of depreciation and amortization offset by a  decrease in accrued expenses 
the decrease in accounts receivable primarily results from increased collection efforts during with a decrease in days sales outstanding from days in to days in data i o has implemented lean processes and is outsourcing some manufacturing processes resulting in further reduced inventory levels 
the decrease in accrued expenses reflected the lower fourth quarter sales and a loss for the period causing decreased incentive pay and lower tax related payable amounts 
we used million of cash in investing activities during compared to million during the decrease was driven by the level of investment in marketable securities and the level of cash available from net income 
as data i o reported a net loss of  in compared to net income of million in  less cash was available for investment 
the net marketable security balance decreased in total by million 
investment activity also included million in purchases of property  plant and equipment in compared to  in the purchases were primarily related to demonstration equipment  information technology equipment and computers  and our new subsidiary located in shanghai 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements 
we estimate that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during are planned to be approximately million 
although we expect to make such expenditures  we had no significant outstanding purchase commitments at december  we are investigating the acquisition of a new information system during which is excluded from the capital spending estimate 
these expenditures are expected to be funded by existing and internally generated funds or lease financing 
as a result of our significant product development  customer support  international expansion and selling and marketing efforts  data i o has required substantial working capital to fund our operations 
over the last few years  we restructured our operations to lower our costs and operating expenditures in geographic regions and to lower the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point  to preserve our cash position and to focus on profitable operations 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least december  any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and or seek additional financing 
aggregate contractual obligations and commitments data i o has purchase obligations for inventory and production costs as well as other obligations such as capital expenditures  service contracts  marketing  and development agreements 
arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty  and with short notice  typically less than days 
any amounts reflected on the balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table below 
data i o has no long term debt 
data i o has commitments under non cancelable operating leases and other agreements  primarily for factory and office space  with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as follows for the years ending december  in thousands purchase operating obligations leases and thereafter total   share repurchase program under a previously announced share repurchase program  data i o is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
we may execute these purchases through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions  and we may commence or discontinue at any time 
as of december   data i o has repurchased  shares under this repurchase program at a total cost of approximately million 
data i o has not repurchased shares under this plan since the second quarter of  although it still has the authority to do so 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provision of sfas no 
will apply to inventory costs beginning in fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of data i o 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of data i o 
see note for the pro forma impact on net earnings loss and earnings loss per share from calculating stock related compensation costs under the fair value alternative of sfas no 
however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas no 
r may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas no 
 but such differences have not yet been quantified 
also  past usage of option plans and stock purchase plans may not reflect our practices in future periods 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction provided to us based manufacturers by the american jobs creation act of  and fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp clarifies that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the american jobs creation act of the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fsp fas provides enterprises more time beyond the financial reporting period during which the act took effect to evaluate the act s impact on the enterprise s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
the fsps went into effect upon being issued and did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of data i o 
in march  the securities exchange commission announced that the compliance date for non accelerated filers and foreign private issuers pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act has been extended 
under the latest extension  a company that is not required to file its annual and quarterly reports on an accelerated basis and a foreign private issuer filing its annual report on form f or f  must begin to comply with the requirements for the assessment and the reporting on internal control over financial reporting for its first fiscal year ending on or after july  this is a one year extension from the previously established july  compliance date 
data i o expects that it will continue to be a delayed filer and that it will  therefore  be required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk with respect to our foreign currency exchange rate risk  we currently use only foreign currency hedge derivative instruments  which  at a given date  are not material 
however  data i o is exposed to interest rate risks 
we generally invest in high grade commercial paper with original maturity dates of twelve months or less and conservative money market funds to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk on our marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  and december  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of these financial instruments is not material
