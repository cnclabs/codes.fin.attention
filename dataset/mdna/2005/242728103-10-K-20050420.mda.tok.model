item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
as used in this report  the terms fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  refer to the company s fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
the term fiscal refers to the company s fiscal year that will end on january  restatement of financial statements as a result of the publicity on the restaurant industry financial statement restatements related to leases  the company commenced a review of certain of its accounting policies related to leases during january subsequently  on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
based on the company s internal review  and after consultation with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and predecessor independent registered public accounting firm on april   the company restated its financial statements for years prior to fiscal to correct its accounting for landlord allowances  calculation of straight line rent expense  recognition of rent holiday periods  and depreciation of leasehold improvements for its retail stores 
certain of the company s store leases contain provisions that enable the company or the landlord to terminate the lease if sales during a defined measurement period fall below agreed upon levels 
the company has historically recorded rent expense on a straight line basis  beginning with the lease commencement date  which generally coincides with the store opening date  through the early termination date 
the period during which a store was prepared for opening historically was excluded from the straight line rent schedule 
financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  states  however  that rent holidays should be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term  which according to fasb technical bulletin  issues relating to accounting for leases ftb  commences on the date the company is given the right to control the use of the leased property 
consistent with this guidance  the company has changed the period used for determining the deferred rent calculation to commence on the date the company began controlling the use of the property ie began preparing a store for opening through the initial non cancelable life of the lease 
depreciation of leasehold improvements has historically been calculated based upon the term of the lease 
the company has changed its accounting for leasehold improvements to depreciate leasehold improvements over the lesser of the term of the lease or years 
in addition  the company has historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of the cost of leasehold improvements  resulting in lower depreciation expense  and reflected the cash received within investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a reduction of purchases of property  plant  and equipment 
this treatment was consistent whether the improvement allowance was provided in cash or in the form of a rent abatement 
ftb requires that lease incentives such as tenant allowances be recorded as a deferred liability  amortized over the term of the lease and reflected as a reduction to rent expense 
previously  amortization commenced on the date the store was opened and was reflected as a reduction to depreciation and amortization 
consistent with the recording of rent expense described above  the company now amortizes tenant allowances commencing on the date the company has the right to control the use of the leased property 
tenant allowances in the form of rent abatements were historically charged to rent expense on a straight line basis over the number of months the rent was abated 
tenant allowances are now included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the effects of the adjustments relating to the above items include a reduction to retained earnings of  net of tax  as of february  and decreases to net income of  or per diluted share  and  or per diluted share for fiscal and  respectively 
see note b to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a summary of the effects of these changes on the consolidated balance sheet as of january   as well as on the consolidated statements of operations  changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for fiscal and fiscal the discussion contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to these corrections
