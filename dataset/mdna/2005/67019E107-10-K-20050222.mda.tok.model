table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview nstar or the company is a holding company engaged through its subsidiaries in the energy delivery business serving approximately million customers in massachusetts  including approximately million electric distribution customers in communities and approximately  natural gas distribution customers in communities 
nstar was created in in connection with the merger of bec energy and commonwealth energy system 
nstar s retail utility subsidiaries are boston edison company boston edison  commonwealth electric company comelectric  cambridge electric light company cambridge electric and nstar gas company nstar gas 
its wholesale electric subsidiary is canal electric company canal 
nstar s three retail electric companies collectively operate as nstar electric 
reference in this report to nstar shall mean the registrant nstar or nstar and its subsidiaries as the context requires 
reference in this report to nstar electric shall mean boston edison  comelectric and cambridge electric together 
nstar s non utility  unregulated operations include district energy operations advanced energy systems  inc and nstar steam corporation  telecommunications operations nstar communications  inc nstar com and a liquefied natural gas service company hopkinton lng corp utility operations accounted for approximately of consolidated operating revenues in  and nstar generates its revenues primarily from the sale of energy  distribution and transmission services to customers and from its unregulated businesses 
nstar s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in unit sales of kwh and mmbtu  which directly determine the level of distribution and transmission revenues recognized 
in accordance with the regulatory rate structure in which nstar operates  its recovery of energy costs are fully reconciled with the level of energy revenues currently recorded and  therefore  do not have an impact on earnings 
as a result of this rate structure  any variability in the cost of energy supply purchased will impact purchased power and cost of gas sold expense and corresponding revenues but will not affect the company s earnings

other factors in addition to those listed here could also adversely affect nstar 
this report also describes material contingencies and critical accounting policies and estimates in this section and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and nstar encourages a review of these notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates nstar s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that require significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
nstar believes that its accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the reported results of operations  cash flows and financial position are described below 
a 
revenue recognition utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the mdte and ferc 
revenues related to the sale  transmission and distribution of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters that are read on a systematic basis throughout the month 
meters that are not read during a given month are estimated and trued up in a future period 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last billing date are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled electric revenue is estimated each month based on daily generation volumes territory 
table of contents load  estimated line losses and applicable customer rates 
unbilled natural gas revenues are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated gas losses and tariffed rates in effect 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
nstar s non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
the level of unbilled revenues is subject to seasonal weather conditions 
electric sales volumes are typically higher in the winter and summer than in the spring or fall 
gas sales volumes are impacted by colder weather since a substantial portion of nstar s customer base uses natural gas for heating purposes 
as a result  nstar records a higher level of unbilled revenue during the seasonal periods mentioned above 
b 
regulatory accounting nstar follows accounting policies prescribed by gaap  the ferc and the mdte 
as a rate regulated company  nstar s utility subsidiaries are subject to the financial accounting standards board  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
the application of sfas results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries 
nstar s energy delivery businesses remain subject to rate regulation and continue to meet the criteria for application of sfas this ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets based on the probability of current and future cash inflows 
regulatory assets represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded regulatory assets of billion and billion  respectively 
nstar continuously reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
nstar expects to fully recover these regulatory assets in its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  nstar would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
c 
derivative instruments power contracts the electric distribution industry may contract to buy and sell electricity under option contracts  which allow the distribution company the flexibility to determine when and in what quantity to take electricity in order to align with its demand for electricity 
these contracts would normally meet the definition of a derivative instrument requiring mark to market accounting 
however  because electricity cannot be stored and utilities are obligated to maintain sufficient capacity to meet the electricity needs of its customer base  an option contract for the purchase of electricity typically qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception as described in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and derivative implementation group dig interpretations and  therefore  does not require mark to market accounting 
nstar electric has long term purchase power agreements that are used primarily to meet its standard offer obligation 
the majority of these agreements are not reflected as an asset or liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
however  based on dig interpretations  nstar  as of december   recorded four contracts at fair value on its accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
at december   nstar recorded six purchase power contracts at fair value 
in anticipation of the end of standard offer service in february  two of the six contracts were divested in through regulatory approved agreements 
refer to the consolidated financial statements  note o  for more detail on the buy out of certain purchase power contracts 
as a result  the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the above market portion of the four contracts at december  and for the fair value of the above market portion of the six contracts at december  is approximately million and million  respectively  and are reflected as a component of deferred credits power contracts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents during the first quarter of  nstar expects to close on a securitization financing that will affect these four contracts that are classified as derivative instruments 
nstar electric has entered into buy out agreements for all four contracts and expects to finance the buy out payments through a securitization financing 
when this occurs  the fair value of these four contracts will be removed as a derivative instrument from the balance sheet and the securitization debt obligation will be recorded along with an offsetting regulatory asset 
at december   the four contracts were valued using a discounted cash flow model and a discount rate 
the market value assumption used was provided by a third party who determines such pricing for the new england power market 
had management used an alternative assumption  the values of the contracts at december  and would have changed significantly 
a one percent increase or decrease to the discount rate would change the above market value for the four contracts by approximately million from what is presently recorded at december  nstar electric recovers all of its electricity supply costs  including the above market costs from customers 
for the four purchase power agreements at december   the recovery of its above market costs occurs through for boston edison and through for comelectric 
these recovery periods coincide with the contractual terms of these purchase power agreements 
therefore  in addition to the liability recorded  nstar also recorded a corresponding regulatory asset representing the future recovery of these actual costs 
as a result  any changes to the fair value of these contracts will not have an effect on nstar s earnings 
d 
pension and other postretirement benefits nstar s annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  expected and actual earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors are not immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
there were no significant changes to nstar s pension benefits in  and that had a significant impact on recorded pension costs 
as further described in note h to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  nstar revised the discount rate at december  to from at december  to reflect market conditions and the characteristics of nstar s pension obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on its pension plan assets for remained at net of plan expenses  the same as these assumptions will have a significant impact on reported pension costs in future years in accordance with the cost recognition approach of sfas described above 
this impact  however  will be mitigated through nstar s regulatory accounting treatment of qualified pension and pbop costs 
see further discussion of regulatory accounting treatment below 
in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  these assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
nstar s pension plan the plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  were affected by significant declines in the financial markets from through and improvements in the financial markets for both and fluctuations in market returns impacted the funded status of the plan at both december  and  and will affect pension costs in future periods 
the following chart reflects the projected benefit obligation and cost sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 

table of contents in thousands actuarial assumption change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation impact on cost increase decrease pension increase in discount rate basis points   decrease in discount rate basis points   increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate basis points   decrease in discount rate basis points   increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  n a not applicable the plans discount rates are based on rates of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s plans and through periodic bond portfolio matching 
both of these factors contribute to management s decision for selecting the discount rate 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  nstar considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the target allocation for the investments over a year time period 
in  nstar kept the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at as a result of the prevailing outlook for equity market returns 
this rate is presented net of both administrative expenses and investment expenses  which have averaged approximately for both and at december   the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded plan assets 
the abo represents the present value of benefits earned without considering future salary increases 
since the fair value of its plan assets was less than the abo  nstar was required to record this difference as an additional minimum pension liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  in  due to positive plan investment performance and company contributions over the last two years of million  the fair value of the plan s assets exceeded the plan s abo at december  as a result  the minimum liability has been reversed and the prepaid pension amount has been restored to the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  on october   the mdte approved nstar s request for a reconciliation rate adjustment mechanism related to pension and pbop costs 
as part of this ruling  nstar is allowed to record a regulatory asset in lieu of taking a charge to other comprehensive income for the required additional minimum liability adjustment 
as of december   nstar recorded a regulatory asset of million 
at december   the regulatory asset was reversed and the prepaid pension asset of million was reinstated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of while not required to make contributions to the plan  nstar anticipates that it will contribute approximately million to the plan in nstar believes it has adequate access to capital resources to support these contributions 

table of contents e 
decommissioning cost estimates the accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will not affect nstar s results of operations or cash flows because these costs will be collected from customers through nstar s transition charge filings with the mdte 
while nstar no longer directly owns any operating nuclear power plants  nstar electric collectively owns  through its equity investments  of connecticut yankee atomic power company  of yankee atomic electric company  and of maine yankee atomic power company  collectively  the yankee companies 
periodically  nstar obtains estimates from the management of the yankee companies on the cost of decommissioning the connecticut yankee nuclear unit cy  the yankee atomic nuclear unit ya  and the maine yankee nuclear unit my 
these nuclear units are completely shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities 
based on estimates from the yankee companies management as of december   the total remaining cost for decommissioning each nuclear unit is approximately as follows million for cy  million for ya and million for my 
of these amounts  nstar electric is obligated to pay million towards the decommissioning of cy  million toward ya  and million toward my 
these amounts are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as power contract liabilities with a corresponding regulatory asset and do not impact the current results of operations and cash flow 
these estimates may be revised from time to time based on information available to the yankee companies regarding future costs 
the yankee companies have received approval from ferc for recovery of these costs and nstar expects any additional increases to these costs to be included in future rate applications with the ferc  with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors  including nstar electric 
nstar electric would recover its share of any allowed increases from customers through the transition charge 
cy s estimated decommissioning costs increased significantly in and the increase reflects the fact that cy is now self performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with bechtel power corporation bechtel 
in july  cy filed with ferc for recovery of these increased costs 
in august  ferc issued an order accepting the new rates  beginning in february  subject to refund 
cy is currently in litigation with bechtel over the termination of its decommissioning contract 
additionally  bechtel filed a complaint against cy asserting several claims as well as wrongful termination 
bechtel sought to garnish the decommissioning trust and related payments 
in october  bechtel and cy entered into a stipulation under which bechtel relinquished its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of cy s real property in connecticut with a book value of million and the escrowing of portions of the sponsors periodic payments  up to a total of million  all of which the sponsors  which include nstar electric  are scheduled to pay to cy through june  this stipulation is subject to approval of the court and would not be implemented until the court found that such assets were subject to attachment 
cy intends to contest the ability of bechtel to attach these assets 
discovery is underway and a trial has been scheduled for may nstar cannot predict the timing or outcome of the litigation with bechtel but does not expect a material impact on nstar s financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
asset retirement obligations on january   nstar adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal 
table of contents operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations under lease arrangements 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
nstar has identified certain immaterial long lived assets  including obligations under lease and easement arrangements  and has determined that it is legally responsible to remove such property 
for its regulated utility businesses  nstar has identified legal retirement obligations that are currently not material to its financial statements 
the recognition of a potential asset retirement obligation will have no impact on its earnings 
in accordance with sfas  for nstar s rate regulated utilities  nstar would establish regulatory assets or liabilities to defer any differences between the liabilities established for ratemaking purposes and those recorded as required under sfas for nstar s regulated utility businesses  the ultimate cost to remove utility plant from service cost of removal is recognized as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment 
as of december  and  the estimated amount of the cost of removal included in regulatory liabilities was approximately million and million  respectively  based on the estimated cost of removal component in current depreciation rates 
nstar has also identified several long lived assets  in which it has legal obligations to remove such property  for its non regulated businesses 
as a result  in  nstar recorded an increase in non utility property of approximately million  an asset retirement liability of approximately million and a cumulative effect of adoption after tax  reducing net income by million in the cumulative effect adjustment was recorded as part of depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation clarifies when an entity would be required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future would be factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the recognition of the liability 
the interpretation would be effective for nstar no later than the end of fiscal year nstar is currently assessing the impact that the interpretation will have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
variable interest entities in  the fasb issued an exposure draft  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised in december fin r  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vie by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
this interpretation had two effective dates december  and march  nstar has a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary  bec funding llc  established to undertake the sale of million in notes to a special purpose trust created by two massachusetts state agencies 
nstar consolidates this entity 
as part of nstar s assessment of fin r and  for compliance at december   nstar reviewed the substance of this entity to determine if it is still proper to consolidate this entity 
based on its review  nstar has concluded that bec funding llc is a vie and should continue to be consolidated by nstar 

table of contents for the march  effective date of fin r  nstar evaluated other entities with which it conducts significant transactions  including companies that supply power to nstar through its purchase power agreements 
nstar determined that it is possible that five of these companies may be considered vies 
these companies have power plants that have daily capacity output ranging from megawatts mw to mw 
through december  and  nstar purchased a total of approximately  megawatt hours mwh and  mwh  respectively  under these agreements 
these purchases approximate of the total mwh purchased by nstar for years ended december  and and amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to determine if these counterparties are vies and if nstar is the primary beneficiary of these counterparties  nstar concluded that it needed more information from the entities 
nstar attempted to obtain the information required and requested  in writing  these entities provide the company with the necessary information 
however  each of the entities has indicated that they will not provide the requested information as they are not contractually obligated to provide such confidential information 
since nstar was unable to obtain the necessary information and  as allowed under a scope exception in fin r  the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the consolidation of any entities with which nstar has a purchase power agreement 
additionally  during  nstar executed purchase power buy out restructuring agreements with a majority of the entities from which nstar attempted to obtain additional information in order to determine if these entities are vies 
these buy out restructuring agreements received regulatory approval in january refer to consolidated financial statements  note o  for more detail on the purchase power buy out agreements 
as a result  nstar will no longer pursue obtaining the necessary information to determine whether it has a potential variable interest in these entities 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this standard also eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the standard is effective for periods beginning after june  nstar is currently assessing its valuation options allowed in this standard but  preliminarily  expects this standard to impact annual earnings by approximately million pre tax  or per share

table of contents on march   nstar electric and nstar gas filed their service quality reports with the mdte that demonstrated the companies achieved levels of reliability and performance  the reports indicate that no penalty was assessable for the mdte concurred with nstar s determination in an order issued in october nstar monitors its service quality continuously to determine its contingent liability  and if it s probable that a liability has been incurred and is estimable  a liability would be accrued 
annually  each nstar utility subsidiary makes a service quality performance filing with the mdte 
any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period that the mdte issues an order determining the amount of any such liability 
recently  the mdte voted to initiate an investigation into potentially modifying the service quality indicators for all massachusetts utilities 
until any such order is issued  the current service quality indicators will remain in place 
nstar currently cannot predict the outcome of this investigation or its impact 
as of december   nstar electric s and nstar gas performance has exceeded the applicable established benchmarks and  as such  that no liability has been accrued for b 
retail electric rates electric distribution companies in massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through either standard offer or default service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier 
standard offer service will end on february  therefore  effective march   all customers who have not chosen to receive service from a competitive supplier will be provided default service 
default service rates are reset every six months every three months for large commercial and industrial customers 
the price of default service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for power 
as of december   and  customers of nstar electric had approximately  and  respectively  of their load requirements provided by competitive suppliers 
on december   the ferc issued an order approving boston edison s october request to modify its open access transmission tariff oatt 
effective january   boston edison is allowed to include percent of construction work in progress in its rate base for transmission projects by including this amount in its local network service transmission rate formula  rather than capitalizing allowance for funds used during construction afudc charges on the entire construction expense balance 
the order is subject to boston edison filing annual reports of its long term transmission plan 
in december  nstar electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for  including a preliminary reconciliation of transition  transmission  standard offer and default service costs and revenues through the mdte subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective january  the filings are to be updated in february to reflect final costs and revenues which are subject to final reconciliation 
on february   the independent system operator new england began operating as a regional transmission organization 
as a result  nstar has given notice to the rto and other interested parties of its intent to file for proposed changes to its oatt 
this change is expected to provide for consistent application of the oatt among all nstar electric companies 
the oatt and the related revenue have been based on this proposed change 
if successful  nstar electric expects to include the impact in its billing rates 
effective january   nstar electric s standard offer service fuel adjustment sosfa rates for each of boston edison  comelectric and cambridge were modified to a level of cents per kilowatt hour with the approval of the mdte 
effective october   boston edison s sosfa rate was modified to cents per kilowatt hour from zero upon approval by the mdte 
the mdte has allowed companies to adjust prices to reduce deferred cost balances that arise due to rapidly changing market costs for the oil and natural gas used to generate electricity and the sosfa is designed to collect the costs of fuel that companies incur for purchasing electricity from their suppliers to serve their standard offer service customers 
effective september   the boston edison sosfa 
table of contents was reduced to zero while the comelectric and cambridge electric sosfas were increased to cents per kilowatt hour until january  when they were reduced to cents per kilowatt hour 
these changes followed an increase in this rate adjustment from zero to cents per kilowatt hour that was effective may  for all three nstar electric companies 
the sosfa was at zero from april  through april  for all three nstar electric companies 
the mdte has ruled that these fuel index adjustments are excluded from the rate reduction requirement under the massachusetts electric restructuring act 
in december  nstar electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for  including a preliminary reconciliation of transition  transmission  standard offer and default service costs and revenues through the mdte subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective january  the filings were updated in february to include final costs and revenues for on december   nstar electric and nstar gas filed their annual reconciliation report on their pension and pbop rate adjustment mechanism 
hearings were held during nstar anticipates an order by the end of the first quarter of nstar cannot predict the overall timing and result of this order on its financial position or results of operations

wholesale market rule changes standard market design smd pursuant to orders issued by the ferc  wholesale electric markets in new england have been operating under smd since march  under smd  generators are dispatched on a least cost basis until the generation dispatched equals the amount of energy required 
the clearing price is set at the price of the next available megawatt of generation and is paid to all dispatched generators 
smd provides an additional market in which wholesale power costs can be hedged a day in advance through binding financial commitments 
also  under smd  wholesale power clearing prices vary by location  called load zones  with prices in load zones with less efficient generation being higher than in load zones with more efficient generation during periods when transmission constraints prevent the lower cost generation from moving from one load zone to another 
this mechanism is known as locational marginal pricing lmp 
nstar electric s service territory covers two of the eight load zones in new england northeastern ma nema and southeastern ma sema 
nema is import constrained and sema is export constrained 
the majority of nstar s customers are in the nema load zone 
during periods of transmission constraints  nema has a higher lmp than sema 
as part of smd  load serving entities  like nstar electric  were granted proceeds from the auction of financial transmission rights that is conducted by iso ne 
nstar electric uses proceeds to mitigate costs to customers 
locational installed capacity licap the iso ne has proposed a new market rule designed to compensate wholesale generators for their capacity  called licap 
the proposed licap rules require electric load serving entities lse  like nstar electric  to procure capacity within the zones where load is served 
the current market structure allows capacity  located anywhere in new england  to count towards a lse s obligation  regardless of load zone 
at this point  it appears likely that nstar s new kv transmission project will reduce transmission constraints causing capacity prices between nema and sema to converge  which could ultimately render this locational aspect of licap a non factor for nstar customers 
however  since proposed market rules require that a certain amount of capacity be procured in the nema zone and  depending on how many market rules are finally adopted  these requirements could impact pricing for capacity in the nema zone 
additionally  much of the capacity in the nema zone has issued notice of its intent to file with the ferc for cost of service type agreements called reliability must run agreements for the recovery of their costs prior to the implementation of licap 
the proposed licap rules will impact overall capacity pricing levels in new england 
since the new england market as a whole is currently in a surplus position  capacity trades at a relatively low price 
one of the goals of licap is to provide a higher level of compensation to generators than what is currently being earned in this surplus market 
this will likely increase the price of power to nstar s customers 
the proposed licap market 
table of contents rules are contentious and are currently being litigated at ferc and in the courts 
a final ferc ruling on the issue is expected in and the current schedule calls for an implementation date of january  until these rules are finalized and approved  nstar cannot predict the actual impact these changes will have on nstar electric and its customers 
regional transmission organization rto on march   the ferc decided to schedule hearings for a joint return on equity roe filing made by participating new england transmission owners  including nstar electric 
the filing requested an increase in the base roe component of the regional and local transmission rates  to be provided under the regional transmission organization for new england rto ne open access transmission tariff oatt  to a single roe of for all regional and local transmission rates 
presently  transmission service in new england is provided under a two tier structure  with the potential for the roe for local service to be different than for regional service for the same transmission provider 
ferc has previously approved other rto filings for an roe adder of basis points in regional rates as an incentive for joining an rto for regional service 
in addition  ferc also scheduled hearings to address the proposal for an additional basis points in regional rates to provide an incentive to build new transmission facilities 
the transmission owners maintain that sufficient equity returns are needed to elicit the necessary investments in transmission within an rto 
settlement negotiations occurred in april before a ferc administrative law judge and were unsuccessful 
hearings on the base roe and basis point adder began in january the joint roe filing among the transmission owners was made in connection with the proposed formation of rto ne by the transmission owners and iso ne  the present administrator of the new england power pool nepool oatt  and is an important and integral component of the agreement to form an rto for the new england region 
on november   the ferc accepted a settlement agreement among nepool  iso ne and the new england transmission owners  including nstar electric  which resolved many issues left outstanding from ferc s march order conditionally approving the formation of rto ne 
the november rd order also provided clarification of certain aspects of the march order regarding the transmission owners request for an increase in the base return on equity component of the regional and local transmission rates 
this clarification narrowed the scope of issues to be addressed during the january hearings on the base roe proposal and the transmission owner s proposal for an additional basis points in regional rates to provide an incentive to build new transmission facilities 
finally  the november rd order required the satisfaction of several ministerial conditions before iso ne could begin to operate as an rto 
iso ne and the transmission owners have since satisfied such conditions and provided days notice to ferc and nepool that on february   iso ne would begin to operate as an rto 
effective february   the iso ne is an independent entity  without a financial interest in the region s marketplace  having operating authority over the new england transmission grid and the responsibility to make impartial decisions on the development and implementation of market rules 
the iso ne operates under a series of contractual arrangements that define its functions and responsibilities  including a transmission operating agreement  which governs the relationship between the owners of transmission facilities  such as nstar electric  and the iso ne  as the operator of the new england transmission grid 
separate agreements govern the operation of the spot power and related markets  the iso ne s interactions with market participants and merchant transmission facilities 
nstar s management cannot estimate the impact of the rto on the company

natural gas rates nstar gas generates revenues primarily through the sale and or transportation of natural gas 
gas sales and transportation services are divided into two categories firm  whereby nstar gas must supply gas and or transportation services to customers on demand  and interruptible  whereby nstar gas may  generally during colder months  temporarily discontinue service to high volume commercial and industrial customers 
sales and transportation of gas to interruptible customers do not materially affect nstar gas operating income because substantially the entire margin on such service is returned to its firm customers as rate reductions 

table of contents in addition to delivery service rates  nstar gas tariffs include a seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause cgac and a local distribution adjustment clause ldac 
the cgac provides for the recovery of all gas supply costs from firm sales customers or default service customers 
the ldac provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers 
the cgac is filed semi annually for approval by the mdte 
the ldac is filed annually for approval 
in addition  nstar gas is required to file interim changes to its cgac factor when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 
due to the increase in wholesale natural gas prices  nstar gas was allowed by the mdte to increase its winter seasonal cgac factor effective november  by over the prior winter season s factor 
the cgac factor was allowed to increase two additional times during that winter season due to the increases in the wholesale cost of gas 
on november   the winter season cgac factor was set at a level higher than the average for the prior winter season due to higher wholesale gas costs 
on january   the cgac factor was allowed to increase by to reflect an additional increase in the cost of gas 
in the last three years  the winter season cgac factor was revised upward to reflect increases in the cost of gas caused by varying market conditions 
to date  the cgac factor for the winter of has ranged from per therm to  in the winter of  the cgac ranged from per therm to per therm  the range for the winter of was per them to per therm 
other legal matters in the normal course of its business  nstar and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters  including civil litigation 
management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible court ordered damages  settlement amounts  and related litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts covered by insurance 
based on the information currently available  nstar does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in circumstances could have a material impact on its results of operations for a reporting period 
rcn abandonment on december   nstar exited its investment in rcn and formally abandoned its million shares of rcn common stock 
as a result  nstar recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million  or per share 
nstar determined that the abandonment at that time was the most tax efficient  cost effective and expedient means to exit its rcn investment 
nstar determined other alternatives such as a sale of the shares would be less beneficial as a result of the number of shares held by nstar  the trading value in shares of rcn common stock  the potential negative impact that a large volume of sales of rcn common stock could have on the value of such shares  the length of time required to exit such investment through a sale of such shares and the fact that no block purchasers expressed an interest in purchasing such shares 
nstar determined that the benefit of a tax realization event at that time and in that manner outweighed any benefit that it would likely realize from any other alternative  including the future sale of such shares in an orderly fashion consistent with all laws  rules and regulations 
as a result of this abandonment  the investment was written down to zero as of december  the cumulative increase in fair value of these shares since december   including the impact of the abandonment charge for these shares  is included in other comprehensive income  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
income tax matters a 
rcn abandonment tax treatment as a result of the rcn share abandonment  the company claimed an ordinary loss on its tax return for this item 
the ordinary loss tax treatment resulted in the company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write down of this asset for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents the requirement for a tax valuation allowance  therefore  is no longer applicable 
accordingly  the company reversed this reserve as of december the company believes it is more likely than not that it is entitled to this ordinary loss deduction 
the company expects the internal revenue service irs to review this transaction and it is possible that the irs will disagree 
in accordance with the company s tax policy as it relates to uncertain tax positions  the company has established a loss contingency of approximately million at december  this amount represents the tax impact to the company should the ordinary loss ultimately be recharacterized to a capital loss 
this contingent liability is recorded as part of deferred credits other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if the company s position is not upheld  the company may be required to make future cash expenditures to the irs that may impact nstar s cash requirements in future periods 
b 
tax valuation allowance sfas  accounting for income taxes  prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
nstar had determined that it was more likely than not that a current or future income tax benefit would not be realized relating to the write downs of its rcn investment that were recorded in the second and fourth quarters of and previously in the first quarter of these write downs resulted from the significant declines in the market value of the telecommunications sector  including rcn 
as a result of this uncertainty  nstar recorded a million tax valuation allowance on the entire tax benefit associated with these write downs during and during and  as a result of previously unanticipated capital gain transactions  nstar recognized million and million  respectively  of this tax benefit 
additionally  based on the irs review of nstar s and federal income tax returns  nstar recognized the tax benefits relating to the incremental operating losses from the joint venture that were allocated to nstar 
these tax returns are currently at the office of irs appeals on other matters 
the tax valuation allowance included reserves related to the tax treatment of these losses through june   the final date of jv loss allocation to nstar 
each of the tax returns filed for through claimed operating losses 
the tax return filed for claimed the remaining portion of these operating losses 
based on the irs examining agent s review  no adjustment for the years under audit was proposed 
this determination was arrived at in the fourth quarter of and  as a result  nstar applied the treatment of these operating losses for all years on a consistent basis  allowing a reduction to its valuation allowance of approximately million as a reduction to income tax expense included as a component of the write down to the rcn investment 
on december   nstar exited from its investment in rcn and formally abandoned the million shares of rcn common stock 
as mentioned above  a tax valuation allowance had been established in a previous year to offset the potential future tax benefits resulting from write downs of nstar s investment in rcn 
as a result of the abandonment  the company claimed an ordinary loss on its tax return 
this treatment results in the company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write downs of this investment for financial reporting purposes 
the requirement for a tax valuation allowance  therefore  is no longer applicable 
as a result  the company reduced the remaining valuation allowance to zero at december  results of operations the following section of md a compares the results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended december   and and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

this mechanism was implemented in september and  at that time  the company expensed million of pension and pbop costs  which were deferred during the first eight months of see critical accounting policies and estimates  pension and other postretirement benefits  in this md a for more information on the mdte order 
nstar in generated million of cash from operations sufficient to fund approximately million of net capital expenditures  and million of cash dividends 
the company s capital expenditures contributed to nstar s solid operational performance in reliability  restoration  and customer service measurements 
favorable market conditions and the company s strong credit ratings contributed to the company s refinancing activities 
these financing activities included the retirement of million of series of debentures in march and a reduction in short term borrowings of million from year end this retirement was temporarily funded with short term borrowings  which were subsequently paid down with the proceeds from the issuance of a year  million series of debentures  which was completed in april energy sales and weather the following is a summary of retail electric and firm gas energy sales for the years indicated years ended december  change retail electric sales mwh residential commercial industrial other total retail sales years ended december  change firm gas sales bbtu residential commercial industrial and other total firm sales 
table of contents in terms of customer sector characteristics  industrial sales are less sensitive to weather than residential and commercial sales which are influenced by temperature extremes 
despite the overall warmer winter weather in  the increase in electric sales is attributable in part to the commercial sector where building expansions created the resulting additional energy use 
electric residential and commercial customers represented approximately and  respectively  of nstar s total sales mix for and provided and of distribution and transmission revenues  respectively 
refer to the electric revenues section below for a more detailed discussion 
industrial sales are primarily influenced by national and local economic conditions and sales to these customers reflect a sluggish economic environment and decreased manufacturing production

operating revenues operating revenues for increased from as follows increase decrease in millions amount percent electric revenues retail distribution and transmission energy  transition and other total retail wholesale total electric revenues gas revenues firm and transportation energy supply and other total gas revenues unregulated operations revenues total operating revenues 
table of contents electric revenues electric retail distribution revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the company s recovery of its capital investment  including a return component  and operation and maintenance related to its electric distribution infrastructure 
the transmission revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the electricity over high voltage lines from the generator to the company s substations 
despite a increase in retail mwh sales  substantially all in the residential and commercial sectors  the decrease in retail distribution and transmission revenues is primarily due to transmission related true up adjustments 
nstar s largest earnings sources are the revenues derived from distribution rates approved by the mdte 
the level of distribution revenues is affected by weather conditions and the economy 
weather conditions affect sales to nstar s residential and small commercial customers 
economic conditions affect nstar s large commercial and industrial customers 
energy  transition and other revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs incurred by the company in order to acquire the energy supply on behalf of its customers and a transition charge for recovery of the company s prior investments in generating plants and the costs related to long term power contracts 
the energy revenues relate to customers being provided energy supply under either standard offer or default service 
energy supply contract prices vary among the nstar electric companies and for standard offer and default service customers 
however  the retail revenues related to standard offer and default services are fully reconciled to the costs incurred and have no impact on nstar s consolidated net income 
furthermore  energy and transition revenues are fully reconciled with the cost currently recognized by the company and  as a result  do not have an effect on the company s earnings 
other revenues primarily relate to the company s ability to effectively reduce stranded costs mitigation incentive  rental revenue from electric property and annual cost reconciliation true up adjustments 
in  the cost reconciliation true up adjustments increased revenues by approximately million 
the million increase in energy  transition and other revenues is primarily attributable to higher rates for default service and standard offer service  which include comelectric and cambridge electric standard offer service fuel index adjustments throughout and for boston edison in the fourth quarter of wholesale revenues relate to services provided to municipalities and certain other governmental authorities 
this decrease in wholesale revenues reflects the expiration of two wholesale power supply contracts in and one contract in after october  nstar electric anticipates it will no longer have contracts for the supply of wholesale power 
amounts collected from wholesale customers are credited to retail customers through the transition charge 
therefore  the expiration of these contracts will have no impact on results of operations 
gas revenues firm and transportation gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for nstar gas recovery of costs of its capital investment in its gas infrastructure  including a return component  and for the recovery of costs for the ongoing operation and maintenance of that infrastructure 
the transportation revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the natural gas over pipelines from gas suppliers to take stations located within nstar gas service area 
the million decrease in firm and transportation revenues is attributable to warmer weather  conservation efforts  the decrease in sales volumes of offset by increased revenues related to carrying costs earned as part of a reconciliation rate adjustment mechanism related to pension and pbop that was approved by the mdte in nstar gas sales are positively impacted by colder weather because a substantial portion of its customer base uses natural gas for space heating purposes 
energy supply and other gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs to the company in order to acquire the natural gas in the marketplace and a charge for recovery of the company s gas 
table of contents supplier service costs 
the current gas rate structure of nstar gas includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred and gas costs billed are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
the revenue increase of million primarily reflects the impact of the higher cost of gas sold that reflected a weighted average cost of gas per therm increase over the same period in of approximately 
these revenues are fully reconciled with the cost currently recognized by the company and  as a result  do not have an effect on the company s earnings 
unregulated operations revenues unregulated operations revenues are derived from nstar s businesses that include district energy operations and telecommunications 
unregulated revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease is primarily the result of the sale of blackstone station to harvard university in april partially offset by an increase in the revenues from electric and chilled water services and higher steam revenues resulting from colder weather and higher fuel costs 
operating expenses purchased power costs were  million for compared to  million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily the result of the higher costs of fuel  partially offset by the recognition of million relating to the additional deferral of standard offer and default service supply costs 
nstar electric adjusts its rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
due to this rate adjustment mechanism  changes in the amount of energy supply expense have no impact on earnings 
the cost of gas sold  representing nstar gas supply expense  was million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
despite the lower volume of firm gas sales of  the revenue increase reflects the higher costs of gas supply 
nstar gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of gas supply contracts  transportation contracts on interstate pipelines  market area storage and peaking services 
however  these expenses are also fully reconciled to the current level of revenues collected and have no impact on earnings 
operations and maintenance expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease primarily reflects the first full year of the company s pension and pbop rate mechanism 
the mechanism was implemented in september and  at that time  the company expensed approximately million of pension and pbop costs  which were deferred during the first eight months of expenses in reflect lower labor and labor related costs as well as the absence in of operation and maintenance costs associated with blackstone station  which was sold in april depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase primarily reflects higher depreciable distribution and transmission plant in service  an increase to the transmission depreciation rate  and increased expense related to software and merger costs to achieve amortization 
dsm and renewable energy programs expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or  which are consistent with the collection of conservation and renewable energy revenues 
these costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by the mdte and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis plus a small incentive return 
property and other taxes were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to higher overall municipal property taxes of million caused primarily by higher assessments 
higher property taxes are primarily due to increased plant investment and increased rates 
table of contents associated with legislation passed in massachusetts allowing for the temporary shift of property tax burdens from residential to commercial property owners  in particular  in the city of boston 
income taxes attributable to operations were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
despite higher pre tax income in  incomes taxes decreased due to the reversal of state tax reserves as a result of resolution of prior audit periods and permanent tax benefits related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the tax benefit related to the act will not impact nstar s results of operations as these tax benefits are incorporated into the company s pension and pbop rate adjustment mechanism 
other income  net other income  net was approximately million in compared to million in  a decrease in other income of million 
the decrease is primarily due to the absence in of the recognition of million in tax benefits related to deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recognized in and the sale of blackstone station to harvard university that resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in  other income includes proceeds from an executive life insurance policy of million  million in employee related contract fees received associated with the operating agreement with harvard university related to blackstone station and higher interest income on investments of million 
other deductions  net other deductions  net were approximately million in compared to million in  including write down of rcn investment  net 
the million decrease in other deductions in was due primarily to the absence of the rcn abandonment charge of million pre tax in interest charges interest on long term debt and transition property securitization certificates was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the retirement of boston edison s million debentures on march  that lowered expense by million  the absence of million of interest expense in resulting from the retirement of boston edison s million debentures in march  and the lower principal balance of transition property securitization certificates outstanding that resulted in reduced interest expense of million 
securitization interest represents interest on debt of bec funding collateralized by the future income stream associated primarily with the stranded costs of the pilgrim unit divestiture 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison 
partially offsetting these interest expense declines was additional interest expense of million on boston edison s million  debenture  issued on april  and an increase in interest expense of million on comelectric s term loan issued on may  million  three year  variable rate  at december  
short term and other interest expense was million in compared to in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in short term and other interest expense primarily relates to a reduction in bank service fees and other charges million resulting from a reduction in the level of nstar s revolving line of credit 
in addition  the decrease in short term and other expenses includes a lower average level of debt outstanding of million as compared to million for and  respectively  slightly offset by higher bank borrowing rates that averaged through december as compared to in the same period in taken together  these factors decreased short term borrowing costs by million 
offsetting these decreases was an increase in regulatory interest due to higher customer deferral balances 
allowance for funds used during construction capitalized interest decreased million  or  in  primarily due to the completion of construction in december of combustion turbines at aes matep facility 

table of contents compared to earnings and operations overview earnings per common share were as follows years ended december  change basic diluted net income was million for compared to million for three factors that contributed to the million  or  increase in earnings include increased retail electric and firm gas sales of and  respectively  as compared to  interest savings on the company s outstanding indebtedness due to lower short term and long term interest and a lower level of borrowing in  as well as a reduction in the impairment charges related to nstar s investment in rcn corporation rcn from to nstar was able to achieve the earnings growth despite an increase in operation and maintenance expenses 
the primary factor for the million increase in these expenses from was higher benefit costs 
these costs were somewhat mitigated  as a result of a mdte order  effective september   which allowed the company to defer approximately million through december  in increased pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
see critical accounting policies and estimates  pension and other postretirement benefits  in this md a for more information on the mdte order 
from a cash flow perspective  nstar generated cash from operations sufficient to fund approximately million of net capital expenditures and approximately million of cash dividends 
in comparison to the prior year  cash from operations decreased primarily due to the timing of the collection of energy costs and increased contributions to nstar s pension and pbop plans 
the company s capital expenditures contributed to nstar s solid operational performance in reliability  restoration  and customer service measurements 
these measurements are reflected in nstar s mdte service quality indicator filings  which indicated that nstar has exceeded its service quality measures and  therefore  not subject to penalties for both and cash expended for financing activities primarily reflect the payment of debt service requirements and dividends to shareholders

table of contents electric revenues electric retail distribution revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the company s recovery of its capital investment  including a return component  and operation and maintenance related to its electric distribution infrastructure 
the transmission revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the electricity over high voltage lines from the generator to the company s substations 
the increase in retail revenues primarily reflects the increase in retail mwh sales 
retail electric revenues for also include approximately million in carrying charges on the company s average net prepaid pension and pbop balances  as allowed under an order from the mdte in nstar s largest earnings sources are the revenues derived from distribution rates approved by the mdte 
the level of distribution revenues is affected by weather conditions and the economy 
weather conditions affect sales to nstar s residential and small commercial customers 
economic conditions affect nstar s large commercial and industrial customers 
energy  transition and other revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs incurred by the company in order to acquire the energy supply on behalf of its customers and a transition charge for recovery of the company s prior investments in generating plants and the costs related to long term power contracts 
the energy supply revenues relate to customers being provided energy supply under either standard offer or default service 
energy supply contract prices vary among the nstar electric companies and for standard offer and default service customers 
however  the retail revenues related to standard offer and default services are fully reconciled to the costs incurred and have no impact on nstar s consolidated net income 
furthermore  energy and transition revenues are fully reconciled with the cost currently recognized by the company and  as a result  do not have an effect on the company s earnings 
other revenues primarily relate to the company s ability to effectively reduce stranded costs mitigation incentive and rental revenue from electric property 
wholesale revenues relate to services provided to municipalities and certain other governmental authorities 
this decrease in wholesale revenues reflects the expiration of two wholesale power supply contracts in and three other contracts during after october   nstar electric will no longer have contracts for the supply of wholesale power 
amounts collected from wholesale customers are credited to retail customers through the transition charge 
therefore  the expiration of these contracts will have no impact on results of operations 
in october  a municipal wholesale electric contract expired resulting in a decline in wholesale revenues and sales 
gas revenues firm and transportation gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for nstar gas recovery of costs of its capital investment in its gas infrastructure  including a return component  and for the recovery of costs for the ongoing operation and maintenance of that infrastructure 
the transportation revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the natural gas over pipelines from gas suppliers to take stations located within nstar gas service area 
the million increase in firm and transportation revenues is attributable to the increase in energy sales due to the significantly colder winter weather  and additional customers 
firm gas revenues also include approximately million in carrying charges on the company s average net prepaid pension and pbop balances  as allowed under an order from the mdte in nstar gas sales are positively impacted by colder weather because a substantial portion of its customer base uses natural gas for space heating purposes 
energy supply and other gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs to the company in order to acquire the natural gas in the marketplace and a charge for recovery of the company s gas supplier service costs 
this revenue increase of million primarily reflects the higher costs of gas supply that reflected a weighted average cost of gas per therm increase over of approximately 
these revenues are fully reconciled with the cost currently recognized by the company and  as a result  do not have an effect on the company s earnings 

table of contents unregulated operations revenues unregulated operations revenues are derived from nstar s businesses that include district energy operations  telecommunications  and liquefied natural gas service 
unregulated revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in unregulated revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the rates for electric and chilled water services and higher steam revenues resulting from the significantly colder weather and higher fuel costs 
operating expenses purchased power costs were  million for compared to  million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily the result of increased sales and the higher costs of fuel  partially offset by the recognition of million relating to the deferred standard offer and default service supply costs for current period under collection of these costs 
nstar electric adjusts its rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
due to the rate adjustment mechanisms  changes in the amount of energy supply expense have no impact on earnings 
the cost of gas sold  representing nstar gas supply expense  was million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to recognition of the higher costs of gas supply and the significant increase in sales 
nstar gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of gas supply contracts  transportation contracts on interstate pipelines  market area storage and peaking services 
however  these expenses are also fully reconciled to the current level of revenues collected 
operations and maintenance expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase primarily reflects a higher overall level of pension and pbop costs of approximately million 
this increase was somewhat mitigated  effective september   as a result of a mdte order  which allowed nstar to defer approximately million through december  of the increased pension and other postretirement benefits expense 
this increase was partially offset by the reduction in operations and maintenance expense as the company benefited from improvements made in electric distribution services in and overall cost reduction initiatives in also  bad debt expense increased by million due to higher retail revenue and receivables outstanding 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily reflects the absence in of million in accelerated amortization of regulatory assets associated with the seabrook generating unit sale in  partially offset by higher depreciable plant in service 
dsm and renewable energy programs expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  which are consistent with the collection of conservation and renewable energy revenues 
these costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by the mdte and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis plus a small incentive return 
property and other taxes were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to higher overall municipal property taxes of million caused primarily by higher property assessments  capital additions and tax rates in the city of boston  partially offset by lower payroll charges 
income taxes attributable to operations were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or  reflecting higher pre tax operating income in and the absence of tax benefits related to the sale of the seabrook generating unit in  which reduced income tax expense by approximately million in 
table of contents other income  net other income  net was million in compared to million in  a decrease in other income of million 
the decrease in income was due primarily to the absence of million in gains realized in on the sale of demutualized insurance company common shares and the recognition of investment tax credits of million as a result of the sale of the seabrook generating unit in  offset by the incremental benefit recognized related to deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recognized in of approximately million 
also  in  other income  net includes the sale of blackstone station that resulted in a pretax gain of million 
other deductions  net other deductions  net  including write down of rcn investment  net  were million in and million in in addition to the million and the million write downs of the rcn investment in and  other deductions in amounted to million 
the million increase in other deductions in was due primarily to the rcn abandonment charge of million pre tax 
offsetting this increase was the absence in of a million accrual for shutdown costs recorded in for the northwind district energy facility for expected equipment removal costs 
interest charges interest on long term debt and transition property securitization certificates was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase in interest expense primarily reflects the impact of the october  boston edison issuance of million of year debentures and million of year floating rate debentures priced at three month libor plus basis points at december  
also  contributing to this increase was comelectric s issuance of a million variable rate at december  term loan on may  these new debt issuances increased interest expense by million in partially offsetting these increases was the absence in of million in interest due to boston edison s early redemption of its million debentures in september and its million debentures retired in march and scheduled repayments of its transition property securitization certificates of million that resulted in reduced interest expense of million 
securitization interest represents interest on debt collateralized by the future income stream associated primarily with the stranded costs of the pilgrim unit divestiture 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison 
short term and other interest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to both lower borrowing rates and a lower average level of short term debt outstanding that averaged million and million in and  respectively 
interest rates on these borrowings averaged and for and  respectively 
the increase in long term debt interest expense and the decrease in short term debt interest expense is primarily due to the fact that nstar has refinanced some short term debt with long term debt in order to take advantage of favorable interest rates 
allowance for funds used during construction capitalized interest increased million  or  primarily due to a higher average balance of construction work in progress during the year due to the construction of new combustion turbines at aes matep facility 
liquidity and capital resources a major driver to nstar s liquidity is the level of plant expenditures 
plant expenditures currently forecasted for are million  consisting of approximately million for electric and gas operations and million for capital requirements of non utility ventures 
the plant expenditure level over the following four years is currently forecasted to aggregate approximately billion 

table of contents forecasted plant expenditures include nstar s kv transmission project that  in the aggregate  is expected to total million 
a significant portion of these costs will be incurred in and nstar has obtained regulatory approval to construct a kv transmission line from stoughton  massachusetts  a southern suburb of boston  to south boston in order to assure continued reliability of service and improve power import capacity in the northeast massachusetts area nema 
construction is set to begin in the first quarter of  subject to final permitting 
the new transmission line is anticipated to be placed in service during the summer of this project is a regional transmission investment and  as a result  the cost will be shared by all of new england and recovered in rates by nstar through wholesale and retail transmission rates 
in addition to plant expenditures  nstar s primary estimated uses of cash for each of the years presented below include long term debt principal and interest payments  minimum lease commitments  electric contractual capacity charge obligations  natural gas contractual agreements and purchase power contract buy out restructuring obligations 
in millions years thereafter total long term debt interest obligation on long term debt transition property securitization interest obligation on transition property securitization leases electric capacity obligations gas contractual obligations purchase power buy out obligations reflects securities issued by bec funding llc  a subsidiary of boston edison 
bec funding llc recovers the principal and interest obligations for its transition property securitization bonds from customers of boston edison through a component of boston edison s transition charge and  as a result  these payment obligations do not affect nstar s overall cash flow 
during the first half of  nstar expects to issue additional transition property securitization bonds through bec funding ii  llc  a subsidiary of boston edison and cec funding  llc  a subsidiary of comelectric 
this new obligation is not included in the table above as the exact amount of the obligation and the resulting yearly principal and interest payment requirements are not yet finalized 
reflects obligations for purchase power and the cost of gas 
boston edison  cambridge electric and comelectric recover capacity and buy out restructuring obligations from customers through a component of their transition charges and  as a result  these payment obligations do not affect nstar s overall cash flow 
nstar gas recovers its contractual obligations from customers through its seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause and  as a result  these payment obligations do not affect nstar s overall cash flow 
current cash flow activity operating activities in provided million of cash 
the company used million in its investing activities  primarily to fund million of plant expenditures  which included system reliability infrastructure improvement projects incurred by nstar electric and nstar gas operations 
additionally  the company used million in financing activities to primarily fund million of dividends 
operating activities the net cash provided by operating activities increased million from to million 
major drivers to cash provided by operating activities are working capital and energy cost recoveries 
from a working capital perspective  accounts payable increased approximately million due to the timing of energy supply 
table of contents invoices and company benefit plan contributions decreased approximately million year to year 
nstar contributed approximately million to its pension plan and approximately million to its other postretirement benefit plans in nstar currently anticipates that it will contribute approximately million to its pension plan and approximately million to its other postretirement benefit plans in offsetting the positive working capital components were decreased energy cost recoveries year to year by approximately million 
there is no impact to earnings  as energy costs are fully recoverable from customers through the transition charge 
during and  nstar has benefited from bonus depreciation for income tax purposes between and depreciation on new capital additions 
as a result  nstar s deferred income taxes have increased 
as of december   the bonus depreciation rules have generally expired 
therefore  in and beyond  the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation will be limited to certain qualified projects 
investing activities the net cash used in investing activities in of million consists primarily of capital expenditures related to infrastructure investments in transmission and distribution systems 
financing activities the net cash used in financing activities in of million reflects long term debt redemptions and sinking funds payments of million  dividends paid of million and a reduction in short term borrowings since december of million as a result of the million financing by boston edison in april nstar s banking arrangements provide for daily cash transfers to our disbursement accounts as vendor checks are presented for payment and where the right of offset does not exist among accounts 
changes in the balances of the disbursement accounts are reflected in financing activities in the accompanying statement of cash flows 
additionally  beginning in august  nstar began issuing common shares for cash as part of its dividend reinvestment and direct common shares purchase plan 
as of december   nstar has issued approximately  common shares and has received approximately million as a result of the plan 
short term financing activities nstar s short term debt decreased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the proceeds of the million financing being used to pay down short term debt balances 
previously  on march   boston edison redeemed the entire million aggregate principal amount of its debentures due march  the redemption included payment of an approximate million premium plus accrued interest 
long term financing activities in  nstar electric initiated a process to auction off certain purchase power agreements under which nstar electric had entitlements to approximately  mw of capacity under long term contracts with non utility generators 
the auction was intended to further nstar electric s efforts to mitigate stranded costs  which continue to be recovered from customers 
one contract in which nstar electric had entitlements to approximately mw of the  mw of capacity  originally included in the auction  expired on december  also in  nstar electric executed agreements to buy out or restructure twelve of its 
table of contents purchase power agreements 
these buy out restructuring agreements provide no economic benefit to nstar electric and  therefore  the agreements contract termination costs will be recorded on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these agreements constitute approximately mw of the  mw of capacity  originally included in the auction  and reduce the amount of nstar electric s future exposure to the above market costs that nstar electric will collect from its customers through its transition charges 
as of december   four of these agreements have received mdte approval and have been recognized 
two of the four agreements require nstar electric to make monthly payments through december totaling approximately million 
the other two agreements require nstar electric to make monthly payments through september totaling approximately million 
on january   nstar electric received approval from the mdte for an additional four agreements that are anticipated to be completed by february these four agreements were binding as of december  but were contingent upon regulatory approval 
since the contingency has been removed during february  nstar recorded the contract termination costs as of december  one of the four agreements requires nstar electric to make net monthly payments through september totaling approximately million 
the other three agreements require nstar electric to make net monthly payments through september totaling approximately million 
nstar electric anticipates making these cash payments from funds generated from operations and will be fully recovered through nstar electric s transition charge 
the total amount currently recognized for obligations relating to eight of the twelve contracts is approximately million in present day dollars  approximately million as a component of current liabilities power contracts and million as a component of deferred credits power contracts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
nstar electric has recorded a corresponding regulatory asset to reflect the full future recovery of these payments through its transition charge 
this recognition represents a non cash increase in assets and liabilities 
also in january  the mdte approved the remaining four contracts with two suppliers that reduced the overall amount of transition costs to be paid for above market contracts 
the four contracts with the two suppliers are buy out arrangements whereby nstar electric has committed to pay amounts for the full release of its obligation under previous purchase power agreements 
on august   nstar electric filed with the mdte a proposed financing plan that seeks approval for full recovery of these buy out costs and the issuance of million in transition property securitization bonds to provide the funds for these four buy out agreements 
the mdte approved the financing plan in january on february   the bonds were priced at a weighted average yield of 
nstar expects the securitization financing to close in march management continuously reviews its capital expenditure and financing programs 
these programs and  therefore  the forecasts included in nstar s form k are subject to revision due to changes in regulatory requirements  operating requirements  environmental standards  availability and cost of capital  interest rates and other assumptions 
sources of additional capital and financial covenant requirements nstar and boston edison have no financial covenant requirements under their respective long term debt arrangements

table of contents in november  nstar restructured its three year  million revolving credit agreement that was set to expire on november  into a five year  million revolving credit agreement that expires in november at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under the current and previous revolving credit agreement 
this credit facility serves as a backup to nstar s million commercial paper program that  at december  and  had million and million outstanding  respectively 
under the terms of the current credit agreement  nstar is required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than at all times  excluding transition property securitization certificates  and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity 
the previous arrangement also required nstar to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not less than to for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount 
at december  and  nstar was in full compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants 
in december  boston edison filed a shelf registration with the sec to allow boston edison to issue up to million in debt securities 
the registration became effective on january  on april   the mdte approved the issuance by boston edison of up to million of debt securities from time to time on or before december  on april   boston edison sold million of ten year fixed rate debentures under this shelf registration 
the net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding short term debt balances 
as of september   boston edison has approval from the ferc to issue short term debt securities from time to time on or before december   with maturity dates no later than december   in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed million at any one time 
in addition  in november  boston edison restructured its million revolving credit agreement that expired in november into a five year  million revolving credit agreement that expires in november however  unless boston edison receives necessary approvals from the mdte  the credit agreement will expire days from the date of the first draw under the agreement

in addition  as of december   comelectric  cambridge electric and nstar gas  collectively  have million available under several lines of credit and had million and million outstanding under these lines of credit at december  and  respectively 
as of september   comelectric and cambridge electric have ferc authorization to issue short term debt securities from time to time on or before november  and june   with maturity dates no later than november  and june   respectively  in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed million and million  respectively  at any one time 
nstar gas is not required to seek approval from ferc to issue short term debt 
on june   nstar filed an s registration statement with the sec for the purpose of registering two million common shares in connection with the nstar dividend reinvestment and direct common shares purchase plan 
the registration statement became effective on july  since the effective date  nstar has issued approximately  shares under this registration and received approximately million 
additionally  nstar issued approximately  shares as part of its share incentive plan 
no cash was received from this issuance 
on december   nstar announced its intention to split its common shares two for one  subject to market conditions and shareholder approval of an amendment to the company s declaration of trust that would 
table of contents increase the number of nstar s authorized common shares  at the april  annual meeting of shareholders 
historically  nstar and its subsidiaries have had a variety of external sources of financing available  as indicated above  at favorable rates and terms to finance its external cash requirements 
however  the availability of such financing at favorable rates and terms depends heavily upon prevailing market conditions and nstar s or its subsidiaries financial condition and credit ratings 
an adverse change in nstar s or its subsidiaries credit ratings or market conditions could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions upon which nstar or its subsidiaries have access to capital markets 
currently  nstar and its subsidiaries have a level ratings at standard poor s  moody s and fitch ratings with a stable outlook for nstar and its subsidiaries 
nstar has no financial guarantees  commitments  debt or lease agreements that would require a change in terms and conditions  such as acceleration of payment obligations  as a result of a change in its credit rating 
however  nstar s subsidiaries could be required to provide additional security for power supply contract performance  such as a letter of credit for their pro rata share of the remaining value of such contracts 
refer to performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements and financial and performance guarantees as disclosed in this md a 
nstar s goal is to maintain a capital structure that preserves an appropriate balance between debt and equity 
based on nstar s key cash resources available as discussed above  management believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its current and projected requirements 
other events on july   mirant corporation and certain of its subsidiaries mirant filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
mirant currently supplies  among other services  standard offer service for approximately of nstar electric s standard offer load 
should mirant fail to perform under this agreement  nstar electric would be required to seek replacement energy supply to meet its standard offer obligation 
nstar s current expectation is that mirant will continue to perform under its agreements with nstar  and  as a result  nstar does not expect the mirant bankruptcy to have a material impact to its earnings or cash flows 
performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements nstar electric has contracted with a third party supplier to provide of its standard offer service supply obligations through february  in addition  nstar electric has entered into a number of short term power purchase agreements to meet its entire default service supply obligation  other than large customers  for the period january  through june  and for of its obligation  other than large customers  for the second half of nstar electric has entered into a number of short term power purchase agreements to meet its entire default service supply obligation for large customers through march these agreements are for a term of three to twelve months 
nstar electric currently is recovering payments it is making to suppliers from its customers 
most of nstar electric s power suppliers are either investment grade companies or are subsidiaries of larger companies with investment grade or better credit ratings 
in accordance with nstar s internal credit policy  and to minimize nstar electric risk in the event the supplier encounters financial difficulties or otherwise fails to perform  nstar has financial assurances and guarantees that include both parental guarantees and letters of credit in place from the parent company of the supplier 
in addition  under these agreements  in the event that the supplier or its parent guarantor fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating  it is required to provide additional security for performance of its obligations 
in view of current volatility in the energy supply industry  nstar electric is unable to determine whether its suppliers or their parent guarantors will become subject to financial difficulties  or whether these financial assurances and guarantees are sufficient 
in the event the supplier or its guarantor does not provide the required additional security within the required time frames  nstar electric may then terminate the agreement 
in such event  nstar may be 
table of contents required to secure alternative sources of supply at higher or lower prices than provided under the terminated agreements 
some of these agreements include a reciprocal provision  where in the event that an nstar electric distribution company receives a downgrade  that company could be required to provide additional security for performance  such as a letter of credit 
virtually all of nstar gas firm gas supply agreements are short term less than one year and utilize market based  monthly indexed pricing mechanisms so the financial risk to the company would be minimal if a supplier were to fail to perform 
however  in the event that a firm supplier does fail to perform under its firm gas supply agreement pricing provisions  the company would be entitled to any positive difference between the monthly supply price and the cost of replacement supplies 
the cost of gas procured for firm gas sales customers is recovered through a semi annual cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
under mdte regulations  interim adjustments to the cost of gas may also be requested when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 
nstar gas continually evaluates the financial stability of current and prospective gas suppliers 
firm suppliers are required to have and maintain investment grade credit ratings or financial assurances and guarantees that include both parental guarantees and letters of credit in place from the parent company of the supplier and the firm gas supply agreements allow either party to require financial assurance  or  if necessary  contract termination in the event that either party is downgraded below investment grade level and is unable to provide financial assurance acceptable to nstar gas 
financial and performance guarantees on a limited basis  nstar and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties 
such agreements include letters of credit  surety bonds  and other guarantees 
at december   outstanding guarantees totaled million as follows in thousands letters of credit surety bonds other guarantees total guarantees the million letter of credit is for the benefit of a third party  as trustee in connection with the notes of one of nstar s subsidiaries 
the letter of credit is available if the subsidiary has insufficient funds to pay the debt service requirements 
as of december   there have been no amounts drawn under this letter of credit 
as of december   certain of nstar s subsidiaries have purchased a total of million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses  permits and rights of way in various municipalities 
in addition  nstar and certain of its subsidiaries has purchased approximately million in workers compensation self insurer bonds 
these bonds support the guarantee by nstar and certain of its subsidiaries to the commonwealth of massachusetts required as part of the company s workers compensation self insurance program 
nstar and its subsidiaries have also issued million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the hydro quebec transmission companies 
management believes the likelihood nstar would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote 

table of contents contingencies environmental matters as of december   nstar s subsidiaries are involved in four state regulated properties massachusetts contingency plan  or mcp sites where oil or other hazardous materials were previously spilled or released 
the nstar subsidiaries are required to clean up or otherwise remediate these properties in accordance with specific state regulations 
there are sometimes uncertainties associated with total remediation costs due to the final selection of the specific cleanup technology and the particular characteristics of the different sites 
estimates of approximately million and million are included as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
in addition to the mcp sites  nstar subsidiaries also face possible liability as a result of involvement in multi party disposal sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation 
nstar generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for these sites 
estimates of approximately million are included as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and the mcp and multi party disposal site amounts have not been reduced by any potential rate recovery treatment of these costs or any potential recovery from nstar s insurance carriers 
prospectively  should nstar be allowed to collect these specific costs from customers  it would record an offsetting regulatory asset and record a credit to operating expenses equal to previously expensed costs 
nstar gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of five former manufactured gas plant mgp sites and alleged mgp waste disposal locations to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and whether nstar gas may be responsible for remedial action 
the mdte has approved recovery of costs associated with mgp sites over a year period  without carrying costs 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded a liability of approximately million and million  respectively  as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several mgp sites for which nstar gas was previously cited as a potentially responsible party 
a corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded that reflects the future rate recovery for these costs 
estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted periodically as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or nstar s responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved 
nstar s ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates 
based on nstar s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities  existing legal requirements and regulatory policies  nstar does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on nstar s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows for a reporting period 
employees and employee relations as of december   nstar had approximately  employees  including approximately  or  who are represented by three units covered by separate collective bargaining contracts 
nstar s contract with local of the utility workers union of america  afl cio  which represents approximately  employees  expires on may  management has begun discussions with union officials for local for a new labor contract
