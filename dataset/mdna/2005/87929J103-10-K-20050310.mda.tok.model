item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
our most significant estimates relate to accounting for our percentage of completion and proportional performance contracts  accounts receivable reserve  evaluating goodwill for impairment  the realizability and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  and contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition for our software contracts with multiple elements  revenue recognition for our contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion and proportional performance methods  revenue recognition for the operations of our acquisitions  accounts receivable reserves  capitalized software development costs  acquired intangible assets  goodwill impairment  stock compensation expense  and income taxes 
we describe these accounting policies in relevant sections of this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview and recent developments effective january   we purchased the enterprise mobility solutions business unit of aether systems  inc this unit brought to us a base of over  enterprise customers and wireless data applications for logistics  financial services and the mobile office 
on september   we acquired substantially all of the assets of kivera  inc  a provider of internet based location application software and geo data professional services 
this acquisition represented a buy vs 
build opportunity  as kivera s software platform integrates easily with existing wireless carrier network elements and our xypoint location platform xlp 
effective in the fourth quarter of  we realigned our business across two market segments more closely aligned with how the company now operates i our commercial applications segment  which consists principally of enhanced communication services to and from wireless phones  location application software  our e application and other hosted services  and subscriber based data services and ii our government segment  which includes the design  development and deployment of information processing and communication systems and related services to government agencies 
the information in this section presents our historical information restated to conform with our current operating segments 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that our management believes to be necessary to achieve a clear understanding of our financial statements and results of operations 
our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
those indicators include revenue 
we derive revenue from products and services including recurring monthly service and subscriber fees  software licenses and related service fees for the design  development  and 
table of contents deployment of software and communication systems  and products and services derived from the delivery of information processing and communication systems to governmental agencies 
cost of revenue 
the major items comprising our cost of revenue are compensation and benefits  third party hardware and software  amortization of software development costs  and overhead expenses 
the costs of hardware and third party software are primarily associated with the delivery of systems  and fluctuate from period to period as a result of the relative volume  mix of projects  level of service support required and the complexity of customized products and services delivered 
amortization of software development costs  including acquired technology  is associated with the recognition of hosted and subscriber revenue and systems from our commercial applications segment 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are primarily compensation and benefits  professional fees  facility costs  marketing and sales related expenses  and travel costs as well as certain non cash expenses such as non cash stock compensation expense  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
liquidity and cash flows 
the primary driver of our cash flows is the results of our operations 
important sources of our liquidity have been cash raised from our january and august financings in connection with our recent acquisitions as described below under liquidity and capital resources  and borrowings under our bank credit agreement and lease financings secured for the purchase of equipment 
balance sheet 
we view cash  working capital  and accounts receivable balances and days revenues outstanding as important indicators of our financial health 
results of operations revenue and cost of revenue the following discussion addresses the revenue and cost of revenue for the two segments of our business

hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenue and cost of revenue our hosted offerings include our e  hosted position determining entity pde and hosted location based service hlbs applications 
revenue from these offerings primarily consists of monthly recurring service fees and is recognized in the month earned 
e  pde  and hlbs service fees are priced based on units served during the period  such as the number of customer subscribers served  the number of connections to public service answering points psaps  or the number of customer cell sites served 
in  we continued to increase the number of carriers and carrier billable units served 
this increase was partly offset by decreases in the average fee received per unit under pricing arrangements with some customers 
in  we expedited the deployment of psaps related to all our customers resulting in an increase in the average number of psaps served by approximately  or 
additionally  in we signed additional wireless carriers to the e service and deployed hosted pde and hlbs applications 
in  we added wireless carrier customers and experienced a increase in volume 
all of our subscriber revenue is generated by the businesses we acquired in  and the year over year increase in total commercial applications segment revenue was due primarily to the revenue generated by the operations acquired in the enterprise acquisition enterprise business 
we generate subscriber revenues from subscriptions to services for blackberry network access and real time market data information accessed via wireless devices as well as services using our client software applications such as traffic matters tm and friend finder 

table of contents maintenance fees on our systems and software licenses are collected in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
unrecognized maintenance fees are included in deferred revenue 
custom software development  implementation and maintenance services may be provided under time and materials or fixed fee contracts 
the direct costs of maintenance revenue consist primarily of compensation and benefits 
the direct cost of our hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenue consists primarily of network access  data feed and circuit costs  compensation and benefits  equipment and software maintenance 
in  we added the direct costs of providing the subscriber services provided by our acquired enterprise business 
also  labor and circuit costs for our network operations centers increased proportionately to the increased number of psaps and cell sites  and we incurred higher facilities expense related to renovations and enhancements to our principal network operations center 
for the year ended december   the cost of airtime  circuit costs  access fees  and data feeds accounted for approximately of the total direct costs of our commercial hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenues 
cost of revenue in increased over due to a increase in headcount for our hosted operations  as well as higher costs for temporary contract staff to meet customer deployment deadlines imposed by the federal communications commission 
this increase in headcount during was partially offset by a reduction in circuit costs that resulted from renegotiating several contracts during the year 
prior to the acquisition of our subscriber operations  circuit costs and other data access costs accounted for approximately of the total direct costs of hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenues in the composition of direct costs was similar to in systems revenue and cost of revenue we sell communications systems for enhanced services to wireless carriers  and we sell asset tracking and proof of delivery mobile asset management systems to enterprise customers 
these systems are based on our licensed software applications 
licensing fees for our software are a function of the number of subscribers or other measure of usage in our customer s network 
as a carrier s subscriber base or usage increases  the carrier must purchase additional capacity under its license agreement and we receive additional revenue 
systems typically contain multiple elements  which may include the product license  installation  integration  and hardware 
the total arrangement fee is allocated among each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fair value is generally determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of evidence of fair value of a delivered element  revenue is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on fair value and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the software licenses are generally perpetual licenses for a specified number of users that allow for the purchase of annual maintenance at a specified rate 
generally  we recognize license fee revenue when each of the following has occurred evidence of an arrangement is in place  we have delivered the software  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
software projects that require significant customization are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
we measure progress to completion using costs incurred compared to estimated total costs 
we recognize estimated losses under long term contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
software license fees billed and not recognized as revenue are included in deferred revenue 
in  revenue from commercial applications systems sales increased compared to primarily due to the inclusion of enterprise systems revenue and a large purchase of increased license capacity by a major carrier during the second quarter of these revenues decreased in from primarily because new business was not booked to replace revenue generated from a large contract to deliver a location platform for multiple carrier networks in europe and the pacific 
we have also historically sold systems through our channel relationship with lucent 
this sales process typically includes participation of our engineers along with original equipment manufacturers in presenting our products to prospective customers 
lucent pays us initial license fees ranging from to of the revenue it generates from sales of the smsc application that we developed under our development agreement 
for sales of our wig  lucent pays us initial fees ranging between and of the sale value which we negotiate on a case by case basis 

table of contents the direct cost of our systems consists primarily of compensation  benefits  purchased equipment  third party software  travel expenses  and consulting fees as well as the amortization of both acquired and capitalized software development costs 
in  such costs consisted primarily of compensation  benefits  third party hardware and software  and million of amortization of software development costs 
in  such costs primarily included compensation  benefits  travel and consulting fees plus million of amortization of software development costs  which included the accelerated amortization recorded during the year 
the composition of direct costs was similar to in  except that direct costs in included only million of amortization of software development costs 
hardware revenue from sales of blackberry devices is included in systems revenue 
for  these hardware sales comprised approximately of total hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenues 
the direct cost of these hardware sales is almost exclusively comprised of third party purchased hardware and shipping expenses

systems revenue and cost of revenue we generate government systems revenue from the design  development  assembly and deployment of information processing and communication systems  primarily deployable communications systems  and integration of those systems into customer networks 
examples of recent government system sales include delivery of our swiftlink products  which are lightweight  secure  deployable communications systems  to units of the us departments of state  justice  and defense 
our government segment also operates teleport facilities for data connectivity via satellite to and from north and south america  as well as africa and europe 
the cost of our systems revenue consists of compensation  benefits  travel  satellite space segment and airtime and costs related to purchased equipment components  which we purchase as needed for customer contracts  and the costs of third party contractors that we engage 
these equipment and third party costs comprise approximately of the total direct costs of systems revenue 

table of contents services revenue and cost of revenue government service revenue primarily consists of communications engineering  program management  help desk outsource  network design and management to government agencies 
most such services are delivered under time and materials contracts 
for fixed price service contracts  we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method 
we recognize estimated losses on contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total labor hours or costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
the direct cost of service revenue consists of compensation  benefits and travel incurred in delivering these services 
the year over year changes in overall government systems and services business were as follows 
in  a decline in volume of system sales  due to a change in customer preferences observed in the second half of the year  was partly offset by increased service revenue 
the effect of lower revenue was partly offset by higher average gross margins due to cost savings as a result of established vendor relationships 
in  systems and services revenue increased  and average margins increased over that of  in conjunction with the high sales volumes of our swiftlink products and the corresponding growth of our government business 
we generally provide government products and services under long term contracts 
we recognize contract revenue as billable costs are incurred and for fixed price product delivery contracts using the percentage of completion method or proportional performance method  measured by either total labor hours or total costs incurred compared to total estimated labor hours or costs 
we recognize estimated losses on contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total labor hours or costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
under our contracts with the us government  contract costs  including the allocated indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
we record revenue under these contracts at estimated net realizable amounts 
major customers for   and  customers that accounted for or more of total revenue were verizon wireless and the us government 
for the year ended december   in addition to verizon wireless and the us government  hutchison g also accounted for or more of total revenue 
the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 
revenue backlog total company backlog at january  was million  of which million was in our commercial applications segment and million was in our government segment 
we expect to realize approximately million of this backlog in the next twelve months 
the remaining backlog represents primarily the balance of multi year contracts for our commercial applications segment 
total backlog as of january  was million 
our backlog at any given time may be affected by a number of factors  including contracts being renewed or new contracts being signed before existing contracts are completed 
some of our backlog could be canceled for causes such as late delivery  poor performance  and other factors 
accordingly  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual revenue 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expense 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our research and development expense vs 
vs 
in millions research and development expense percent of revenue our research and development expense consists of compensation  benefits  travel costs  and a proportionate share of facilities and corporate overhead 
the costs of developing software products are expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility 
for new products  technological feasibility is established when an operative version of the computer software product is completed in the same software language as the product to be ultimately marketed  performs all the major functions planned for the product  and has successfully completed initial customer testing 
technological feasibility for enhancements to an existing product is established when a detail program design is completed 
we incur research and development costs to enhance existing packaged software products as well as to create new software products including software hosted in our network operations center 
these costs primarily include compensation and benefits as well as costs associated with using third party laboratory and testing resources 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred unless technological feasibility has been reached and marketability is certain 
the expenses we incurred relate to software applications which are being marketed to new and existing customers on a global basis 
in  research and development was primarily focused on cellular and hosted location based applications  blending the technology of our existing products while incorporating aspects from our acquisitions  and enhancing client deliverables 
in  we primarily focused on expanded functionality of our location platform software while in such expenditures were primarily incurred in the development of our wireless messaging gateway and hosted e applications 
management continually assesses our spending on research and development to ensure resources are focused on products that are expected to achieve the highest level of success 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared to is primarily a function of the costs incurred related to development efforts by the engineers added via the enterprise and kivera acquisitions 
for our software research and development projects in and  we have determined that technological feasibility is reached shortly before general availability for release 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and  accordingly  we have expensed all research and development expenses as incurred 
sales and marketing expense the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our sales and marketing expenses vs 
vs 
in millions sales and marketing expense percent of total revenue our sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits  trade show expenses  travel costs  advertising and public relations costs as well as a proportionate share of facility related costs which are expensed as incurred 
our marketing efforts also include speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences 
we sell our software products and services through our direct sales force and through indirect channels 
we have also historically leveraged our relationship with original equipment manufacturers to market our software products to wireless carrier customers 
we sell our products and services to the us government primarily through direct sales professionals 
sales and marketing costs increased in as a 
table of contents result of costs incurred for our enterprise market 
in  such costs decreased from largely due to reduced headcount and the alignment of resources with products and services to more effectively target certain markets 
such costs may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on spending on tradeshows and variable compensation based on level of revenue 
general and administrative expense the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our general and administrative expense vs 
vs 
in millions general and administrative expense percent of total revenue general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs and other costs associated with management  finance  human resources and internal information systems 
these costs include compensation  benefits  professional fees  travel  and a proportionate share of rent  utilities and other facilities costs which are expensed as incurred 
the increase in was primarily attributable to increased costs to support our newly acquired enterprise and kivera operations  and the remainder of the increase was related to the costs of complying with the sarbanes oxley act  increased legal fees as well as hiring bonuses paid to employees acquired in the acquisitions 
in such costs were lower than in largely due to savings realized through reduced headcount and reduced professional fees 
non cash stock compensation expense the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our non cash stock compensation expense vs 
vs 
in millions non cash stock compensation expense during the second and third quarters of  we granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock to employees and directors at an exercise price less than the fair market value of our class a common stock at the date of grant 
net loss  as reported  includes   and  of non cash stock compensation expense related to these grants for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to record future stock compensation expense of as a result of these option grants that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of one year 
in the second quarter of  we issued restricted stock to directors and certain key executives 
the restrictions expired at the end of one year for directors and expire in annual increments over three years for executives and are based on continued employment 
the fair value of the restricted stock at issuance has been recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized to non cash stock compensation expense using the straight line method over the period during which the restrictions expire 
net loss  as reported  includes   and of non cash stock compensation expense related to these grants for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to record future stock compensation expense of as a result of these restricted stock grants that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for executives 
as a result of a recent change in the relevant accounting standards  during we will begin to recognize expense for stock options granted to employees at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
we do not currently recognize expense for such options in our consolidated statement of operations 
as described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting this new standard will have on our operating results 

table of contents depreciation and amortization of property and equipment the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our depreciation and amortization of property and equipment vs 
vs 
in millions depreciation and amortization of property and equipment average gross cost of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment represents the period costs associated with our investment in computers  telephony equipment  software  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
we compute depreciation and amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful life of an asset generally ranges from years for furniture  fixtures  and leasehold improvements to years for most other types of assets including computers  software  telephony equipment and vehicles 
expense generally increases year over year as a result of the level of capital expenditures made during the year to support our operations and development efforts 
our depreciable asset base increased significantly in as a result of several major capital projects  including enhancements to and the consolidation of facilities for our network operations center for our commercial applications segment as well as the property and equipment acquired in our two acquisitions during the year 
amortization of acquired intangible assets the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our amortization of acquired intangible assets vs 
vs 
in millions amortization of acquired intangible assets nm the acquired intangible assets associated with the enterprise acquisition and the kivera acquisition are being amortized over their useful lives of between three and nineteen years 
the expense recognized in relates to the intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions  including customer lists  customer contracts  trademarks  and patents 
the expense in and related to the amortization of the xypoint trade name that was amortized based on its estimated useful life of three years using the straight line method and was fully amortized by december  as of october   we performed an annual analysis of our goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the analysis of goodwill included  among other factors  evaluating management s estimates of the future cash flows to be received from the assets

prior to entering several new capital leases near the end of the third quarter of  the balance of our total capital lease obligations decreased consistently from through and  therefore  the related interest expense was also lower 
conversely  interest under the terms of our notes payable are primarily at stated interest rates of and the amount of borrowing under notes payable has increased in the same time period

we currently believe that we have sufficient capital resources and with cash generated from operations as well as cash on hand will meet our anticipated cash operating expenses  working capital  and capital expenditure and debt service needs for the next twelve months 
we have borrowing capacity available to us in the form of capital leases as well as a line of credit arrangement with our bank which expires in april we may also consider raising capital in the public markets as a means to meet our capital needs and to invest in our business 
although we may need to return to the capital markets  establish new credit facilities or raise capital in private transactions in order to meet our capital requirements  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to access these potential sources of funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

table of contents operating cash flows improved in primarily as a result of the cash provided by the changes in working capital compared to the prior year 
changes in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables each provided a more favorable impact on our cash balance during as a result of increased collection efforts initiated by management during the fourth quarter of the year 
the changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue each also had a less significant impact on cash during as a result of the status of certain long term projects that remained open at the end of and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities increased significantly in from as a result of our enterprise and kivera acquisitions described below and increased capital expenditures to support and expand our businesses during the enterprise and kivera acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the cash used for financing activities during  while we spent approximately million for capital expenditures during the year 
net cash used in investing activities also increased in from  primarily as a result of increased capital spending during as well as million of proceeds from notes receivable from employees during these changes were partially offset by decreased capitalized software development costs in due to the completion of certain software development projects that were under development in prior years

these offerings provided net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to fund our acquisitions and for payments under our existing long term debt and capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities increased in from previous year levels as we secured financing to fund our capital expenditure needs while meeting our commitment to repay lease and long term debt obligations

pursuant to this agreement  we raised million in cash through the sale of  shares of our class a common stock 
combined proceeds from both the january and august financings  after financing fees  were approximately million 
as of the same date  we entered into a waiver agreement with the holder of the debenture 
the waiver modified certain provisions of the debenture as follows the holder of the debenture was required to convert the entire million principal amount into shares of our class a common stock by the end of  all of the material restrictive covenants contained in the debenture were nullified and the conversion price set forth in the debenture was decreased from to as an inducement to enter into the waiver an adjustment such that conversion of the debenture will yield an additional  shares of class a common stock 
as additional consideration  we paid the holder of the debenture a million one time fee in cash 
as a result  the entire face amount of the debenture had been converted into shares of our class a common stock as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million

the financial and many other terms of the lease have not yet been established 
the lease is subject to several contingencies and rights of termination 
for example  the lease can be terminated at the sole discretion of our board of directors if the terms and conditions of the development are unacceptable to us  including without limitation the circumstances that market conditions make the lease not favorable to us or the overall cost is not in the best interest to us or our shareholders  or any legal or regulatory restrictions apply
