overview we are a recognized leader in the discovery and development of humanized monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of disease 
all of our revenues are derived from licensing  humanization and royalty arrangements 
during the year ended december   we received royalties on seven marketed products  with approximately of our royalty revenues derived from the herceptin and avastin antibody products marketed by genentech and the synagis antibody product marketed by medimmune 
in september  we entered into a co development and commercialization agreement the collaboration agreement with hoffmann la roche roche for the joint development and commercialization of daclizumab in transplantation  marketed as zenapax for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we and roche will globally co develop daclizumab in asthma  share development expenses and co promote the product in the united states 
outside the united states  we will receive royalties on net sales by roche or its licensees of the product in asthma 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we received a million upfront payment from roche in the third quarter of  and we may receive up to million in development and commercialization milestones in the future for successful further development of daclizumab 
in addition  we receive partial reimbursement from roche related to ongoing research and development efforts under the collaboration agreement 
we determined that all of the elements under the collaboration agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting under eitf as such  and as we have continuing obligations under the collaboration agreement  we recorded the million as deferred revenue and will recognize this amount over the approximately six years that research and development expenses are expected to be performed for roche 
during  we recognized approximately million in license and other revenue related to the amortization of the upfront license fee and the reimbursement of certain research and development expenses 
in january  we entered into a definitive agreement with esp pharma holding company  inc esp  a privately held  hospital focused pharmaceutical company  under which pdl will acquire esp for million in cash and approximately million in pdl common stock  or an aggregate value of approximately million 
in february  this agreement was amended to reflect esp s agreement to acquire from centocor  inc centocor  a biopharmaceutical operating company of johnson johnson  rights to manufacture  develop  market and distribute retavase reteplase in the united states and canada  including an increase in the purchase price by million in cash payable to the esp stockholders at the closing of the esp acquisition 
the acquisition price to be paid to centocor for the rights to retavase is million 
milestone payments of up to million may be made if additional conditions relating to ongoing clinical trials and manufacturing arrangements are satisfied 
in february  we entered into a loan commitment agreement with esp to ensure that the million purchase price payable to centocor would be available to complete the purchase of retavase by esp 
no amount has been drawn under this commitment as of march  the aggregate preliminary purchase price is expected to be approximately million  including the cash to be paid to esp stockholders of million  the fair market value of pdl s common stock to be issued to esp stockholders totaling approximately million  and estimated direct transaction costs of approximately million 
in the event that there is a significant change in our stock price from the announcement of the acquisition to the closing date  we may be required to issue up to an additional million shares of our common stock to esp  which could increase the purchase price by an amount up to million 
we expect this transaction to close during late during the first quarter or early during the second quarter of we currently estimate between and of the aggregate purchase price will be allocated to capitalizable intangible assets and goodwill  with a smaller portion  or approximately  allocated to acquired in process research and development expense 
by adding marketed products and sales and distribution capabilities to our antibody development and humanization technology platform  the esp acquisition is intended to establish pdl as a fully integrated  commercial biopharmaceutical company with novel marketed products  a growing and diverse revenue base and a broad  proprietary pipeline 
the transaction is expected to close late in the first or early in the second quarter of assuming the closing of the acquisition by this anticipated date  we believe that we will achieve positive cash flow from operations on a quarterly basis beginning in the second half of based upon revenues consisting of royalties  license and other income and product sales 
in order to help fund the acquisition of esp  in february  we issued convertible senior notes due february  with a principal amount of million the notes 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all our existing and future indebtedness and may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  beginning on february  at par value 
significant risks in general  we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve sustained profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our expenses will continue to increase over the next several years because of the extensive resource commitments required to identify and develop antibody candidates to achieve regulatory approval and to market potential products for commercial success for any individual product 
also  over the next several years we expect to incur substantial additional expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in research and improve and expand our development and manufacturing capabilities 
our operating expenses may also increase as some of our earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as we invest in additional manufacturing capacity  as we defend or prosecute our patents and patent applications  and as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire esp for an estimated purchase price of approximately million 
in the event that there is a significant change in our stock price from the announcement of the acquisition to the closing date  we may be required to issue additional shares to esp  which could increase the purchase price by an amount up to million 
if the pending transaction closes  the integration of the two companies product rights  technologies  operations and personnel will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and will require significant attention from management and other personnel  which may distract their attention from the day to day business of the combined company 
the diversion of management s attention and any difficulties associated with integrating esp into our organization could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the combined company after the merger and could result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger 
in order to reach our goal to be cash flow positive on a quarterly basis beginning in  we will have to continue to increase sales levels for the key esp products from historical levels  in particular cardene iv  retavase and iv busulfex 
accordingly  we will need to effectively transition existing relationships with distributors  third party vendors  manufacturers and customers of esp 
although we plan to retain the hospital focused sales force and related sales infrastructure  we have never sold  marketed or distributed products  and we may not be able to successfully integrate such capabilities from esp necessary to continue to successfully promote the esp products 
in addition  the markets for cardene iv and retavase are highly competitive  and we will be marketing against pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies with substantially greater revenues and experience in marketing products than we have 
since we or our collaborative partners or licensees may not be able to successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  or successfully market our proprietary products or maintain desired margins for products sold  we may never achieve sustained profitable operations 
the amount of net losses and the time required to reach a sustainable cash flow positive position and profitability are highly uncertain 
in the absence of substantial revenues from increased product sales  new corporate collaborations or patent rights or patent licensing or humanization agreements  significant royalties on sales of products licensed under our intellectual property rights or other sources of revenue  we will continue to incur substantial operating losses 
in addition  as of february  we have approximately million in convertible debt outstanding  approximately million of which are callable in each of and in order to be able to service our debt in the future  we will need to generate positive cash flows from our operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition we currently recognize revenues resulting from the licensing and use of our technology and from services we sometimes perform in connection with the licensed technology 
these revenues are typically derived from our proprietary patent portfolio covering the development  use  sale and importation of humanized antibodies 
we enter into patent license  collaboration and humanization agreements that may contain multiple elements  such as upfront license fees  reimbursement of research and development expenses  milestones related to the achievement of particular stages in product development and royalties 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the aggregate contract value should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  when the associated earnings process is complete and  to the extent the milestone amount relates to our performance obligation  when our licensee confirms that we have met the requirements under the terms of the agreement  and when payment is reasonably assured 
changes in the allocation of the contract value between deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but in any event  would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
for example  as we did not establish fair value for all undelivered elements of the roche collaboration agreement  including milestones and the reimbursement of research and development expenses  we are recognizing the million upfront license fee that we received from roche over the term of the collaboration agreement as services are provided 
in addition  we enter into nonmonetary transactions in connection with our patent licensing arrangements  and management must use estimates and judgments when considering the fair value of the technology rights acquired and the patent licenses granted under these arrangements 
when available  the fair value of the nonmonetary transaction is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each significant element of the patent license agreement 
otherwise  management uses other methods of estimating fair value  such as current pricing information within the company 
therefore  the fair value of the technology right s acquired from the licensee is typically based on the fair value of the patent license and other consideration we exchange with the licensee 
under our humanization agreements  the licensee typically pays an upfront fee for us to humanize an antibody 
these upfront fees are recognized as the humanization work is performed  which is typically over three to six months 
we follow this method because we can reliably estimate the progress of each project based on information from our scientists 
due to our extensive experience in humanizing antibodies  coupled with the short term nature of the humanization contracts  the likelihood that the actual progress is materially different than that reflected in our revenues at the end of any particular reporting period is low 
historically  revenues recognized have approximated actual progress under each humanization agreement 
clinical trial expenses our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential drugs 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events or the successful accrual of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  direct expenses related to each patient enrolled in a clinical trial are recognized on an estimated cost per patient basis as services are performed 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from contract research organizations cros  such as estimated costs per patient  to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial  which we confirm directly with the cro 
our estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from the amounts that may actually be incurred  however  our experience has been that our estimates at the end of any particular reporting period have been materially accurate 
intangible assets the valuation in connection with the initial purchase and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the value ascribed to each asset requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
for example  we estimate future probability adjusted cash flows and certain discount rates as well as assumed commercialization dates for future potential products 
these estimations affect the allocation between charges to acquired in process research and development and capitalization of intangible assets 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for intangible assets 
once the values for intangible assets are established  we must test intangible assets with definite useful lives for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant changes in our underlying business and product candidates or other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
results of operations years ended december   and years ended december  annual percent change in thousands revenues royalties license and other total revenues our total revenues increased in from due to higher royalties and license fees when compared to total revenues increased in from due to higher royalties and license fees when compared to these revenue changes are further discussed below 
royalties royalty revenues recognized under agreements with roche  genentech  medimmune and wyeth have been steadily increasing in and in  the increase was primarily due to increased herceptin sales reported by genentech  higher synagis sales reported by medimmune  and the commercialization of genentech s avastin antibody product during the first quarter of  for which we received royalty payments beginning in the second quarter of royalty payments from medimmune and genentech accounted for and  respectively  of our royalty revenues during in  the increase was primarily due to increased herceptin sales reported by genentech and higher synagis sales reported by medimmune 
royalty payments from medimmune and genentech accounted for and  respectively  of our royalty revenues during we expect that in  based on the continued growth in product sales underlying our royalty revenues  we will continue to experience royalty revenue growth 
we note that in february  biogen idec  inc and elan corp 
announced that they had voluntarily suspended supplying  marketing and selling tysabri  which was approved to treat multiple sclerosis and which is licensed under our humanization patents 
financial analyst and investor expectations previously included potential royalties from the sale of tysabri 
there can be no assurance that tysabri will be returned to the market  the timing of such return  if ever  or that even if subsequently marketed and sold  the product will result in our receiving any significant royalties from the sales of tysabri 
we also continue to expect quarterly fluctuations in royalty revenues due primarily to the seasonality of sales of synagis 
license and other revenues years ended december  in thousands license and other revenues patent rights and licensing humanization and other total license and other revenues the decrease in license and other revenues in was primarily due to the timing of milestone achievement from our licensees and entering into fewer patent licensing agreements in as compared with  partially offset by collaboration revenues of approximately million from roche pursuant to the collaboration agreement signed in the third quarter of in  we entered into three patent licensing agreements  compared to six patent licensing agreements in in addition  in  we recognized million in milestone revenues  compared to million in the increase in license and other revenues in was primarily due to entering into more patent licensing agreements in as compared with as well as higher milestone revenue in as compared with in  we entered into six patent licensing agreements  compared to one patent rights and one patent licensing agreement in in addition  in  we recognized million in milestone revenues  with no such comparable revenues in we expect quarterly fluctuations in license and other revenues depending on the number of new contract arrangements we enter into and milestones achieved by our licensees 
we also expect our license and other revenues to increase in due to a full year of revenue under our roche collaboration agreement 
costs and expenses years ended december annual percent change in thousands costs and expenses research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development total costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development costs include costs of personnel to support our research and development activities  costs of preclinical studies  costs of conducting our clinical trials  such as clinical investigator fees  monitoring costs  data management and drug supply costs  research and development funding provided to third parties and an allocation of facility costs 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of approximately million related to the hiring of additional employees to pursue our expanding research and development programs 
also contributing to the increase were contract manufacturing costs of million  an increase in facility related expenses of million resulting from the expansion of our facilities in  increased in licensing of research and development technology of million  increased outside services of million related primarily to the validation  expansion and upgrade of our information systems infrastructure  and increased amortization of intangible assets of million due to a full year of amortization of assets acquired related to our acquisition of eos biotechnology and technology rights from roche in these increases in costs were partially offset by lower direct clinical and preclinical studies costs for our major research and development projects of approximately million 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of approximately million  in large part resulting from an increase of research and development personnel of approximately employees as a result of the acquisition of eos biotechnology  inc  and the hiring of additional employees to pursue our expanding research and development programs 
also contributing to the increase were additional clinical development activities for our major research and development projects of approximately million and an increase in facility related expenses of million  resulting from the expansion of our facilities in these increases in costs were partially offset by lower research and development funding provided to exelixis of million 
we expect our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we invest in manufacturing  advance our product candidates into later stages of development and add new product candidates  including those to be obtained from the acquisition of esp 
more specifically  the increase is expected to relate primarily to expanded clinical trial activity  including associated direct scale up and manufacturing expenses  and the additional headcount required to execute our clinical trial programs as well as the further expansion of our research  preclinical  manufacturing and process development infrastructure 
below is a summary of products and the related stages of development for each product in clinical development  including the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
product description indication phase of development collaborator estimated completion of phase research and development expenses for the year ended december  in thousands current product candidates daclizumab asthma phase ii roche completed huzaf crohn s disease phase ii nuvion severe steroid refractory ulcerative colitis phase i ii m solid tumors phase ii unknown out license candidates anti il asthma phase iia glaxosmithkline completed anti il autoimmune diseases phase i completed remitogen non hodgkin s b cell lymphoma phase ii completed solid tumors phase i completed zamyl acute myeloid leukemia phase iii completed other total research and development expenses product acquired from eos in april product was returned to glaxosmithkline 
target related intellectual property outlicensed in december further development of these products by pdl is not currently expected  some of these candidates are available for out license 
no single potential clinical product included in other constitutes more than of the total research and development expenses for the period presented 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years and any further estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the if our research efforts are not successful  we may not be able to effectively develop new products  clinical development is inherently uncertain and expensive  and costs may fluctuate unexpectedly  we are subject to extensive government regulation  which requires us to spend significant amounts of money  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals  which are required for us to conduct clinical testing and commercialize our products  our clinical trial strategy may increase the risk of clinical trial difficulties  we may be unable to enroll sufficient patients in a timely manner in order to complete our clinical trials  if our collaborations are not successful  we may not be able to effectively develop and market some of our products  if we do not attract and retain key employees  our business could be impaired  and we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products sections of our risk factors 
restructuring and other charges included in research and development expenses as part of a strategic initiative to centralize our us clinical operations efforts and to improve our efficiency and productivity in the conduct of clinical trials in june  management approved a formal plan pursuant to which we closed our new jersey office  which was principally responsible for the oversight of certain clinical trials 
the plan was a combination of a reduction in workforce of nine employees  which represents less than of the company s total workforce  and the abandonment of our new jersey leased facility 
as a result of the restructuring plan  in we incurred charges of approximately  including adjustments in the fourth quarter of related to the extension of a sublease of the facilities  included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the restructuring charge included approximately  of severance related amounts   of committed cost for our new jersey leased facility  primarily related to rent expenses for the remaining term of the lease  and  related to the net book value of assets that we abandoned 
the estimated cost of abandoning our leased facilities was based on the contractual lease payments from the date of our abandonment of the facility through the term of the lease  which expires in october  partially offset by expected proceeds from a short term sublease entered into during october the workforce reductions were completed by june  we expect to pay the balance of the accrued facility related costs of approximately  at december  through october during  we completed a physical inventory of substantially all of our laboratory equipment at our fremont  california facilities 
as a result  we recorded a charge to research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately  primarily in the second quarter of with minor adjustments in the fourth quarter of  which represents the estimated amount of net book value of assets that are no longer in use 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs include costs of personnel  professional services  patent  consulting and other expenses related to our administrative functions and an allocation of facility costs 
the increase in was primarily related to increased personnel and recruiting costs of million  increased facility related costs of million  costs related to compliance efforts surrounding section of the sarbanes oxley act of of approximately million  and higher stock based compensation expense associated with the continued vesting of certain stock options that had been granted to consultants and former employees of the company of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal costs related to our intellectual property  licensing and other contractual matters of million 
the increase in was primarily related to increased personnel and recruiting costs of million  higher legal costs related to our intellectual property  licensing and other contractual matters of million  increased facility related costs of million  and stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options to non employees in of approximately million 
assuming that the acquisition of esp is completed  we would expect increases in our general and administrative expenses  in addition to sales and marketing expenses  related to the retention of esp s sales force and supportive personnel 
acquired in process research and development eos acquisition in connection with the april acquisition of eos  we recorded charges for acquired in process research and development of million due to eos incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of april  and had no alternative future use as of that date 
a summary and the status of these programs at december  follows program description status of development value assigned in thousands anti angiogenesis m  anti integrin antibody function blocking antibody that targets a specific integrin for solid tumors  including melanoma  pancreatic  non small lung and renal cell cancers phase ii clinical trials initiated in december ocular neovascularization f  anti integrin antibody fab fragment of anti integrin antibody for ocular indications  including age related macular degeneration no further development expected development progress may be affected by potential partnering discussions or commitment of resources to more advanced programs 
acquisition of zenapax rights from roche we recorded a charge to acquired in process research and development totaling approximately million in connection with the amendment to our collaboration agreement with roche in october  pursuant to which we now have exclusive worldwide rights to market  develop  manufacture and sell zenapax daclizumab in all disease indications other than transplantation 
this amount relates to the rights to autoimmune indications for daclizumab that were then being developed and tested in clinical studies  specifically to treat asthma and ulcerative colitis 
significant changes to the acquired in process research and development daclizumab projects since december  are as follows in march  we reported positive results from the initial clinical study of daclizumab in patients with chronic  persistent asthma whose disease is not well controlled with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids 
we currently expect that the next trial of daclizumab to support development in asthma to be a single dose  phase i study in healthy volunteers using pdl manufactured daclizumab administered subcutaneously 
we expect this trial to begin enrollment in the first quarter of this single dose trial is expected to be followed by a multiple dose phase i study 
we anticipate that a subsequent phase iib clinical trial in moderate to severe persistent asthma could begin in the first quarter of in may  we reported results from a phase ii clinical study of daclizumab in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis 
daclizumab did not meet primary or secondary endpoints in the trial  and we do not intend to develop it further for this indication 
assumptions underlying in process research and development charges the values of the acquired in process research and development from both the eos acquisition and the roche arrangement were determined by estimating the related future probability adjusted net cash flows  which were then discounted to present values using a rate of 
this discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital taking into account the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from such projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete each product  the estimated life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
in determining the value of the acquired in process research and development  the assumed commercialization dates used for the potential products ranged from to and to related to the eos acquisition and the roche arrangement  respectively 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with timely completion of development  including the uncertainty and timing of commencing human clinical trials and patient enrollment  as well as uncertainties related to the results of such studies  including interpretation of the data and obtaining fda and other regulatory body approvals 
the nature of the remaining efforts for completion of the acquired in process research and development projects primarily consist of initiating clinical trials and studies  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to determine 
feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical studies might require modifications or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional studies to be performed 
the acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals and the fact that the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting has not been determined 
if these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis  then our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted 
interest and other income  interest expense and impairment loss on investment years ended december annual percent change in thousands interest and other income  interest expense and investment impairment interest and other income  net interest expense impairment loss on investment in  interest and other income  net included interest income of million 
in  interest and other income  net consisted of interest income of million  partially offset by early debt extinguishment charges of approximately million 
interest income decreased by million in when compared to primarily due to lower invested cash and marketable securities balances  and to a lesser extent  declining interest rates on our marketable securities 
interest income decreased by million in when compared to primarily due to declining interest rates on our marketable securities 
interest expense in  net of amounts capitalized  related to our convertible notes issued in  a term loan associated with the purchase our fremont  california facilities  and notes payable assumed in our acquisition of eos in the second quarter of interest expense in  net of amounts capitalized  related to our convertible subordinated notes that were redeemed in november  our notes  a term loan associated with the purchase our fremont  california facilities  and notes payable assumed in our acquisition of eos in the second quarter of interest expense in related to our convertible subordinated notes and a term loan associated with the purchase our fremont  california facilities 
interest expense for decreased slightly compared  due primarily to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in november and increased capitalized interest during the year 
capitalized interest was million and million in and  respectively  primarily in connection with the renovation of our existing manufacturing facilities and the development activities for our future manufacturing facilities 
interest expense for increased slightly compared to the same period in  due to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of the notes in july  including higher amortization of associated debt issuance costs  and the notes payable assumed from the eos acquisition  partially offset by increased capitalized interest 
capitalized interest was million and million in and  respectively  in connection with the renovation of our existing manufacturing facilities and the development activities for our future manufacturing facilities 
we expect that interest expense in will increase from the issuance of our convertible senior notes due february  with a principal amount of million 
in january  we sold the assets of our small molecule group to signature bioscience  inc signature  a privately held drug discovery company  in exchange for  shares of signature convertible preferred stock 
the stock received was recorded at the net book value of the assets sold plus transaction costs incurred  which approximated million 
in conjunction with this transaction  in december  we accrued an additional million payable to signature in connection with cash retention bonuses to designated key employees still employed by signature after one year 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  in exchange for these bonus payments we received in early an additional  shares of signature convertible preferred stock  which was recorded as an increase in the carrying value of the preferred stock 
as of december   we estimated that the value of our investment in signature had declined to  and that the impairment was other then temporary 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in december the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated fair value as determined by our management and our original cost basis in the shares of approximately million 
as of march   we determined that our investment in signature had become fully and permanently impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of  in march to write off the remaining book value of our investment 
income taxes we have recorded a tax provision of approximately  for primarily related to income earned in our foreign operations and foreign withholding tax in connection with a license maintenance fee  compared to  for we do not expect to record any tax provision for federal income taxes during based upon our projected us tax loss for liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity and debt securities  revenue under agreements with third parties and interest income on invested capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted investments in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in our operating activities in was approximately million compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in in  the change in cash used in operating activities as compared to the prior year related primarily to the funding of greater operating expenses partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue resulting from the collaboration agreement signed with roche in september net cash used in our operating activities in was approximately million compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in in  the change in cash used in operating activities as compared to related primarily to the funding of greater operating expenses and increases in other current assets and other assets resulting from the transaction costs associated with the issuance of our notes  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the construction of our new commercial manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
in  net cash used in our investing activities was million  compared to cash used in investing activities in of million 
the change in was primarily the result of the timing of purchases of marketable securities  as well as the purchase of intangible assets with cash in the purchase of intangible assets in primarily related to an amendment to our collaboration agreement with roche  pursuant to which we paid roche million in cash in return for exclusive worldwide rights to market  manufacture and sell daclizumab in all disease indications other than transplantation  resulting in a charge to in process research and development of million and intangible assets of million 
purchases of property and equipment in and were primarily related to the development  construction and validation activities for our manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
in  net cash used in our investing activities was million  compared to cash provided by investing activities in of million 
the change in was primarily the result of purchases of marketable securities associated with the issuance of our million convertible notes  as well as the purchase of intangible assets and increased purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment in were primarily related to the development and construction activities for our manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
in  purchases of land  property and equipment primarily consisted of land and equipment purchases in connection with the renovation of our existing plymouth  minnesota manufacturing facility as well as construction activities for our manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
net cash provided by our financing activities in was million compared to million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the increased levels in was primarily the result of proceeds totaling million in from the issuance of our convertible notes in july  partially offset by the redemption of our convertible notes in november in the aggregate of approximately million 
in february  we issued convertible senior notes due february  with a principal amount of million notes 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all our existing and future indebtedness and may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  beginning on february  at par value 
we plan to use the proceeds from the notes to help fund the acquisition of esp pharma esp pursuant to an agreement signed in january  as amended  as well as the purchase by esp of the retavase product see overview section above 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  including the cash proceeds from the notes  will be sufficient to fund our current and future level of operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  royalties from sales of products by third party licensees  including synagis  herceptin  xolair  raptiva  zenapax  mylotarg  and avastin  our ability to enter into additional collaborative  humanization  patent license and patent rights agreements  interest income  progress of product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of our licensees to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market products licensed under our patents  the continued or additional support by our collaborative partners or other third parties of research and development efforts and clinical trials  investment in existing and new research and development programs  time required to gain regulatory approvals  significant resources we will devote to constructing and qualifying our manufacturing facilities  our ability to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative arrangements  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  successful integration of acquired businesses  including the transition to pdl existing relationships with partners  distributors  third party vendors  manufacturers  and customers of acquired companies  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize our potential products we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders

we received an exclusive  worldwide license to develop antibodies against certain targets identified by exelixis that are involved in cell growth  cell death and proliferation 
exelixis has the right to co fund development of antibodies resulting from the collaboration 
therefore  we recognized the expense of research funding ratably over the periods for which it was performed

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt fas r on july  under fas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of fas r and we expect that the adoption of fas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting fas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under fas off balance sheet arrangements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we hold a million five year convertible note receivable purchased from exelixis  inc in may accounting rules require the conversion feature of some convertible notes to be separated from the debt agreement in which the conversion feature is contained and accounted for as a derivative instrument  and therefore reflected in the note purchaser s financial statements based upon the fair market value of the stock into which the note is convertible 
due in part to the number of shares into which this note receivable would currently convert and the average daily trading volume of exelixis stock  the exelixis note is not currently considered a derivative instrument and  therefore  changes in the market value of exelixis stock are not required to be recorded in our financial statements 
however  a significant increase in the average daily trading volume of exelixis stock  or changes or interpretations in accounting principles could require us to report the value of the exelixis stock in our financial statements 
such a requirement could cause us to include changes in the exelixis stock price on a quarterly basis and would contribute to fluctuation in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
as of december   the aggregate fair values of our long term debt and convertible subordinated notes were approximately million and million  respectively  based on available pricing information 
the long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate of and the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
these obligations are subject to interest rate risk because the fixed interest rates under these obligations may exceed current interest rates 
the following table presents information about our material debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for our debt obligations 
our convertible notes may be converted to common stock prior to the maturity date 
liabilties s thereafter total fair value long term debt  including current portion fixed rate avg 
interest rate convertible subordinated notes fixed rate avg 
interest rate the fair value of the remaining payments under our long term obligations is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  based on our current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
foreign currency risk as we have operations outside of the united states  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate 
to date  our foreign operations have not been significant to our results of operations and financial condition  therefore  our current foreign currency risk is minimal
