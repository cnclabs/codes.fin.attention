the town and country trust  organized in  is a real estate investment trust reit focused on the ownership and operation of multifamily apartment communities in selected markets in the mid atlantic and southeast regions of the u 
s 
at december   the company owned apartment communities with  apartment homes 
the company seeks to acquire additional apartments in certain of its existing markets  and other high barrier to entry markets  particularly in the greater washington  d 
c 
and baltimore metropolitan areas and in florida 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate its portfolio for communities and or submarkets that may no longer match its long term strategy 
in  the company acquired three apartment communities with an average age of years while disposing of five apartment communities with an average age of years 
in  the company exited the charlotte  north carolina market through the strategic disposition of its two apartment communities located there 
during  the company had been unable to find suitable investment opportunities in its preferred markets at acceptable pricing  as the investment climate for multifamily properties has continued to be extremely competitive 
the company continues to aggressively reinvest in its existing portfolio 
renovation projects include modernization of kitchens and bathrooms  new building entrances and windows  new business and fitness centers  and the addition of washers and dryers inside apartment homes 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of real estate assets the company periodically evaluates its apartment communities for potential impairment indicators 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the apartment communities 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the company s portfolio of apartment communities is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
real estate the company capitalizes expenditures made to acquire new assets or to substantially improve the value or extend the useful life of an existing asset 
any expenditure to repair or maintain an existing asset in normal operating condition is expensed as incurred 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
in assessing estimated useful lives  the company makes assumptions based on historical experience acquired from both within and outside the company 
the company accounts for property acquisitions utilizing the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of acquired properties are included in the company s results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the company allocates the purchase price to the acquired tangibles  consisting of land  building and improvements  and  if material  to identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of above below market leases and at market leases in place based on their fair values 
revenue recognition revenue from rental property is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the lease 
leases are generally for terms of one year or less 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain are measured against the various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and the company s continuing involvement  if any  associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  the company defers gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
discontinued operations sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been sold since january   or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements in both current and prior periods presented 
the community specific components of net income that are presented as discontinued operations include net operating income  depreciation expense  minority interest and interest expense 
in addition  the net gain or loss including any impairment charge on the disposition of communities held for sale is presented as discontinued operations 
a change in presentation for discontinued operations does not have any impact on the company s financial conditions or results of operations 
real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell  and are presented separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
hedge accounting the company carries all derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities on its balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value of these instruments  which qualify as cash flow hedges  are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
any ineffective portion of the change in value is recorded to current period earnings 
furthermore  should any change in management strategy  or other circumstance  cause an existing highly effective hedge to become entirely ineffective  the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be required to be immediately reclassified from the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet to the income statement 
new accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement no 
r 
statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using an option pricing model adjusted for any unique characteristics of a particular instrument 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r during the third quarter the adoption of this new standard will not have a material effect on the financial position or financial results of the company 
results of operations the company s results include the results of both continuing and discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations reflects the results of operations of seven apartment communities  apartment homes that were sold since the beginning of the company s results from continuing operations consist of both same store results and results of new acquisitions 
same store results reflect results from  apartment homes owned and operated throughout both and results from new acquisitions include results from three communities apartment homes acquired in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for was  or per diluted share  a decrease of  from  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  included in net income is an  gain resulting from the sale of five communities in included in net income for and is  and  respectively  of impairment charges recorded on properties that were sold during net income for also includes a separation charge of  related to the departure of two senior executives consisting primarily of cash payments that will be paid during and during  the company revised the estimated useful lives of certain depreciable assets  principally carpet  to more closely approximate their current economic lives based upon the company s capital improvement and renovation plans 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in additional depreciation expense of  continuing operations same store communities operating results for the same store communities are set forth in the table below in thousands year ended december  change rental income    operating expenses    net operating income    a reconciliation between net income and same store net operating income is as follows in thousands year ended december  same store net operating income   deduct add real estate depreciation   interest expense   general and administrative   other depreciation and amortization  separation expense  loss income from discontinued operations  net operating income from acquisitions   income allocated to minority interest  net income   the company uses net operating income noi to measure the operating results of its communities and to compare the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets 
the company defines noi as property rental income less property operating expenses and does not include general and administrative expenses  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  discontinued operations  or gains losses on sales of properties 
accordingly  this performance measure is not intended as a replacement for net income determined in accordance with us gaap 
noi is widely used by management and investors in the real estate industry in connection with the valuation of income producing real estate and as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
noi measures presented by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is computed as net income loss computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains and losses from sales and involuntary conversions of operating properties  plus real estate depreciation 
this computation of ffo is consistent with the formal definition promulgated by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
the reconciliation of ffo to net income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with us gaap  is included in the table below 
management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing the comparative operating performance of the trust between periods or as compared to other companies  without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time and which can vary among owners of similar assets based upon historical cost and useful life estimates 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance nor does it represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with us gaap and  therefore  it should not be considered indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
while the nareit definition of ffo does not specifically address involuntary conversions of operating properties  management believes that such conversions are  in substance  sales of property 
since the nareit definition of ffo excludes gains and losses on property sales  the reported gain on involuntary conversion has  likewise  been excluded from ffo 
a reconciliation between net income and ffo is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income    income allocated to minority interest   gain on involuntary conversion gain on sales of operating properties  real estate depreciation    funds from operations     funds from operations for and include a  and a  respectively  impairment charge on the charlotte properties sold during funds from operations for includes a  charge for separation expense relating to the departure of two senior officers

in connection with the company s improvement program discussed below  the company currently has contracts pending that aggregate  for work to be performed over the next one to three years 
however  these contracts contain certain provisions to allow for termination without significant penalties 
liquidity and capital resources a summary of the company s cash flow activities is as follows in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    operating activities provided unrestricted cash for of  compared to  for  and  for the decrease in operating cash flow is primarily the result of increased interest expense and the reduction of income attributable to the portfolio changes 
net cash flow used for capital expenditures has continued to increase over the past few years related to the company s capital improvement program as discussed below 
the company expects to expand this program to additional properties in the foreseeable future 
the proceeds from the sale of the company s charlotte properties  along with the issuance of additional common shares  were used to fund the capital expenditure program and pay down debt 
although the trustees consider the appropriateness of the dividend level on a quarterly basis  the company does not anticipate any change in its dividend policy at this time 
the company makes capital improvements to certain of its properties 
these capital improvements include expenditures that increase the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
normal  recurring capital expenditures generally relate to items having economic lives of years or less and include the replacement of appliances  carpeting and tile plus other routine capital expenditures such as landscaping  parking lot sealing and striping  hvac equipment and various interior and exterior building improvements 
the company also makes certain expenditures that are considered to be non recurring or revenue enhancing in nature and generally relate either to i items having economic lives of more than years or ii renovation projects such as the modernization of kitchen and bathrooms  new building entrances and windows  new business and fitness centers  and the addition of new appliances such as washers and dryers 
in conjunction with certain of these renovation projects  the company enters into commitments to purchase goods and services with vendors performing the work

a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates in over the rates in effect during would result in an increase of interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before discontinued operations and minority interest of approximately  this estimate incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures that could arise after that date 
the company uses interest rate protection agreements to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates as required by its secured credit facility 
the company maintains two interest rate protection agreements for million and million  capping the company s exposure to libor at and  respectively  through march in addition  the company executed two million floating to fixed interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on million of floating rate debt under the secured credit facility at a blended rate of approximately 
the company simultaneously sold two million interest rate caps  capping the company s exposure to libor at 
these interest rate protection agreements hedge interest payments consistent with the company s risk management objective and strategy to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to increases in libor 
debt agreements typically contain representations and financial or other covenants that must be adhered to in order for a borrower to avoid default on the agreement 
the company monitors its compliance with the covenants set forth in its debt agreements and does not believe that it will breach any of them in the ordinary course of business 
a breach of a material covenant would normally result in the inability of the company to maintain funds available until such breach is remedied or would allow the lender to require the company to repay the debt obligation 
the company has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec that provides for the issuance of up to million in securities 
the company believes that it is prudent to maintain shelf registration capacity in order to facilitate future capital raising activities 
in february  the company sold  of its common shares pursuant to its shelf registration in a private sale at a negotiated price of per share 
after the sale  approximately million in securities remains available under the shelf registration statement 
the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale  along with the proceeds of the debt offering in august  were used to pay down floating rate debt 
management believes that the company has and will have access to the capital resources necessary to adequately fund its business 
at december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents and million available under its working capital line of credit 
the company also had million in unused capacity on its secured credit facility which it intends to use primarily to fund acquisitions as well as its on going capital improvements program 
in addition  another million is available for acquisitions on its bank line of credit 
the company expects that adequate cash will be available to fund its operating and administrative expenses  normal capital expenditures  debt service obligations and payments of dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company believes that the direct effects of inflation upon its operations are immaterial 
substantially all of its apartment unit leases are for a term of one year or less  which enables the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or reletting of apartment units 
such short term leases minimize the risk of the adverse effects of inflation  however  as a general rule  such leases permit tenants to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty
