item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive overview the company is a specialty retailer of private label  sophisticated  casual to dressy clothing  intimates  complementary accessories  and other non clothing gift items operating under the chico s  wh bm and soma by chico s brand names 
chico s  which began operations in  focuses on women who are years old and up with moderate and higher income levels 
the styling is relaxed  figure flattering and designed for easy care 
wh bm  which the company acquired in september  targets middle to upper income youthful women who are years old and up 
the styling is contemporary  feminine and unique  assorted primarily in the classic and timeless colors of white and black and related shades 
soma by chico s was initially launched in august this concept offers foundation products in intimate apparel  sleepwear  bodywear and active wear that is aimed at the chico s target customer  but with focus and styling that is expected to ultimately appeal to a broader customer base 
the company earns revenues and generates cash through the sale of merchandise in its retail stores  to its chico s franchisees  and through its call center  which handles sales related to the chico s catalog and online operations 
since the company opened its first chico s store in principally selling folk art  its retail store system  now selling principally women s apparel  has grown to stores as of march   of which are company owned chico s stores  are chico s franchised stores  are wh bm stores and are soma by chico s stores 
during fiscal  the company completed the closing conversion process for its remaining pazo stores by converting five stores to the wh bm concept and three stores to the soma by chico s concept while closing the remaining pazo store 
from january  through january   the company opened new company owned stores  acquired one store from a franchisee  and one franchisee opened four new franchised stores 
of the new company owned stores  were opened in fiscal net of the former pazo stores that were closed and converted into wh bm stores and soma by chico s stores  were opened in fiscal  were opened in fiscal  were opened in fiscal and were opened in fiscal during this same time period  the company closed company owned stores and no franchised stores were closed 
the company expects to open between and net new stores during fiscal year of this total  approximately are expected to be chico s stores  approximately are expected to be wh bm stores and up to are expected to be soma by chico s stores 
in addition  the company is evaluating certain existing company owned store locations  including stores with leases coming up for renewal  and is considering the possibility of closing between and existing company owned stores in fiscal in september  the company acquired the white house  inc  and its concept  wh bm  for approximately million  of which approximately million consisted of cash consideration net of cash acquired and the balance consisted of the company s common stock 
the white house  inc was a privately held retailer  which owned stores in states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  on the closing date of the acquisition 
the company remains positive about the acquisition and believes that the acquisition will strengthen its position in the specialty retail market and will contribute to the company s overall growth strategy 
the primary factors which historically have influenced the company s profitability and success have been its growth in number of stores  its growth in comparable store sales  and its increased operating margin arising out of improved gross profit margin and leverage of operating costs 
in the last five years the company has grown from stores as of january  to stores as of january   which includes the 
table of contents significant store growth resulting from the acquisition of wh bm in fiscal the company continues to expand its presence through the opening of new stores  the development of new opportunities such as soma by chico s and through the extension of its merchandise line 
the company anticipates that its rate of growth measured by overall growth in sales  growth in comparable store sales  and other factors can be expected to decrease from the plus rate of overall sales growth experienced in prior years  largely reflecting the company s significantly increased size  its net square footage growth goal and the expectation that its same store sales increases will moderate 
nevertheless  even at a reduced growth rate  the company expects to continue its ability to generate the necessary cash flow to fund its expansion and to take advantage of new opportunities 
the company has no long term debt and foresees no current need to incur long term debt to support its continued growth 
factors that will be critical to determining the company s future success include  among others  managing the overall growth strategy  including the ability to open and operate stores effectively  maximizing efficiencies in the merchandising  product development and sourcing processes  maintaining high standards for customer service and assistance  maintaining the newness  fit and comfort in its merchandise offerings  customer acceptance of new store concepts  and generating cash to fund the company s expansion needs 
in order to monitor the company s success  the company s senior management monitors certain key performance indicators  including comparable same store sales growth in fiscal  the company s comparable store sales growth sales from stores open for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market was 
this increase represents the eighth consecutive year in which the company has experienced double digit comparable store sales growth 
the company believes that comparable store sales growth  although not necessarily double digit growth  is a critical success factor and a positive indication of the company s ability to manage its expansion and its ability to open and operate stores effectively 
maintaining comparable same store sales growth over an extended period of time into the future can be impacted by saturation  customer receptiveness to new product offerings and price elasticity  among other factors 
in october  the acquired wh bm stores entered into the comparable store base 
as a result  the ability of the company to maintain strong comparable same store sales increases within the wh bm stores will be important to the ability of the company to continue its comparable same store sales growth 
positive operating cash flow in fiscal  the company generated million of cash flow from operations compared with million in fiscal  which represents an increase of 
reflected in the million of cash flow from operations are the effects of lease accounting changes completed by the company in fiscal that had the effect of increasing reported cash flows from operations by million 
approximately of the increase in operating cash flow was attributable to the increase in the tax benefit from an unusual volume of stock option exercises  and the remaining cash flow increase represented a growth of over 
the company believes a key strength of its business is the historical ability to consistently generate cash 
strong cash flow generation is critical to the future success of the company  not only to support the general operating needs of the company  but also to fund capital expenditures related to new store openings  relocations  expansions and remodels  to fund additional infrastructure costs associated with the distribution center and headquarters  to continue funding implementation of state of the art information systems and to fund any potential strategic acquisitions 
cash flow can be negatively impacted by a slow down in sales  higher costs of goods sold as a percentage of sales and increased selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
see further discussion of the company s cash flows in the liquidity and capital resources section 
loyalty clubs management believes that a significant indicator of the company s success with its personalized customer service training programs and the success of its marketing initiatives is the growth of the chico s loyalty program  the passport club 
the passport club features discounts and other special promotions for its members 
preliminary members may join the passport club at no cost and upon spending  customers automatically become permanent members and are entitled to a lifetime discount and other benefits 
during fiscal  the company added  permanent 
table of contents passport club members and  preliminary passport club members 
in fiscal  permanent passport club members accounted for approximately of overall sales  about the same as in fiscal the company believes that the growth of its passport club indicates that the company is still generating strong interest from new customers  many of whom tend to become long term loyal customers  due in large part to the company s commitment to personalized customer service and constant newness of product 
the company introduced a new frequent shopper program at its wh bm stores during october called the black book 
the black book loyalty program is similar to the passport club in all key respects except that members become permanent upon spending since the black book was introduced in october and as of january   wh bm has added over  permanent members and over  preliminary members 
since being launched  the permanent black book members have accounted for of overall sales  while preliminary members have accounted for of overall sales 
quality and merit of merchandise offerings to monitor and maintain the acceptance of its merchandise offerings  the company monitors sell through levels  inventory turns  gross margins and markdown rates on a classification and style level 
although the company does not disclose these statistics for competitive reasons  this analysis helps identify comfort  fit and newness issues at an early date and helps the company plan future product development and buying 
in fiscal year  the company reported net sales  operating income and net income of billion  million and million  respectively  up  and  from the prior fiscal year 
the company s gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases in operating income and net income benefited significantly from the leverage associated with the company s fiscal comparable store sales increase of 
sales and profitability trends are further discussed in the results of operations section 
results of operations net sales the following table shows net sales by company owned stores  net sales by catalog and internet and net sales to franchisees in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for the fiscal years ended january  fiscal or current period  january  fiscal or prior period and february  fiscal dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales by chico s soma stores net sales by wh bm stores net sales by catalog and internet net sales to franchisees net sales 
table of contents net sales by company owned stores increased over the past three years  both in the aggregate and separately by brand  primarily due to new store openings  the acquisition of the white house  inc on september   as well as from double digit increases in the company s comparable store net sales including stores within the comparable store base that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market 
fiscal includes full months of net sales for wh bm stores whereas fiscal only includes approximately months of net sales for wh bm running from the date of the acquisition 
a summary of the factors impacting year over year sales increases is provided in the table below dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales increases comparable same store sales new store sales number of new company owned stores opened  net stores acquired in the wh bm acquisition are not counted as new company owned stores opened  and such stores are also not included in the computation of comparable same store sales until october the comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in the number of transactions compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from an increase of in the chico s average unit retail price which is a financial indicator  the percentage change of which is believed by management to represent a reasonable approximation of the percentage change in company store net sales attributable to price changes 
the comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in the number of transactions compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from an increase of in the chico s average unit retail price 
wh bm stores were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in october  which was full months after the acquisition date of september  for fiscal  wh bm sales prior to october are included in new store sales 
sales from wh bm stores since the date of acquisition on september  and through the end of fiscal were included in new store sales for fiscal and no such sales were included in fiscal comparable store sales 
sales from the company s discontinued pazo store concept in fiscal and have been included in the new store sales for the applicable periods and no such sales are included in comparable store sales 
sales from the soma by chico s store concept in fiscal are included in new store sales and are not included in comparable store sales because no soma stores have yet been open a full months 
net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal which only included chico s and soma merchandise increased by million  or  compared to net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal it is believed that the increase was principally attributable to the increased circulation of catalog mailings and additional television spots in the current year versus the prior period 
net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal which only included chico s merchandise increased by million  or  compared to net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal it is believed that the increase was principally attributable to the increased page count and number of catalog mailings and additional television spots in the current year versus the prior period 
cost of goods sold gross profit the following table shows cost of goods sold and gross profit in dollars and the related gross profit percentages for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit percentage 
table of contents the increase in the gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal was positively impacted by improved margins at the chico s frontline stores mainly due to improved initial merchandise markups which were offset  to a lesser degree  by increased markdowns as a percent of net sales and  to a lesser extent  from significantly improved margins at the company s outlet stores 
also  but to a lesser degree  the gross profit percentage was positively impacted by operating efficiencies associated with the company s new distribution center the costs of which are included in the company s cost of goods sold 
the gross profit percentage was adversely impacted by wh bm sales  which carried a lower gross profit percentage than sales at chico s frontline stores wh bm merchandise margins were approximately percentage points lower than the merchandise margins at chico s and an increase in product development costs  as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to an investment in the wh bm merchandise and product development teams and costs associated with the launch of the soma by chico s brand in the third quarter of fiscal to a lesser extent  the gross profit percentage was adversely impacted by increased inventory clearance costs 
the increase in the gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal primarily resulted from operating efficiencies related to the company s new distribution center which costs are included in the company s cost of goods sold 
to a lesser extent  the improvement in the gross profit percentage was from improved margins at the chico s frontline and outlet stores which improvement resulted from improved initial merchandise markups on new products in the current period versus the prior period offset  in part  by increased markdowns in the current period as a percent of net sales and  to an even lesser degree  from decreased inventory and related shrinkage costs 
these improvements in the gross profit percentage were also offset  in part  by wh bm and pazo sales  which in fiscal carried a lower gross profit percentage than the company as a whole 
general  administrative and store operating expenses the following table shows general  administrative and store operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses percentage of total net sales the increase in general  administrative and store operating expenses was  for the most part  the result of increases in the company s store operating expenses  including associate compensation  occupancy and other costs associated with additional store openings including those costs associated with the wh bm stores added by virtue of the acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser degree  an increase in marketing expenses and other general corporate infrastructure costs to support the company s rapid growth 
the increase in general  administrative and store operating expenses was also impacted by the company s decision  in connection with a review of its accounting practices relating to leasing transactions  to record a one time  non cash adjustment related to the timing of rent expense for store locations 
previously  the company followed a practice prevalent across the retailing industry  in which it recognized the straight line rent expense for leases beginning generally on the earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date  which had the effect of excluding the build out period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expensed rent 
the company now records rent expense when it takes possession of a store  which occurs before the commencement of the lease term or approximately days prior to the opening of the store 
this adjustment resulted in a one time  cumulative  non cash increase to rent expense of approximately million pre tax 
of the million pre tax expense recorded in fiscal  million was attributable to the current year and million pre tax  was related to prior fiscal years 
furthermore  the company revised the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances from landlords of properties leased by the company for its stores 
for fiscal and for future fiscal years  construction allowances will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense  rather than being amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense  which was the approach followed in prior fiscal years 
for fiscal  the impact of amortizing construction allowances as a reduction of rent expense rather than as a reduction of 
table of contents depreciation expense resulted in a decrease to rent expense of approximately million 
the net impact of these two lease accounting adjustments was immaterial to general  administrative and store operating expenses in total and as a percentage of total net sales 
general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved basis points over the prior period primarily because there was million of store closing costs associated with the conclusion of the pazo test concept included in fiscal with no comparable expense in fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted during fiscal by decreases in chico s store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal due primarily to leverage improvements in store personnel and occupancy costs associated with the company s current period comparable store sales increase of 
this improvement was offset to a lesser extent by costs associated with the wh bm store operating expenses  which tend to run higher than chico s stores operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also negatively impacted  but to an even lesser degree  by increased marketing costs as a percentage of net sales  costs related to the interim continuation of the wh bm corporate headquarters and related functions  and costs associated with the company s sarbanes oxley initiatives 
general  administrative and store operating expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but remained constant as a percent of total net sales 
the increase in absolute dollars was  for the most part  the result of increases in chico s store operating expenses  including associate compensation  occupancy and other costs associated with additional store openings  the acquisition of the wh bm stores and  to a lesser degree  an increase in marketing expenses and other general corporate infrastructure costs to support the company s rapid growth 
general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales experienced a decrease compared to fiscal due to decreases in chico s store associate compensation and store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and by leverage associated with the company s fiscal comparable store sales increase of 
however  these decreases were offset by the effect of the pazo concept stores  including approximately million of store closing costs associated with the conclusion of the pazo concept including a million fixed asset impairment charge  and wh bm stores  which operate with considerably higher store operating expenses as a percent of net sales compared to chico s 
depreciation and amortization the following table shows depreciation and amortization in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal depreciation and amortization percentage of total net sales the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal was  for the most part  due to capital expenditures related to new  remodeled and expanded stores 
depreciation and amortization expense  in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales  was also impacted by the company s revision to the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances from landlords of properties leased by the company for its stores  as discussed above 
the impact of this revision was to increase depreciation expense in fiscal by approximately million with an offsetting decrease in rent expense of million 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal was  for the most part  due to capital expenditures related to new  remodeled and expanded stores 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal was comparable to the prior year 
provision for income taxes during fiscal  the company completed a review of the taxability of its operations in various state taxing jurisdictions and adjusted its income tax provision for fiscal resulting in an effective tax rate of 
table of contents approximately  which remains comparable to the effective tax rate in each of fiscal and fiscal the company expects that its effective tax rate in future years will approximate 
net income the following table shows net income in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net income percentage of total net sales comparable company store net sales comparable company store net sales increased by in the weeks ended january  when compared to the comparable prior period 
comparable company store net sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales of currently open company owned stores that have been operated as a company store for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market area approximately five miles 
the comparable store percentage reported above includes stores that were expanded or relocated within the last two fiscal years by an average of net selling square feet 
if the stores that were expanded and relocated had been excluded from the comparable company owned store base  the increase in comparable company owned store net sales would have been for fiscal versus as reported 
the company does not consider the effect to be material to the overall comparable store sales results and believes the inclusion of expanded stores in the comparable store net sales to be an acceptable practice  consistent with the practice followed by the company in prior periods and by some other retailers 
wh bm stores acquired in the white house  inc acquisition were included in the comparable store sales calculation for the first time beginning in october and wh bm stores opened since the acquisition are treated the same as all other company owned stores 
the company believes that the increase in comparable company store net sales in the current fiscal year resulted from the continuing effort to focus the company s product development  merchandise planning  buying and marketing departments on the company s target customers 
the company also believes that the look  fit and pricing policy of the company s product was in line with the needs of the company s target customers 
in addition  the company believes that the increase in comparable store sales was also fueled by a coordinated marketing plan  which includes national and regional television advertising  national magazine advertising  increased direct mailings of catalogs  a larger database of existing customers for such mailings and the success of the company s frequent shopper clubs 
to a lesser degree  the company believes the increase was due to continued store level training efforts associated with ongoing training programs and the company s overall ability to maintain its high standards for customer service and assistance 
the following table sets forth for each of the quarters of the previous five fiscal years  the percentage change in comparable store net sales at company owned stores from the comparable period in the prior fiscal year fiscal year ended full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary ongoing capital requirements are for funding capital expenditures for new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores and increased merchandise inventories  for expansion of headquarters and other central support facilities and for continued improvement in information technology tools 
the company anticipates that its current headquarters facility will be insufficient to meet its needs by the end of fiscal accordingly  the company is engaged in strategic long term planning to address its space requirements for the future 
the company s options include expanding its current headquarters facility  building a new headquarters at a different location  or moving into an existing building in a different location 
in order to help with immediate space needs  the company has leased off site space for its call center and will likely lease additional off site space to house discrete business units until its long term solution is in place 
also  to a lesser degree  during fiscal  the company experienced the need for working capital to address the launching of its new intimate apparel concept  soma by chico s  whose stores began opening during the third quarter of fiscal the following table shows the company s capital resources at the end of fiscal year and amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital working capital increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the company s ability to generate significant cash from operating activities in large part due to the company s strong comparable store sales  which cash was substantially more than necessary to satisfy the company s investment in capital expenditures 
the significant components of the company s working capital are cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and inventories  reduced by accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
based on past performance and current expectations  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures see new store openings and headquarters expansion discussed below  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with the company s operations through at least the next months 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
as part of its review of accounting practices related to lease transactions  beginning in fiscal  the company has included construction allowances received from landlords as cash provided by operating activities whereas in prior years  these allowances were recorded as a reduction of capital expenditures  within cash flows from investing activities 
the impact to net cash provided by operating activities was an increase of million in fiscal  provided however  that this change had no impact on overall cash flow 
the cash provided by operating activities for both periods was due to the company s net income adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital such as depreciation and amortization expense  normal fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid and other current assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
significant adjustments to net income for fiscal included a non cash tax benefit of million related to the exercise of employee stock options 

table of contents significant adjustments to net income for fiscal included a non cash tax benefit of million related to the exercise of employee stock options  and a non cash charge of million associated with the impairment of assets related to the pazo store closings 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was significantly impacted in fiscal by the acquisition of the white house  inc the cash paid for the acquisition was approximately million net of cash acquired of million 
the company s investment in capital expenditures during fiscal primarily related to the planning and opening of new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s  wh bm  and soma by chico s stores million  distribution center infrastructure costs million  installation costs associated with new software packages and systems integration of the wh bm million and other miscellaneous capital expenditures million 
capital expenditures increased by million from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of more new store openings in fiscal when compared to fiscal  the launch of the soma by chico s concept in the third quarter of fiscal and the company s revision to the manner in which construction allowances received from landlords are presented 
the impact of the construction allowance change was to increase purchases of property and equipment by million in fiscal the company invested million  net  in marketable securities in the current year 
in the prior year  the company invested million in marketable securities 
the substantially lower investment in net marketable securities in fiscal was  for the most part  caused by the company s need to liquidate a significant portion of its marketable securities in fiscal to fund the acquisition of the white house  inc in august  the company also paid million to acquire the net assets of a franchise store 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company received proceeds in both fiscal and from the issuance of common stock related to current and former employee option exercises and employee participation in its employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  the company satisfied the remaining balances due on capital leases assumed as a result of the white house  inc acquisition totaling million 
in september  the company s board of directors approved the repurchase  over a twelve month period ending in september  of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during fiscal in connection with this stock repurchase program  at a total cost of approximately million 
during fiscal  twenty two of the company s thirty three officers or former officers and three of its five independent directors exercised an aggregate of  stock options at prices ranging from to and several employees and former employees exercised an aggregate of  options at prices ranging from to 
also  during this period  the company sold  and  shares of common stock during the march and september offering periods under its employee stock purchase plan at prices of and  respectively 
the proceeds from these issuances of stock  exclusive of the tax benefit realized by the company  amounted to approximately million 
new store openings and headquarters expansion the company plans to open between and net new company owned stores which includes approximately net new chico s stores  approximately net new wh bm stores and up to new soma by chico s stores in fiscal the company believes that the liquidity needed for its planned new store growth including continued investments associated with the recent launch of its new concept  soma by 
table of contents chico s  continuing remodel expansion program  continued installation and upgrading of new and existing software packages  and maintenance of proper inventory levels associated with this growth will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations and its existing strong cash and marketable securities balances 
the company anticipates that its current headquarters facility will be insufficient to meet its needs by the end of fiscal accordingly  the company is engaged in strategic long term planning to address its space requirements for the future 
the company s options include expanding its current headquarters facility  building a new headquarters at a different location  or moving into an existing building in a different location 
in order to help with immediate space needs  the company has leased off site space for its call center and will likely lease additional off site space to house discrete business units until its long term solution is in place 
the company further believes that this liquidity will be sufficient  based on the above  to fund anticipated capital needs over the near term 
given the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in its bank credit facilities  the company does not believe that it would need to seek other sources of financing to conduct its operations or pursue its expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if the company were to increase the number of new company owned stores planned to be opened  expanded or relocated in future periods or increase the size of any new or expanded headquarters facility from what is currently anticipated 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at january  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt short term borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total as of january   the company s contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases and non cancelable purchase commitments 
amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consist of million of letters of credit outstanding 
in september  the company entered into a replacement unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  expanding the maximum available commitment from million to million  extending the maturity to june and increasing the letter of credit sublimit of the facility from million to million 
the credit facility provides for automatic renewal for successive one year periods beginning after june  subject to the right of either party to terminate on each renewal date upon giving proper notice 
the company intends to allow the credit facility to renew through june and also expects the bank to allow the credit facility to renew through june at january  and january   the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  of the type which certain other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer product returns  inventories  income taxes  insurance reserves  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company identifies potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with the company s overall growth rate 
excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory agings  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in the fashion industry 
the company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
inventory shrinkage the company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventories between physical inventory counts by applying historical chain wide average shrinkage experience rates to the related periods sales volume 
the historical rates are updated on a regular basis to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
sales returns the company s policy is to honor customer returns at all times 
returns after days of the original purchase  or returns without the original receipt  qualify for store credit only 
the company will  in certain circumstances  offer full customer refunds either after days or without a receipt 
the company estimates its reserve for likely customer returns based on the average refund experience in relation to sales for the related period 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of the company s reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets  specifically trademarks  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  medical and general liability claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using insurance industry benchmarks and historical experience 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately accrue for estimated losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee and director stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of sfas r are effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the company expects to adopt sfas r on july   the beginning of the company s third fiscal quarter  using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted after july  and all share based payments granted prior to july  that remain unvested as of such date 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments under apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee or director stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations as well as on the comparability of the results of operations for the next several years  although it will have no impact on its overall financial position 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot reasonably be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption  again impacting the comparability of these financial measures for the next several years 
although the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees and directors exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
seasonality and inflation although the operations of the company are influenced by general economic conditions  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the current or prior periods
