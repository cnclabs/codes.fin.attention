item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors 
the company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand 
the company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to the reserve based on the current business climate 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability  obsolescence  historical experience and current business conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  the company may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title  which generally occurs at the time of shipment 
revenue from the company s sales to domestic distributors is generally recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
as a result  the company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise 
the company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms 
the income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer 
the company s sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
the company has reserves to cover expected product returns 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations  the company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns 
generally  changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  such as the tax benefit for export sales  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if the company determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  it will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary 
on the other hand  the company will record an additional charge to its provision for taxes in the period in which it determines that the recorded tax liability is less than it expects the ultimate assessment to be

the million increase in net revenues is primarily due to a million increase in product sales  largely due to an increase in unit volume for the twelve month period 
demand increased for the company s products in each of its major end markets  particularly in the industrial  communication and high end consumer markets 
the average selling price for the twelve months ended july  was relatively unchanged at per unit as compared to per unit in fiscal in addition to product sales  the company entered into a long term royalty agreement during the third quarter of fiscal that accounted for million of net revenues for the year 
the million represents past royalties under terms of the settlement and license agreement with the other company 
the company expects to earn future royalties  which are dependent on sales of licensed products by the other company  quarterly from july through june such ongoing quarterly royalty revenue is not expected to be material to each individual quarter s net revenues 
geographically  international net revenues were million or of net revenues for the twelve months ended july   an increase of million as compared to international net revenues of million or of net revenues for the same period in fiscal internationally  sales to rest of the world row  which is primarily asia excluding japan  represented million or of net revenues  while sales to europe and japan were million or of net revenues and million or of net revenues  respectively

net revenues for the twelve months ended june  were million  an increase of million or over net revenues of million for the same period of the previous fiscal year 
the increase in net revenues for the twelve month period was due to a significant increase in unit volume as demand increased for the company s products in each of its major end markets  particularly in the industrial and communication markets 
this increase in unit volume was enhanced by significant growth in sales of smaller packaged products that go into a wide variety of hand held products such as cellular phones and mp players 
the significant increase in unit volume was offset partially by a reduction in average selling price  which decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily as a result of the change in sales mix towards smaller packages which carry lower average selling prices

roughly  every five years the company has a week rather than a week fiscal year 
fiscal is a week year with the additional week falling in the three month period ending january  for the twelve months ended july   the extra week had a minimal effect on net revenues 
the extra week resulted in slightly higher compensation costs in the research and development and selling  general and administrative lines of the income statement 
the increase in compensation costs for cost of goods sold was largely offset by lower per unit manufacturing costs resulting from an extra week of production volume 
the company received a benefit from the extra week in interest income because it earned an extra week of interest income from its cash investment balance 
gross profit for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million or over gross profit of million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to of net revenues in fiscal as compared to of net revenues in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across higher net revenues

the decrease in average selling price referred to above did not have a commensurate effect on gross margin 
most of the reduction in average selling price was due to a change in product mix as the company has had increased sales of products with smaller die and package types  which have a smaller average selling price  but also lower costs 
research and development r d expense for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million or over r d expense of million in fiscal the increase in r d was primarily due to a million increase in compensation costs

factors affecting future operating results except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this annual report on form k  including the statements in the following paragraphs  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors  among others  as the timing  volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter  timely ramp up of new facilities  the timely introduction of new processes and products  general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in risks and competition located in the business section of this annual report on form k 
fiscal was a good year for the company  net revenues and net income grew and  respectively  over fiscal for the first time in the company s history net revenues reached billon  which included a million royalty 
the royalty revenue was a significant event for the company since it confirms the strength of its intellectual property 
going forward it continues to be a challenging environment to forecast upcoming results 
the june quarter book to bill ratio was slightly less than one  which therefore lowered backlog 
consequently  the september quarter will require a modestly higher percentage of turns business  which is orders that must be booked and shipped in the same period 
the company expects that bookings will increase in the september quarter 
the company s september quarter usually begins to show strength in its consumer oriented business although the industrial and communication business is generally slower for the company 
macro economic trends continue to improve and the september quarter has started strong  with july being the strongest four week booking month that the company has had in over a year 
given the above data points and other factors  the company expects that sales for the september quarter will be similar to the quarter just completed 
the company will begin expensing stock options in the september quarter  which will have an adverse impact on earnings 
the company estimates that total stock based compensation will impact net income by approximately or roughly cents a share for the september quarter 
estimates of future performance are uncertain  and past performance of the company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the company  its competitors  the semiconductor industry and the overall economy 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion  cyclical market patterns  periodic oversupply conditions  occasional shortages of materials  capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
furthermore  new product introductions and patent protection of existing products  as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the company  are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability 
the company s headquarters and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california  consequently  the company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although the company believes that it has the product lines  manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations  sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors 
additionally  the company s common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community 
furthermore  stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
liquidity and capital resources at july   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled billion and working capital was billion 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million and distributed million in dividends 
after taking into consideration the cash used for these purchases and dividend payments  the company generated additional cash and short term investments of million 
the company s accounts receivable balance increased million from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the increase is due to higher sales and higher day sales outstanding dso which increased from a historical low of days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal to a more representative days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal dso of days was unusually low last year due to unusually high collections at the end of the period 
fourth quarter collections in were million higher than shipments 
the company s accrued payroll and related benefits balance increased million from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the increase is primarily due to increases in the company s profit sharing accrual 
the company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters 
during fiscal  the company generated million of cash from operating activities and million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans 
during fiscal  significant cash expenditures included repurchasing million of common stock  payments of million in cash dividends to stockholders  representing per share per quarter for the first and second quarters and per share per quarter for the third and fourth quarters  million for the purchase of capital assets and net purchases of short term investments of million 
in july  the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share to be paid during the september quarter of fiscal the payment of future dividends will be based on quarterly financial performance 
the company has no debt and has historically satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations 
given its strong financial condition and performance  the company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future 
as of july   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
at the end of fiscal the company entered into a purchase agreement of approximately million for two buildings it currently leases 
the agreement is contingent upon the owner selling a third building that the company currently leases 
the effect of the agreement will not be significant to the company s overall results of operation or financial position 
the company did not have any other significant contractual obligation outside of operating leases as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements on this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
the company s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the company 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
based upon the weighted average duration of the company s investments at july   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the company s investments totaling approximately million 
however  because the company s debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized by the company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
these investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the company generally holds securities until maturity 
the company s sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars  accordingly  the company s sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on the results of operations
