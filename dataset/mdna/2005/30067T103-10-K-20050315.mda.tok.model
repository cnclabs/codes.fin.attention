the company s current range of products include laser marking and engraving systems  laser micro machining systems  co lasers  optical scanners  high power solid state cw and q switched lasers  ultrafast lasers  high energy solid state pulsed lasers  precision optical components and light and color measurement instruments 
the laser and electro optical industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological developments 
our strength and success is dependent upon us developing and delivering successful  timely and cost effective solutions to our customers 
the company believes  for it to maintain its performance  it must continue to increase its operational efficiencies  improve and refine its existing products  expand its product offerings and develop new applications for its technology 
the company s strategy is to grow internally and through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
historically the company has successfully integrated acquired companies into its existing operations 
details on our operations are discussed in our md a 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that the following four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  the company receives a customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and product shipment terms are fob shipping point 
the company s revenues are generated from product sales  including product upgrades and replacement part sales  maintenance agreements  and services 
the company s product lines principally consist of laser based systems and electro optical components used in a wide range of applications by different types of end users and are often used as sub assemblies required for end products manufactured by the customer 
revenue relating to these products is recognized upon transfer of title to the customer  which is generally the shipment date  assuming the other criteria of sab are met 
with respect to maintenance agreements  revenue is recognized and customers are generally billed on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the agreement 
when a customer pays an annual maintenance fee  it is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
for services rendered  customers are billed and revenues are recognized as the related services are performed 
when a sales arrangement involves multiple elements  such as the sale of products that require installation  training or other services  the company records deferred revenue for the fair value of the undelivered element and recognizes the revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for that element is met 
fair value is established for an element based on the price when the element is sold separately 
the company manufactures one product called a photomask defect repair system drs that is a laser based system for use in semiconductor photomask repair 
the drs provides a means to repair defects on the complex photomasks used to produce integrated circuits 
these are very large  highly complex machines  customized for each customer and ranging in price from million to million per unit based upon the most recent range of historical sales prices 
the terms of sale with respect to drs s require that the company perform installation due to the technical expertise required for this product 
due to the nature of the post shipment installation obligations with respect to the drs s  the company defers revenue recognition on the sale of drs s until installation has been completed 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due  to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  management estimates a reserve for bad debts based upon the total accounts receivable balance and the percentage expected to be realized through subsequent cash collections 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories on a quarterly basis  the company compares the amount of inventory on hand and under commitment with its latest forecasted requirements and historical usage or sales to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
although the write downs for excess or obsolete inventory reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and are considered adequate by the company s management  there can be no assurance that these write downs will prove to be adequate over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with the company s inventory 
in addition  the company will reduce the carrying value of its finished goods inventory to net realizable value  if the selling price of the product is less than its cost 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  the company has approximately million of net deferred tax liabilities and thousand of net deferred tax assets  respectively  related principally to inventory basis differences and tax deductible goodwill amortization 
should future pretax book income and taxable income be considerably lower than projected  an increase to the valuation allowance may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
 and fasb staff position no

fsp no 
gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
the company is evaluating whether it might repatriate any of its million of undistributed foreign earnings  which is expected to be completed within a reasonable amount of time after additional guidance is published 
the evaluation is affected by many factors  including the company s projected cash requirements and the impact of the new tax law s one time deduction for qualifying repatriations 
if the company decides to repatriate foreign earnings  it estimates the potential income tax effect would be to record a tax liability at a rate of or less

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on demand deposits with banks and money market funds and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates the company manages its cash and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
the company s investment portfolios consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents and investments  with carrying amounts approximating market value 
assuming year end cash and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would have an approximate thousand impact on the annual interest income of the company 
foreign currency exchange rates operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates that are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
the company s net sales and services to foreign customers represented approximately of total net sales and services in  in and in the company expects net sales and services to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of its total net sales and services 
the company s net sales and services denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of its total net sales and services in  of its total net sales and services in and in the company generally has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
the aggregate foreign exchange gains and losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were thousand  thousand and thousand in  and  respectively 
changes in the euro and yen have the largest impact on the company s operating profits 
the company estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would not materially impact reported operating profits
