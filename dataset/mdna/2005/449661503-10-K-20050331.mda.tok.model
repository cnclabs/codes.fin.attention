also contributing to the decrease is the impairment of the note receivable from and undistributed losses on the equity investment in gwwi  of fset by the increased net income and related income taxes 
the increase in cash provided by operations from to reflects a net decrease in resort property held for vacation ownership interests sales and resort property under development due to increased sales and fewer additions in  the non cash gain on sale of property and equipment included in net income  and the undistributed losses on the equity investment in gwwi  net of decreased net income and related income tax expense  and the effect of common stock issued to employees in lieu of cash compensation in the company generates cash primarily from the sale of vacation ownership interests including upgrades  the financing of customer notes from such sales and resort operations 
because the company uses significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation ownership interests  but collects the cash on the customer notes receivable over a long period of time  borrowing against and or selling receivables is necessary to provide sufficient cash to fund its normal operations 
the fluctuations in cash provided by financing activities from million in to million in and million in  reflect greater net borrowings on notes payable related to construction costs in las vegas  nevada  los abrigados and kohl s ranch in  as well as the common stock dividends paid in and  net of the decrease in treasury stock purchases each year since and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under a private placement in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for regular federal income tax purposes  the company reports substantially all of its non factored financed vacation ownership interest sales under the installment method 
under the installment method  the company recognizes income on sales of vacation ownership interests only when the company receives cash either in the form of a down payment  as an installment payment or from proceeds from the sale of the customer note 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest may be imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the related tax is paid 
if the company is otherwise not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statemen ts do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method  as the interest expense is not estimable 
at december   the company s subsidiary  genesis  had federal nol carryforwards of approximately  which are limited as to usage  because they arise from built in losses of an acquired company 
in addition  such losses can only be utilized through the earnings of genesis and are limited to a maximum of  per year 
to the extent the entire  is not utilized in a given year  the difference may be carried forward to future years 
any unused genesis nols will expire in in addition  section of the code imposes additional limitations on the utilization of nols by a corporation following various types of ownership changes which result in more than a change in ownership of a corporation within a three year period 
such changes may result from new common stock issuances by the company or changes occurring as a result of filings with the securities and exchange commission of schedules d and g by holders of more than of the common stock  whether involving the acquisition or disposition of common stock 
if such a subsequent change occurs  the limitations of section would apply and may limit or deny the future utilization of the nol by the company  which could result in the company paying substantial additional federal and state taxes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of cash investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash because of capital additions and loans to customers in connection with the company s vacation ownership interest sales 
net cash used in investing activities in  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in as compared to and  is reflective of the decrease in notes receivable due to decreased sales of vacation ownership interests generated by the las vegas sales office in and early payoffs on hypothecated notes  as well as a decrease in purchases of property and equipment in due to a reduction in construction activity in las vegas 
customer defaults have a significant impact on cash available to the company from financing customer notes receivables  in that notes which are more than to days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  the company in effect must repay borrowings against such notes or buy back such notes if they were sold with recourse 
on april  effective january   the company formed the ilx resorts incorporated employee stock ownership plan and trust the esop 
the intent of the esop is to provide a retirement program for employees that aligns their interests with those of the company 
during the year ended december   the company contributed  to the esop and the esop used these funds to exercise options to purchase  shares of stock from the company 
in addition  in  the esop acquired  shares of common stock through a note guaranteed by the company see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company contributed  to the esop and the funds were used to repay the note guaranteed by the company 
the esop may purchase additional shares for future year contributions through loans made directly to the esop and guaranteed by the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces a variety of risks related to the operation of its business and the execution of its business strategy 
the company may not successfully execute its growth strategy 
a principal component of the company s growth strategy is to acquire additional improved and unimproved real estate for the construction and development of new convenient access resorts and varsity clubs  which are urban vacation ownership properties strategically situated in tourist destinations that are accessible to major population centers near prominent colleges and universities 
the company also plans to sell for development the acre parcel in las vegas  nevada  known as premiere park  as a tourist venue 
the company s ability to execute its growth strategy will depend upon a number of factors  including the following the availability of attractive resort development opportunities  its ability to acquire properties for such development opportunities on economically feasible terms  its ability to market and sell vacation ownership interests at newly developed or acquired resorts  its ability to manage newly developed or acquired resorts in a manner that results in customer satisfaction  and its ability to find a buyer for premiere park on acceptable terms 
in particular  the success of premiere vacation club will depend upon the company s ability to continue to acquire and develop a sufficient number of participating resorts to make membership interests attractive to consumers 
in addition  the success of the varsity clubs concept will be enhanced by the company s ability to successfully negotiate with universities proximate to its varsity clubs for access to the alumni  parents  and other persons affiliated with such universities 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful with respect to any or all of these factors 
the company may not be able to finance its growth 
the company intends to selectively acquire and develop new vacation ownership resorts and to continue to expand its existing resorts 
acquiring and developing new resorts will place substantial demands on its liquidity and capital resources  as well as on its personnel and administrative capabilities 
risks associated with development and construction activities include  but are not limited to  the following construction costs or delays may exceed original estimates  which could make the development or expansion uneconomical or unprofitable  sales of vacation ownership interests or other revenue from newly completed facilities may not be sufficient to make the resort or development profitable  financing may not be available on terms favorable for development of a project  and financing may not be available on terms favorable for the continued sales of vacation ownership interests in a particular project 
the company s ability to obtain needed financing and to repay any indebtedness at maturity may depend on refinancing or future sales of debt or equity  which may not be available on terms favorable to the company 
factors that could affect access to the capital markets  or the cost of such capital  include the following changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  the threat of war or terrorist activities  the perception in the capital markets of the vacation ownership industry  the company s business  and its business prospects  the results of operations  and the amount of debt the company has outstanding and its financial condition 
the company faces risks associated with its ability to acquire properties that are suitable for development 
the company s ability to execute its growth strategy will depend to a significant degree on the existence of attractive project acquisition opportunities 
currently  there are numerous potential buyers for these properties 
many of these potential buyers have a stronger capital structure and greater resources with which to acquire attractive resort opportunities 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against such buyers 
a variety of comprehensive federal  state  and local laws regulate development and construction activities  as well as ownership  sales  and management of real estate 
these laws relate to many issues that directly or indirectly affect the business  including the following marketing and sales  building design and construction  zoning  land use  and development  water supplies  environmental and health concerns  and protection of endangered species 
any difficulties in or delays in obtaining  or the inability to obtain  the requisite licenses  permits  allocations  authorizations  and other entitlements pursuant to such laws could adversely impact the company s ability to develop and operate its projects 
the enactment of slow growth or no growth initiatives or changes in labor or other laws in any area where projects are located also could delay  affect the cost or feasibility of  or preclude entirely the development or expansion of the resorts 
the company may face a variety of risks when expanding its resorts 
the company s growth strategy includes the expansion of a number of units at its resorts  when appropriate 
risks associated with such expansion include  but are not limited to  the following construction costs may exceed original estimates  which could make the expansion uneconomical  construction or conversion may not be completed as scheduled  which could result in delayed recognition of revenue and increased interest expense  there may be delays in obtaining  or an inability to obtain  applicable governmental permits and authorizations  the company may not be able to obtain necessary financing on favorable terms and  market demand may not be sufficient to make such expansion profitable 
accordingly  the company cannot provide assurance that it will complete all planned expansion of its resorts or  if completed  that such expansion will be profitable 
the company may face additional risks as it expands into new markets 
the company s growth strategy consists of acquiring and developing additional resorts in the western united states and mexico  including markets in which it currently does not have an ilx resort or conduct any sales or marketing activities 
the company s prior success in the geographic locations in which it currently operates does not ensure continued success as it acquires  develops or operates future resorts 
accordingly  in connection with expansion into new markets  there may be a number of risks  including  but not limited to  the following a lack of familiarity and understanding of local consumer preferences  an inability to attract  hire  train  and retain additional sales  marketing  and resort staff at competitive costs  an inability to obtain  or to obtain in a timely manner  necessary permits and approvals from state and local government agencies and qualified construction services at acceptable costs  an inability to capitalize on new marketing relationships and development agreements  and the uncertainty involved in  and additional costs associated with  marketing vacation ownership interests prior to completion of marketed units 
the company s practice of financing customer borrowings exposes it to liquidity risks 
the company typically finances approximately of overall sales of vacation ownership interests 
although it conducts credit pre approval due diligence with respect to each financed sale  there are significant risks associated with such transactions  including those set forth below 
the company could incur substantial losses if purchasers of vacation ownership interests default on their obligations to pay the balance of the purchase price 
purchasers are required to make a down payment of at least of the aggregate purchase price of the vacation ownership interest and to deliver a promissory note for the balance 
although it conducts credit pre approval due diligence with respect to each purchaser  the company bears the risk of default associated with customer notes that it retains and those that it sells with recourse to the company 
if a buyer of a vacation ownership interest defaults  the company generally pursues collection remedies to the extent legally permitted 
although in many cases it may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price  certain states  including arizona and indiana  have laws that limit the ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
if unable to collect the defaulted amount or to obtain a voluntary quitclaim to the mortgaged interes t  the company likely will foreclose on and then remarket the recovered vacation ownership interest 
irrespective of the remedy in the event of a default  the company cannot recover the marketing  selling  and administrative costs associated with the original sale and must incur such costs again to resell the vacation ownership interest 
in addition  the costs associated with exercising collection and foreclosure remedies can be high relative to the value of the underlying asset 
the company generally does not carry private mortgage insurance or its equivalent to cover defaults on customer notes 
the company sells or hypothecates that is  borrows against the majority of its customer notes 
when customer notes are sold  the purchasers generally have recourse to the company 
as a result  it may be required to repurchase or replace any such customer note that becomes delinquent 
these contingent obligations are taken into account in establishing the allowance for uncollectible notes 
the company cannot provide assurance that such allowances will be adequate to offset actual defaults under customer notes  including notes that are sold with recourse to the company 
its financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the allowances are inadequate to cover actual defaults 
the company s borrowing base and or its ability to sell customer notes may be adversely affected by the nature and quality of the customer notes 
the company typically finances its working capital needs either by selling or by hypothecating customer notes that meet certain criteria established by third party lenders 
as of december   the company had agreements with one lender to borrow up to million against conforming retained customer notes  of which approximately million remained available for borrowing 
in addition  as of december   it had an agreement with one lender under which the company can sell up to million of conforming customer notes  of which approximately million remained available 
once hypothecated or sold  the company s customers make payments on their notes directly to the lender s collection center or agent 
all of a customer s payments on hypothecated notes are applied to the company s loan balance  both principal and interest 
historically  borrowings and sales of notes have not approached the maximum amount available under existing credit facilities 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that future working capital needs will not exceed amounts available under its credit facilities 
to the extent that the company generates additional customer notes through its sales efforts  it may pledge or sell the applicable customer notes  subject to applicable restrictions 
the company generally experiences negative cash flow upon the sale of financed vacation ownership interests 
on financed sales  the company ordinarily receives only of the purchase price on the sale of a vacation ownership interest  but must pay in full the costs associated with the development  marketing  and sale of the vacation ownership interest 
these costs generally exceed the down payment received at the time of sale 
maximum borrowings and sales of notes available under existing credit facilities may not be sufficient to cover these costs  which could limit available capital resources  liquidity  and capacity to grow 
the company s existing credit facilities expire at various dates through the company presently does not have binding agreements to extend the terms of its existing credit facilities or for any replacement financing upon the expiration of its existing credit facilities 
moreover  the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to arrange alternati ve or additional credit facilities on terms that are satisfactory to the company in the future 
accordingly  future sales of vacation ownership interests may be limited by the availability of funds to finance the initial negative cash flow that often results from sales that are financed 
although the company currently sells customer notes at a premium  to the extent that it finances negative cash flow by selling customer notes to lenders in the future such notes may only be able to be sold at a discount from the face value 
in addition  the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to negotiate the sale of such customer notes at favorable rates  or at all 
fluctuations in interest rates and interest rate mismatches could adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
the company currently derives a portion of income from the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the interest rates at which it borrows against customer notes or at which it sells customer notes 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that the present interest rate spread will continue in the future 
the company may not be able to maintain these spreads as a result of decreases in the rates charged to customers or increases in the prime lending rate  or upon the expiration of its current credit facilities and its inability to replace such facilities at existing terms 
in addition  the company s indebtedness bears interest at variable rates while the retained customer notes bear interest at fixed rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could cause interest expense to exceed interest income on the company s portfolio of retained customer not es 
moreover  the company currently does not engage in interest rate hedging transactions 
therefore  any increase in interest rates  particularly if sustained  could have a material adverse effect on results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
further  to the extent interest rates generally decrease on third party financing available to customers  there is an increased risk that customers will pre pay customer notes and reduce income  if any  from financing activities 
in addition  if a customer prepays a note that was sold  the company may be required to repay the unearned interest premium  if any  on the note 
the mismatch between customer notes and the company s credit facilities could create significant liquidity risks 
customer notes typically have a seven year term  while the company s related revolving credit facilities mature or expire on different dates over the next six years 
accordingly  a mismatch exists between anticipated cash receipts and cash disbursements 
although the company historically has been able to secure financing sufficient to fund operations  there are currently no agreements with lenders to extend the respective terms of existing credit facilities or to replace such credit facilities upon their expiration 
the failure to obtain such refinancing or replacement credit facilities could require the company to sell its portfolio of retained customer notes  potentially at a discount  or to seek other alternatives to enable it to continue in business 
while the company has been successful in obtaining financing to date  it cannot provide assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
the failure to do so in the future could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and liquidity 
the company faces stiff competition in the vacation ownership industry 
the vacation ownership industry consists of a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators 
in addition  the company faces competition from some of the world s most recognized national and international lodging  hospitality  and entertainment companies  such as marriott ownership resorts  the walt disney company  hilton hotels corporation  hyatt corporation  four seasons hotels resorts and cendant corporation 
many of these companies have much greater access to capital and other resources than the company 
as a result  it may be at a competitive disadvantage with its competitors for access to marketing  personnel  and other resources required to compete successfully 
in addition  competition from other vacation ownership resort developers and operators may limit the company s ability to acquire additional resorts and to obtain access to affinity groups 
the business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if the company is unable to compete successfully against such companies 
in addition to the competitors named above  the company s resorts and sales offices may face direct competition from smaller  local vacation ownership companies with resorts or sales offices within the vicinity of its resorts  as well as from resales of vacation ownership interests 
the company is also subject to competition from other entities engaged in the commercial lodging business  including condominiums  hotels and motels  and others engaged in the leisure business who compete by offering easy access  including online through proprietary web sites and internet travel intermediaries  to competitive nightly rates on luxury resort accommodations in desirable locations  which could reduce demand for the company s vacation ownership interests 
the company anticipates that it will continue to face substantial competition in all aspects of its operations from organizations that are more experienced in the leisure industry and that have greater access to financial  marketing  and other resources 
as a result  these competitors may have greater negotiating leverage to acquire properties or other resources required to compete or may be able to take advantage of greater gross sales and thereby reduce the retail price of their vacation ownership interests 
the company s profit margins and operating results could be adversely affected if it finds it necessary to reduce prices in order to remain competitive 
a reduction in profit margins as a result of competitive pressures  or an increase in costs relative to such competitors costs  could have a material adverse effect on results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
the company s success depends upon key management employees 
the company relies upon certain key management employees 
the loss of any key employee could materially and adversely affect the business 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to retain key members of the current management team or that it will be able to attract experienced personnel in the future 
the company s success also depends upon its ability to attract and maintain qualified property acquisition  development  marketing  management  administrative  and sales personnel 
the ability to attract  train  and retain such personnel will become particularly important as the company grows and develops additional resorts  and it cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the company is not able to attract and retain such key personnel 
the company s business could be adversely affected by its geographic concentration within the western united states  particularly arizona 
as of the date of this form k  a majority of the company s customers and resort accommodations are located in arizona 
as a result  the financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by local arizona economic downturns  changing demographics or regulatory changes 
further  the company s growth strategy includes expansion of sales centers and vacation ownership interests in the western united states and mexico 
although expansion into markets other than arizona may reduce the susceptibility to downturns in the arizona market  there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully apply its current operating strategy to new markets beyond arizona 
in addition  because the company intends to execute its growth strategy primarily in the western united states  it will continue to be particularly susceptible to adverse changes in econom ic circumstances  demographic trends or regulatory changes affecting the western united states in general and  in particular  the local markets that it enters 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to offset or minimize the adverse effects of such circumstances upon its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s ability to successfully market its properties will depend upon continued availability of viable exchange networks 
the company s ability to successfully market and sell vacation ownership interests will depend in part upon the availability of exchange networks  which allow owners of vacation ownership interests to trade the time they have purchased for time at another participating vacation ownership resort 
all vacation ownership interests that the company currently offers are qualified for inclusion in one or more exchange networks 
the company cannot provide assurances  however  that it will be able to continue to qualify additional properties or that such exchange networks will continue to be available for the existing portfolio of vacation ownership interests 
if such networks cease to function effectively or if the company is unable to respond to consumer demand for greater choices of desirable locations  it will be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors th at can offer such choices 
as a result of such disadvantages  the company may be unable to sell a sufficient number of vacation ownership interests or make sales at prices that will enable it to remain profitable 
the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks 
the company faces significant risks associated with leverage 
the company anticipates that it will finance future business activities  in whole or in part  with indebtedness obtained pursuant to additional borrowings under existing credit facilities or under credit facilities obtained in the future 
the definitive agreements with respect to these credit facilities do and could contain restrictive covenants that limit the ability to  among other things  make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  and dispose of assets or that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
the indebtedness incurred under these credit facilities may be secured by mortgages on all or a portion of the resorts  customer notes  and other assets 
if the company defaults under one or more of these credit facilities  its lenders could foreclose on the vacation ownership properties secured by a mortgage or deed of trust or take possession of other assets pledged as collateral 
in addition  future credit facilities may not provide for the lender to release liens on the company s vacation ownership interests when it sells such interests 
such restrictions could impair the marketability of the vacation ownership interests 
the extent of the company s leverage and the terms of indebtedness  such as requirements that it maintain certain debt to equity ratios  the ability to obtain additional financing in the future  to make acquisitions  or to take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise  could also be impaired 
furthermore  the company s indebtedness and related debt service obligations may increase its vulnerability to adverse general economic and vacation ownership industry conditions and to increased competitive pressures 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will not require additional indebtedness in the foreseeable future to execute its growth strategy 
extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations affect the way the company conducts business 
the federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which the company conducts business have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which it markets and sells vacation ownership interests and conducts its other business operations 
federal legislation to which the company is or may be subject includes the federal trade commission act  the fair housing act  the truth in lending act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the equal credit opportunity act  the interstate land sales full disclosure act  the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act and the civil rights acts of  and in addition  many states  including arizona  have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of vacation ownership interests 
these laws and regulations require the company  among other things  to obtain and file numerous documents and sup porting information with the responsible state agency  to obtain the agency s approval for an offering statement that describes all material aspects of the sale of vacation ownership interests  and to deliver an offering statement or public report  together with certain additional information concerning the terms of the purchase  to all prospective purchasers of a vacation ownership interest 
laws in each state where the company currently sells vacation ownership interests generally grant the purchaser of a vacation ownership interest the right to cancel a contract of purchase at any time within three to seven calendar days following the date the purchaser signs the contract 
most states also have other laws that regulate the company s activities and protect purchasers  such as the following real estate licensure laws  travel sales licensure laws  anti fraud laws  consumer protection laws  telemarketing laws  and prize  gift  and sweepstakes laws 
the company is currently authorized to market and sell interests in all states in which its resorts are located and all states in which it markets and sells vacation ownership interests 
it may apply for the right to conduct sales operations in additional states throughout the united states 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that any state will grant  or continue to grant  it the right to sell vacation ownership interests in such states or that  if such right to conduct sales operations is granted  it will be granted on acceptable terms and conditions 
further  if agents or employees of the company violate such regulations or licensing requirements  such acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew the licenses required to permit the sale of vacation ownership interests in such states 
the company believes it is in material compliance with applicable federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the sale and marketing of vacation ownership interests to which it is currently subject 
from time to time  however  consumers file complaints against the company in the ordinary course of business 
significant costs could be incurred to resolve such complaints or to qualify under applicable regulations in all jurisdictions in which the company desires to conduct sales 
it cannot provide assurance  however  that it will remain in material compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  or that violations of applicable laws will not have adverse implications for the company  including  without limitation  negative public relations  potential litigation  and regulatory sanctions 
the expense  negative publicity  and potential sanctions ass ociated with the failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
in particular  increased regulations of telemarketing activities could adversely impact the marketing of vacation ownership interests 
under certain conditions  vacation ownership interests may be considered securities under state or federal law  in which case the company would be subject to the time consuming and expensive requirements to register such interests  license salespeople  and comply with other regulations 
although the company s vacation ownership interests are not considered to be securities in any jurisdiction in which it operates as of the date of this form k  the company cannot guarantee that it can structure vacation ownership interests so as to avoid regulation as securities under applicable federal or state laws that may be adopted in the future or in any jurisdiction in which it may operate in the future 
if vacation ownership interests are deemed to be securities  the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to comply with the applicable state and federal securiti es requirements or that the liabilities or contingencies that result from such compliance will be immaterial 
as a result  such compliance may impact the ability to conduct business and may undermine the value of the company s common stock 
the company may be subject to litigation which could cause it to incur significant expenses 
responding to litigation claims could be costly and time consuming  and divert management s attention from other business issues 
in september  the company received pleadings indicating that a lawsuit against the company and its sedona vacation club and premiere vacation club businesses was filed by two individuals claiming damages for deceptive and abusive practices on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of vacation ownership interests 
the company  sedona vacation club and premiere vacation club received amended complaints in may and june in both instances  named plaintiffs were added and deleted 
the amended complaints are considerably more narrow in scope than the initial complaint 
the suit alleges claims for breach of the arizona consumer fraud act  the arizona real estate timeshare act  breach of contract and unjust enrichment 
a motion for class cer tification was filed in october which contained the deletion of three existing class members and the proposed addition of three new class members 
the company and its counsel believe that the allegations are without merit and are vigorously defending plaintiffs claims 
the company responded to the complaint  asserted counterclaims and filed certain motions in may and filed a disclosure statement in july the company deposed the three individuals whom plaintiff s counsel has identified as purported class representatives 
the plaintiffs have taken no depositions 
all matters in the litigation have been stayed by stipulation and order while the company and plaintiffs seek to negotiate a settlement 
the ultimate effect to the company is currently unknown 
excessive claims for construction related defects could adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
while the company engages third party contractors to construct or renovate its resorts  customers may assert construction claims against the company for construction defects 
in addition  certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of such property 
an excessive number of claims for construction related defects could adversely affect the liquidity  financial condition  and operating results 
environmental liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the business 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as common law  the company may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on  in  or emanating from property that it owns  leases  or operates  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage at such property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the company knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the ability to sell or lease property or to borrow money using such real property as collateral 
noncompliance with environmental  health or safety requirements may require the company to cease or alter operations at one or more of its properties 
further  it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of the properties 
although the company typically conducts significant due diligence prior to acquiring real property  it may not obtain phase i environmental reports with respect to each of its properties if management believes that the risk of potential environmental liability does not warrant the performance of phase i assessments due to the remote location of such property or any other reason 
if the company fails to obtain such reports  it may acquire or develop property and later discover that it cannot operate the property as planned  or may assume environmental or other liabilities that could have been avoided if it had the information typically revealed in a phase i report 
to date  the company has obtained environmental reports with respect to three of its resorts 
even when the company performs due diligence investigations  it cannot provide assurance that the due diligence efforts or phase i report s  when available  will reveal all environmental liabilities or that it will identify every material environmental condition 
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property may not relieve an owner of such liability 
thus  the company may have liability with respect to properties that it or its predecessors sold in the past 
acceleration of deferred taxes and net operating loss carryforward limitations could adversely affect the company s financial condition and liquidity 
while the company reports sales of vacation ownership interests as income for financial reporting purposes upon closing a sale  federal income tax regulations allow it to report a portion of financed sales on the installment method  if so elected 
when electing the installment method  the company recognizes income on the sale of a vacation ownership interest a when it receives cash in the form of a down payment  and b incrementally as it receives payments on retained customer notes or when it factors the customer note 
as of december   the company had deferred taxes ie  taxes owed to taxing authorities in the future as a consequence of income previously reported in its financial statements in the amount of million as a result of this method of reporting sales of vacation ownership interests 
if the company should factor the customer notes  if a lender forecloses on the r etained customer notes  or if the company otherwise collects or disposes of the retained customer notes  the deferred gain would be reportable for tax purposes and the deferred taxes  including interest on those taxes  if any  would become due 
moreover  it would accrued interest on such deferred taxes that would be payable when the taxes are due in the event the deferred taxes reverse in a year when income taxes are payable by the company  the likelihood of which is not now reasonably ascertainable 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient cash resources to pay those taxes and interest if and when they become payable 
at december   the company s subsidiary  genesis  had federal nol carryforwards of approximately  these nol carryforwards are limited as to usage because they arise from built in losses of an acquired company 
in addition  such losses can only be utilized through the earnings of genesis and are limited to a maximum of  per year 
to the extent the entire  is not utilized in a given year  the difference may be carried forward to future years 
any unused genesis nols will expire in in addition  section of the internal revenue code imposes additional limitations on the utilization of nols by a corporation following various types of ownership changes that result in more than a change in ownership of the corporation within a three year period 
such changes may occur as a result of new common stock issuances by the company or changes occurring as a result of filings with the sec on schedules d and g by holders of more than of its common stock  whether involving the acquisition or disposition of common stock 
if such a subsequent change occurs  the limitations of section would apply and may limit or deny our ability to use the nols in the future  which could require the company to pay substantial additional federal and state taxes 
the limited resale market for vacation ownership interests could adversely affect the company s business 
based on the experience with its resorts and ownership of vacation ownership interests at destination resorts owned by third parties  the company believes that resales of vacation ownership interests generally are made at net sales prices below their original customer purchase price 
the relatively lower sales price is partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with initial sales of such vacation ownership interests 
accordingly  the initial purchase of a vacation ownership interest may be less attractive to prospective buyers 
also  buyers who seek to resell their vacation ownership interests may compete with efforts to sell vacation ownership interests 
while vacation ownership interest resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on the business  if a secondary market for vacation ownership interests were to become more organize d and liquid  the availability of resale vacation ownership interests at lower prices could adversely affect the company s prices and the number of sales it can close 
as a result  the business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
downturns in general economic conditions can significantly impact the company s financial condition and operating results 
any adverse change in general economic conditions  significant price increases  or adverse occurrences affecting the travel and tourism industry  such as the impact of war or terrorist activity  cyclical overbuilding in the hotel and vacation ownership industries and the financial condition of the airline industry and the impact on air travel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
such conditions or occurrences also may have an adverse effect upon the availability and cost of financing for the company and its customers  which could preclude the company from making loans to customers for vacation ownership interest purchases or prevent its customers from paying off outstanding customer notes 
the company could incur costs to comply with laws governing accessibility of facilities by disabled persons 
a number of state and federal laws  including the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act  impose requirements related to access and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities 
although the company believes its resorts are substantially in compliance with laws governing the accessibility by disabled persons  it may incur additional costs to comply with such laws at existing or subsequently acquired resorts 
additional federal  state  and local legislation with respect to access by disabled persons may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company 
it cannot forecast the ultimate cost of compliance with such legislation  but such costs could be substantial and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company may have losses that are not covered by insurance 
the company carries comprehensive liability  business interruption  title  fire and storm insurance with respect to its resorts  with policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties  which it believes are adequate 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses caused by floods  acts of terrorism  or acts of war that are not generally insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  the company could lose its capital invested in a resort  as well as the anticipated future revenues from such resort and would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
increased gasoline prices  an outbreak of war  acts of terrorism  or similar events could negatively impact the company s business 
increased gasoline prices  war  or acts of terrorism  or similar events could reduce consumer travel 
if consumer travel to the company s resorts and sales centers declines as a result of these or other factors  it could experience lower income due to reduced room rentals and or fewer opportunities for sales presentations to prospective purchasers of vacation ownership interests 
the business is subject to seasonality and variability of quarterly results 
the company has historically experienced quarterly fluctuations in its gross revenue and net income from operations 
sales of vacation ownership interests typically have been lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year and this trend is expected to continue in the future 
in addition  earnings may be adversely affected by the company s ability to acquire or develop new resorts in a timely manner  fluctuations in travel and vacation patterns  and weather or other natural phenomena 
as the company enters new markets  it may experience additional fluctuations in quarterly results or an increased impact of seasonality on the business and results of operations 
certain of its existing shareholders have the ability to exert a significant amount of control over the company 
under arizona law  holders of the company s common stock are entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors 
cumulative voting permits each holder of common stock to cast an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of directorships to be filled  multiplied by the number of shares of common stock as to which the holder is entitled to cast votes 
each holder may cast all of such votes in favor of any individual nominee or may allocate them among multiple nominees as the holder chooses 
as a result  a holder of less than a majority of the outstanding common stock may elect one or more directors by casting all of his or her respective votes in favor of a single candidate 
the company currently has nine directors 
consequently  a holder of approximately of the outstanding common stock will be able to independently elect one director 
at february   joseph p 
martori beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock and all of the officers and directors as a group beneficially owned approximately of outstanding common stock 
because of his ability to elect at least two directors  if the interests of mr 
martori as a shareholder differ from the interests of the other shareholders  such other shareholders may be adversely affected 
to the extent that mr 
martori elects to reinvest dividends paid on his shares of common stock and some other shareholders do not reinvest their dividends  mr 
martori s percentage ownership of outstanding common stock will increase  which could further increase mr 
martori s control over the company 
at february   the esop held approximately of outstanding common stock 
joseph p 
martori  nancy j 
stone and joseph p 
martori  ii are trustees of the esop  although the employee beneficiaries of the esop have the ability to vote the number of shares in the esop that have been allocated to their respective accounts 
the esop may acquire newly issued shares of common stock from the company or already issued shares on the open market 
as the esop continues to acquire shares  an increasing concentration of the ownership will reside with the company s employees  including its executive officers 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire the company 
as an arizona corporation  the articles of incorporation and arizona law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of the company  even when those attempts may be in the best interests of its shareholders 
the articles of incorporation also authorize the board of directors  without shareholder approval  to issue one or more series of preferred stock  which could have voting  liquidation  dividend  conversion  or other rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s stock price has been  and will likely continue to be  highly volatile  which may negatively affect its ability to obtain financing in the future 
the market price of the company s stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to factors including but not limited to fluctuation in interest rates and other conditions that could adversely affect real estate values in general or the market for vacation ownership interests in particular  price and volume fluctuations in the stock market at large which do not relate to the company s operating performance  and any failure to meet market expectations 
from january  through december   the closing price of the company s common stock as reported on the american stock exchange ranged from a high of to a low of 
the volatility of the stock price could negatively impact the company s ability to raise capital in the future 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if litigation were instituted on this basis  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources
