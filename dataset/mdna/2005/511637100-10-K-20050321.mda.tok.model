significant accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and the banks conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lakeland  newton  lakeland investment corp  lakeland nj investment corp 
and newton investment corp 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 

table of contents the principal estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses and the analysis of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes  among other factors  an analysis of historical loss rates  by category  applied to current loan totals 
however  actual losses may be higher or lower than historical trends  which vary 
actual losses on specified problem loans  which also are provided for in the evaluation  may vary from estimated loss percentages  which are established based upon a limited number of potential loss classifications 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also details historical losses by loan category  the resulting loss rates for which are projected at current loan total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans are also detailed 
all of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses may be subject to change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
interest income is accrued as earned on a simple interest basis 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when a loan is placed on such non accrual status  all accumulated accrued interest receivable is reversed out of current period income 
commercial loans days or more past due and still accruing interest must have both principal and accruing interest adequately secured and must be in the process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears unless the obligations are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
the company accounts for impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan and lease losses  core deposit intangible  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and securities available for sale 
the company accounts for goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
the company has tested the goodwill as of december  and has determined that it is not impaired

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
the company s net interest income is determined by i the volume of interest earning assets that it holds and the yields that it earns on those assets  and ii the volume of interest bearing liabilities that it has assumed and the rates that it pays on those liabilities 
net interest income increases when the company can use noninterest bearing deposits to fund or support interest earning assets

loans specifically evaluated are deemed impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
loans which are in process of collection will not be classified as impaired 
a loan is not impaired during the process of collection of payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate 
all commercial loans identified as impaired in excess of  are evaluated by an independent loan review consultant 
the company aggregates consumer loans and residential mortgages for evaluation purposes 
the company s policy concerning commercial non accrual loans states that  except for loans which are considered to be fully collectible by virtue of collateral held and in the process of collection  loans are placed on a non accrual status when payments are days delinquent or more 
it is possible for a loan to be on non accrual status and not be classified as impaired if the balance of such loan is relatively small and  therefore  that loan has not been specifically reviewed for impairment 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off in the period that the loss is identified 
until such time  an allowance for loan loss is maintained for estimated losses 
with regard to interest income recognition for payments received on impaired loans  as well as all non accrual loans  the company follows regulatory guidelines  which apply any payments to principal as long as there is doubt as to the collectibility of the loan balance 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company had impaired loans totaling million including million in non accrual loans 
the impairment of these loans is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for these loans

at december   the company also had million and  in loans that were rated substandard and doubtful  respectively  that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no loans at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired  substandard or doubtful where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date

the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans that have been designated as requiring attention by the company s external loan review consultant 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non criticized loans in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios and management s evaluation of key factors 
consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the preceding statement constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 
table of contents the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans in each category as well as historical trends

the company s management believes that its current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated operational needs including current loan commitments  deposit maturities and other obligations 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and relating to the extent to which market factors indicate that financial institutions such as the banks should match such assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  dollars in thousands total within one year after one but within within three years after three but within five years after five years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases benefit plan commitments remaining contractual maturities of time deposits subordinated debentures loan commitments long term borrowed funds standby letters of credit total interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is often measured by the extent to which mismatches or gaps occur in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
gap analysis is utilized to quantify such mismatches 
a positive gap results when the amount of earning assets repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within that time period 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of earning assets repricing within such time period 
in general  a financial institution with a positive gap in relevant time periods will benefit from an increase in market interest rates and will experience erosion in net interest income if such rates fall 
likewise  a financial institution with a negative gap in relevant time periods will normally benefit from a decrease in market interest rates and will be adversely affected by an increase in rates 
by maintaining a balanced interest rate sensitivity position  where interest rate sensitive assets roughly equal interest sensitive liabilities in relevant time periods  interest rate risk can be limited 

table of contents as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer  chief credit officer  certain other senior officers and certain directors 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 
the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis also known as gap analysis and an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
traditional gap analysis involves arranging the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference or interest rate sensitivity gap between the assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period 
both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice  and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount 
gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  except as stated below  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability 
the majority of interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be core deposits  or deposits that will generally remain at the company regardless of market interest rates 
therefore  of the core interest bearing deposits  of core savings deposits and of money market deposit accounts are shown as maturing or repricing within three months 
the remainder is divided between the after but within years column and the after years column 
interest bearing transaction accounts held by states and municipalities are seen to be more sensitive than personal interest bearing transaction accounts 
therefore  of public interest bearing transaction accounts are shown as repricing within three months 
the table does not assume any prepayment of fixed rate loans 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

therefore  these techniques may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above  members of the company s asset liability management committee believe that the interest sensitivity modeling more accurately reflects the effects and exposure to changes in interest rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the company s net portfolio value at december  using current discount rates  and an estimate of net interest income for assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at december  levels 
the information provided for the net portfolio value assumes fluctuations or rate shocks of plus basis points and minus basis points 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately 
the information provided for net interest income for assumes that changes in interest rates of plus basis points and minus basis points change gradually in equal increments over the twelve month period

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the aicpa issued sop accounting for loans or certain debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop applies to a loan with the evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination acquired by completion of a transfer for which it is probable at acquisition  that the company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable 
sop requires that the company recognize the excess of all cash flows expected at acquisition over the investor s initial investment in the loan as interest income on a level yield basis over the life of the loan as the accretable yield 
the loan s contractual required payments receivable in excess of the amount of its cash flows expected at acquisition nonaccretable difference should not be recognized as an adjustment to yield  a loss accrual or a valuation allowance for credit risk 
sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this statement on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
management will continue to evaluate the effects of this statement when it subsequently evaluates loans and securities acquired in a transfer 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under fin if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management has determined that lakeland bancorp capital trust i  lakeland bancorp capital trust ii and lakeland bancorp capital trust iii collectively  the trusts qualify as a variable interest entities under fin the trusts issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the company 
the trusts hold  as their sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in the trusts were included in the company s consolidated balance sheet and statements of income at december  due to the company s ability to call the preferred stock prior to the mandatory redemption date and thereby benefit from a decline in required dividend yields 
subsequent to the issuance of fin  the fasb issued a revised interpretation  fin r  the provisions of which had to be applied to certain variable interest entities by march  the company adopted the provisions under the revised interpretation in the first quarter of fin r required the company to deconsolidate the trusts as of march  fin r precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if the company has the right to a majority of the trusts expected residual returns 
accordingly  the company deconsolidated the trusts at the end of the first quarter of  which resulted in an increase in outstanding debt by million 
the federal reserve has issued guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by the trusts as a result of the adoption of fin r 
the rule retains the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but enacts other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
the rule would take effect april   however  a five year transition period starting march  and leading up to march  allows bank holding companies to continue to count trust preferred securities as tier capital after applying fin r 
management has evaluated the effects of the proposed rule and anticipates that its ratios would still exceed the minimum ratios required to qualify as a well capitalized institution 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation act of in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb issued eitf abstract  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf

in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under sfas no 
r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  would be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
the expense of the award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date 
current accounting guidance requires that the expense relating to so called fixed plan employee stock options only be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  all public companies that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under sfas no

under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
the impact of this new standard  if it had been in effect  on the net earnings and related per share amounts the years ended december   and is disclosed in note summary of accounting policies stock based compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the banks attempt to structure their assets and liabilities and manage their gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  thus minimizing the potential effects of inflation
