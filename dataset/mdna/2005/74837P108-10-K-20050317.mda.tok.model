overview we operate in a single industry segment where we design and sell field programmable gate arrays  embedded standard products  associated software and programming hardware 
in  we introduced our first line of field programmable gate array products  or fpgas  based upon our vialink technology 
our mature product family consists of our three fpga product families pasic  pasic and pasic our newer fpga product families generally contain greater logic capacity  but do not necessarily replace sales of older generation products 
in september  we introduced our first line of embedded standard products  or esps  to address the design community s demand for an alternative to existing options application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and system on a chip products 
esp products embed standard functions on programmable logic devices 
these products provide engineers with the ease of use  guaranteed functionality  high performance  low non recurring engineering charges and immediate availability of application specific standard products  or assps  combined with the flexibility and time to market advantages of programmable logic 
our esp product families include quickram  quickpci  and v products 
our advanced esp product families include quickmips  eclipse  eclipse ii and quickpci ii products 
we also license our quickworks and quicktools design software and sell our programming hardware and include these sales as advanced esp revenue 
our newest products target low power  high performance applications where system designers want to add features to or improve the performance of a system through the use of fpga devices 
our products generally target complex  high performance embedded systems in rapidly changing markets where system manufacturers seek to minimize time to market and maximize product differentiation and functionality 
our product offering includes the lowest power fpgas available in the industry today  enabling designers to utilize the high performance of our fpga architecture in low power embedded systems 
compared to our competitors sram based fpgas  our devices provide a higher level of intellectual property security since it is extremely difficult to clone or reverse engineer intellectual property that is implemented using our one time programmable vialink technology 
we compete in various markets  including instrumentation and test  data communications and telecommunications  consumer  video  audio and graphics imaging  high performance computing  and military and aerospace systems 
we expect that consumer applications will represent a higher proportion of our revenue based on current customer design activity 
our proprietary vialink programmable metal to metal technology is the core of our fpga product families and the foundation of our esp product families 
along with our user programmable platform and the associated software tools used for system design  we are able to provide our customers with a complete design capability 
our vialink technology allows us to create devices smaller than competitors comparable products  thereby minimizing silicon area and cost 
in addition  our vialink technology has lower electrical resistance and capacitance than other programmable technologies and  consequently  supports higher signal speed and low power consumption 
our user programmable platform facilitates full utilization of a device s logic cells  clocks and input output pins 
these logic cells have been optimized to efficiently implement a wide range of logic functions at high speed  thereby enabling greater usable device density and design flexibility 
our architecture uses our vialink technology to maximize interconnects at every routing wire intersection  which allows more paths between logic cells 
as a consequence  system designers are able to use our devices with smaller gate counts to implement their designs than if they had used competing fpgas 
the abundance of interconnect resources also provides a dense connection between the assp and the fpga portions of embedded standard products 
finally  our software enables our customers to efficiently implement their designs using our products 
we believe that important industry trends in our target markets include lower power consumption  higher performance  shorter time to market  intellectual property security  higher development expenses and asic product development risks 
we believe our products are designed to address many of these trends 
the market for programmable logic devices is expected to grow more quickly than the semiconductor industry  and we believe the fpga programmable logic market will grow more quickly than the market for complex programmable logic devices 
one factor fueling this high growth is the migration from asic circuit designs to programmable logic circuit designs 
system designers often choose programmable logic solutions over asic solutions  due to the relatively low development cost  low development risk  quick time to market and high adaptability or flexibility of programmable logic devices  and due the to ability of programmable logic suppliers to reduce the unit costs of their products over time 
technology developed for personal computer applications  such as micro hard disk drives and wi fi communication modules  is gaining traction in embedded applications  as embedded system designers seek to improve the value of their systems by incorporating these features into embedded systems 
this adoption of new features by embedded system designers is increasing the use of programmable logic  since embedded processors often do not have the native ability to interface to components such as wi fi modules or micro hard drives  which were designed to work in a personal computer environment 
our fpga devices have compelling advantages in these programmable interconnect applications  where customers benefit from the low power consumption  small form factor and high bandwidth offered by our new eclipse ii and quickpci ii devices 
we believe that the market for low power embedded applications will be a relatively high growth market  as oems serving the consumer or professional portable markets accelerate the offering of devices such as pdas incorporating wi fi capability  wireless voip telephones  or consumer products utilizing a micro hard drive 
we believe our products offer bulletproof intellectual property security compared to sram based fpga or asic solutions 
we believe ip security will become important to system designers who choose to implement proprietary algorithms or features in programmable logic rather than asic devices 
in december  we entered into a share purchase agreement  foundry agreement and other related agreements  as amended  with tower semiconductor ltd  or tower 
under the terms of the agreements  we agreed to make a strategic investment of up to million in tower as part of tower s plan to build and equip a new wafer fabrication facility 
the facility produces mm wafers in geometries of micron  using advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  technology acquired from toshiba 
during and  we paid tower a total of million to fulfill our entire investment requirements under the terms of the agreement 
in partial consideration for the investment  we received  tower ordinary shares with an original cost of million 
we wrote down the tower shares due to an other than temporary decline in their market value by million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the carrying value of these shares following the write downs was per share 
if the fair value of our tower investment falls below per share for a period of time  we may record additional losses on this investment 
we also received million in prepaid wafer credits in consideration for the investment 
these credits can be applied toward wafer purchases from tower at of the value of current purchases and at of the value of purchases made after july  during fiscal  we sold  of the available for sale tower ordinary shares for total proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain in the amount of  under the terms of the agreement  we were restricted from selling  of the tower ordinary shares until january accordingly  the restricted shares were recorded as a long term asset at adjusted cost prior to january in january  we reclassified these shares from restricted to available for sale and began recording these shares at market value on our balance sheets 
as of december   we held  available for sale tower ordinary shares valued at per share  their market value on the last day of our fourth fiscal quarter of we intend to continue to hold  tower ordinary shares in order to receive competitive product pricing and  accordingly  have classified these shares as a long term investment on our balance sheets 
the remaining  shares are recorded as a short term investment on our balance sheets 
we sell programmed and unprogrammed products through distributors and directly to system manufacturers 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of products directly to system manufacturers 
however  we sell the majority of our products through point of sale distributors who earn a negotiated margin on the sale of our products 
we defer recognition of revenue from sales of unprogrammed products to point of sale distributors until after they have sold our products to systems manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on programmed products at the time of shipment to our point of sale distributors 
during  approximately of the units shipped to our point of sale distributors were programmed by us and  accordingly  are not returnable 
the percentage of sales derived through distributors was  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage of sales derived through direct sales was  and in   and  respectively 
three distributors of our products accounted for  and of revenue in three distributors of our products accounted for  and of revenue in two distributors accounted for and of our revenue in one chinese systems manufacturer  purchasing our products through a distributor  accounted for  and percent of revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that a limited number of distributors and customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue and that individual distributors could account for a larger portion of our revenue 
our international sales were  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
revenue from sales to international customers is expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
all of our sales originate in the united states and are denominated in us dollars 
we outsource the wafer manufacturing  assembly and test of all of our products 
we currently rely upon taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd  or tsmc  cypress semiconductor corporation  tower and samsung semiconductor  inc to manufacture our products  and we rely primarily upon amkor technology  inc and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc  or ase  to assemble  test and program our products 
our wafer suppliers lead times are often as long as three months and sometimes longer 
in addition  cypress and tower require us to provide them with a monthly wafer start forecast 
under the terms of our agreements with them  we are limited in the quantity that we can increase or decrease our wafer forecast and we are committed to take delivery of and pay for a minimum portion of the forecasted wafer volume 
our long manufacturing cycle times are at odds with our customers desire for short delivery lead times and  as a result  we typically purchase wafers based on our internal forecasts of customer demand 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our critical policies include revenue recognition including sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation including excess and obsolescence  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of investments  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and estimating accrued liabilities 
we believe that we apply judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue as products are shipped  if evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  services  if any  have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and product returns and sales allowances are reasonably estimable 
we sell products directly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and through distributors 
we ship programmed parts and unprogrammed parts 
distributors  other third parties or the end customer may program unprogrammed parts 
revenue is recognized upon shipment to oem customers 
we sell to certain distributors under agreements  which  in the case of unprogrammed parts  provide for certain rights of return  and price adjustments on unsold inventory 
these agreements generally permit the distributor to return unprogrammed parts  up to of the value of total products they purchase from us every six months 
upon shipment of unprogrammed parts to a distributor  we record an account receivable from the distributor  relieve inventory for the cost of the product shipped  and record the deferred gross profit  consisting of deferred revenue less the cost of this revenue  on the balance sheets as deferred income on shipments to distributors until the inventory is resold by the distributor 
revenue for programmed parts  for which there are no rights of return or price adjustments on unsold inventory  is recognized upon shipment to distributors 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided against accounts receivable 
a significant portion of our estimated sales allowances relate to our distributor business model 
our distributors earn a negotiated margin upon the resale of our products 
we manage this margin by selling inventory to distributors at list price and providing price adjustments to achieve the agreed upon distributor margin through a ship from stock and debit program 
under this program  we authorize price adjustments for specific resale transactions 
these adjustments are referred to as debit authorizations 
upon the resale of our product  the distributors submit a claim for a price adjustment based upon the terms of the debit authorization 
we accrue these price adjustments as a sales allowance from the time we recognize revenue until we approve the distributors claim for the price adjustment 
software revenue from the sale of design tool kits is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the software has occurred  we have no significant obligations with regard to implementation or integration  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
software products are less than of revenue 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
manufacturing overhead is included in product costs based on capacity 
we routinely evaluate the quantities and value of our inventory in light of current market conditions and market trends 
our analysis may take into consideration historic usage  expected demand  anticipated sales price  new product development schedules  the effect new products might have on sales of existing products  product obsolescence  customer design activity  customer concentrations  product merchantability and other factors 
market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of our inventory may differ from forecast demand 
during the introduction of a new product  we may begin production of products that have not been qualified and we may experience yields that are lower than anticipated 
such factors may be material to our financial statements 
historically  the lives of our products are unusually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of our inventories 
as a result of our evaluations  we have recorded reserves for quantities in excess of demand  cost in excess of market value  and product obsolescence 
we recorded charges against inventory of  million and million in  and  respectively 
in and  we recorded inventory reserves on several parts due to quantities in excess of expected demand 
during  we reserved inventory primarily due to the write down of two products to their net realizable value and due to the planned obsolescence of a product 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate uncollectible accounts receivable at each reporting period 
in specific  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable  bad debt history  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of december  valuation of investments at december   we held  available for sale tower ordinary shares valued at approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded as a short term investment 
the carrying value of these shares was per share at december  the available for sale securities are marked to market on our balance sheets at the end of each reporting period 
these changes are also reflected in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
if the market value of the available for sale shares changes during a reporting period  we record accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the equity section of our balance sheets and we increase or decrease the reported value of our shares to the market value 
if the market value of the shares were to decline below the carrying value and if the decline is determined to be other than temporary  we would record a write down of marketable securities as a charge to our statement of operations and reduce the carrying value of the shares 
during the third quarter of and the fourth quarters of and  we wrote down the value of our tower shares due to declines in value that we determined to be other than temporary 
this determination included factors such as market value and the period of time that the market value had been below carrying value 
the tower shares purchased in were obtained at an average price of per share 
in  we wrote down the carrying value for these shares by million  or to per share based on the market price of tower s stock at that time 
the tower shares we purchased in were obtained at an average price of per share 
at december   all tower shares held by us were written down by million  or to per share based on the market price of tower s stock at the end of our fiscal year 
at december   all tower shares held by us were written down by million  or to per share based on the market price of tower s stock at the end of our fiscal year 
as a result of recording the other than temporary write down of the tower ordinary shares at december   we have no accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheets as of that date 
a decline in the market value of the tower shares would have a  effect on the market value of the shares 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we assess whether the value of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill has been impaired annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future revenue and operating results  significant changes in expected demand for the related products  significant changes in the manner of our use of or the expected cash flow from the assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  significant negative economic events or trends affecting our business  a significant decline in our stock price  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
our assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of an asset or asset group from its expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the assessment indicates that cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
in  and  we wrote off long lived assets with a net book value of   and million  respectively  related to assets identified as having no future value to our operations 
as part of our annual budgeting process  we determined that the revenue outlook for certain portions of our business was lower than previously expected 
accordingly  we performed an impairment assessment on certain long lived assets associated with our business 
our assessment of the undiscounted cash flows indicated that these assets were impaired 
in order to determine the fair value of these assets  we performed a probability weighted assessment of the revenue and related cash flows  discounted using a risk free interest rate 
as a result  we recognized a million long lived asset impairment as an operating expense in order to write these assets down to their estimated fair market value 
this charge  which was associated with our quickmips product family  reduced the net carrying value of our property and equipment by million and our other long term assets by million 
while quickmips design activity continues and we promote the use of quickmips in new designs  we believe that our time to revenue from this product family will take longer than we had anticipated and that total revenue realized from this product family will be lower than previously expected 
on august   we acquired certain assets of v  a toronto based manufacturer of assps  for a total of million 
of this purchase consideration  we allocated approximately million to the net assets acquired  and million to goodwill 
we are required to perform an impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis  and when circumstances lead us to believe that impairment has occurred 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization  as implied by our stock price  dropped below our net asset value 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis 
as a result of the analysis  we recorded a non cash charge of million 
the charge completely wrote off the goodwill amount attributable to the v acquisition on our balance sheets and was included as a component of operating income in as the charge was non cash in nature  it did not affect our liquidity 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different tax and accounting treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization and employee related accruals 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  amounted to million as of december  we have also recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the uncertainty of our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
these carryforwards  if not utilized to offset future taxable income and income taxes payable  will expire beginning in for federal purposes and in for state purposes 
estimating accrued liabilities we review our accounts payable and accrued liabilities at each reporting period  and accrue liabilities as appropriate 
during this analysis we consider items such as manufacturing activity  commitments made to or the level of activity with vendors  payroll and employee related costs  historic spending  budgeted spending  and anticipated changes in the cost of services 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative long lived asset impairment goodwill impairment restructuring costs loss from operations write down of marketable securities gain on sale of investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
interest expense interest income and other  net net loss comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for and was million and million  respectively  representing a growth of million or from to the revenue increase was primarily due to increased sales volume of our pasic  pasic  eclipse and pasic product families  which increased by million  million  million  and  respectively 
the increase in our pasic and pasic product revenue was due to increased customer demand and end of life purchases 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decline in sales of our quickram product line  which benefited in from sales to one customer in china 
this customer  purchasing primarily quickram products through a distributor  accounted for of our revenue in as compared to of revenue in our combined esp and advanced esp products contributed and of our revenue in and  respectively 
our foundry agreement with the supplier that fabricates our pasic and pasic product families expires at the end of we have announced an end of life for these products and have asked our customers to take delivery of lifetime buy orders before the end of these product families contributed million and million of our revenue in and  respectively 
while we may have limited production capacity for these products beyond  we expect to experience a significant reduction in pasic and pasic revenue near the end of we currently believe that a majority of our customers that use pasic and pasic products will purchase enough product to satisfy demand throughout the expected life of their products rather than migrate to other quicklogic products  and that pasic and pasic products will contribute less than of our revenue by the first quarter of as a result  we could experience fluctuations in demand as customers build inventory of these products  design systems using devices supplied by others or reduce purchases of our products 
in order to maintain or grow our revenue from its current level after the end of life period for our pasic and pasic product families  we are dependent upon increased revenue from our existing product families  especially our new eclipse ii and quickpci ii products  and the development of additional commercially successful new products 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in and  respectively  which was and of revenue for those periods  respectively 
the million improvement in gross profit in was primarily due to changes in product mix and lower product costs which contributed to improved gross profit by approximately million  higher revenue which contributed to improved gross profit by approximately million  and lower additions to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve of  this was partially offset by higher unfavorable yield and other manufacturing variances of  primarily due to initial production of our new product families  one time charges totaling  related to wafers of one product not expected to yield usable die  and higher unabsorbed overhead variances of  in and  charges to inventory reserves were  and million  respectively 
the sale of previously reserved inventory reduced our cost of sales by million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million and million in and  respectively  which represented and of revenue for those periods 
the increase of approximately million in was primarily due to an increase of  in outside services and an increase of  for equipment and supplies  which were incurred primarily to bring our new eclipse ii and quickmips products to production in in and  research and development expense included  and  for the write off of long lived assets  respectively  primarily related to design software that is no longer in use 
other research and development expenses increased by approximately  during we believe that continued investments in product development and process technology are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we expect that these development efforts will allow us to expand our product offering and provide additional value to our customers and stockholders 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense was million and million in and  respectively  which represented and of revenue for those periods 
sg a expense remained relatively unchanged on a dollar basis in as compared to while declining as a percentage of revenue due to the proportionately greater increase in revenue during the  increase in sg a expense in as compared to was primarily the result of a million increase in consulting and auditing expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance matters and a computer software upgrade  partially offset by a decrease of  in additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts  a decrease of  in depreciation expense and a decrease of  in salary related expenses 
long lived asset impairment charge 
as part of our annual budgeting process  we determined that the revenue outlook for certain portions of our business was lower than previously expected 
accordingly  we performed an impairment assessment on certain long lived assets associated with our business 
our assessment of the undiscounted cash flows indicated that these assets were impaired 
in order to determine the fair value of these assets  we performed a probability weighted assessment of the revenue and related cash flows  discounted using a risk free interest rate 
as a result  in we recognized a million long lived asset impairment charge associated with our quickmips product family in order to write these assets down to their estimated fair market value 
while quickmips design activity continues and we promote the use of quickmips in new designs  we believe that our time to revenue from this product family will take longer than we had anticipated and that total revenue realized from this product family will be lower than previously expected 
deferred compensation 
as a result of granting stock options to employees at below market value  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  in no deferred compensation has been recorded as a result of stock option grants to employees since deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
we amortized  in and as of december  we had fully amortized these expenses 
the amortization of deferred compensation is recorded as research and development and sg a expenses  depending on the related employees activities 
write down of marketable securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our investment in tower stock had suffered a decline in value that was determined to be other than temporary 
this determination included factors such as market value and the period of time that the market value had been below the carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of based on the quoted market price of the stock on the last day of the reporting period 
as a result of this write down  the carrying value of our tower ordinary shares was per share at the end of our fiscal year  compared to per share at the end of fiscal unrealized income on available for sale tower ordinary shares included within stockholders equity was million at december  gain on sale of investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
in  we sold  available for sale tower ordinary shares for total proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain in the amount of  interest expense 
interest expense was  in as compared to  in this increase was primarily due to higher interest rates 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  includes interest income on invested cash  foreign exchange gains and losses  foreign tax provisions and interest expense on borrowings 
interest income and other  net  was income of  in as compared to income of  in the  improvement in interest income and other  net is primarily due to increased interest received as a result of higher invested average cash balances and higher interest rates 
we did not have significant foreign tax liabilities during the periods presented 
provision for income taxes 
in and  we incurred tax losses 
however  our ability to utilize these losses in future periods is uncertain and  accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related tax benefit 
as such  no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded for and as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards  if not utilized to offset future taxable income and income taxes payable  will expire beginning in for federal purposes and in for state purposes 
our net loss increased to million in from million in this million increase is primarily attributable to charges for long lived asset impairment of million and the write down of marketable securities of million that we did not incur in during  we recorded  of gains on the sale of tower shares 
during  our million increase in revenue and million improvement in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of million in combined research and development and sg a expenses 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for and was million and million  respectively  representing a growth of million  or  during the revenue increase was primarily due to increased sales volume of our quickram  eclipse  pasic  pasic and quickpci product families  which increased by million  million  million  million and million  respectively  offset by a decline in our pasic product line 
the increase in our quickram product line revenue was primarily due to higher sales to one customer in china 
our combined esp and advanced esp products contributed and of revenue in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in and  respectively  which was and of revenue for those periods 
the million improvement in gross profit in was primarily due to higher revenue which improved gross profit by approximately million  as a result of higher sales of reserved inventory   due to product mix   less scrapped inventory  and  less reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  partially offset by higher freight and other charges 
in and  charges to inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
the sale of previously reserved inventory reduced our cost of sales by million and  in and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million and million in and  respectively  which was and of revenue for those periods 
in  research and development expense includes  for the write off of long lived assets  primarily design software no longer in use 
in  research and development expense includes million for the write off of long lived assets 
this charge was triggered by the abandonment of certain product design activities and related technical decisions  and includes the write off of certain emulation hardware and intellectual property that we acquired in the v acquisition 
in addition to lower long lived asset write offs in  the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to lower compensation costs as a result of our fourth quarter reduction in force 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense was million and million in and  respectively  which was and of revenue for those periods 
sg a expense was higher in as compared to primarily due to an increase in commissions on higher revenue  consulting related to sarbanes oxley compliance activities  bad debt expense and marketing activities for our new products  partially offset by lower compensation costs as a result of our reduction in force in the fourth quarter of goodwill impairment 
on august   we acquired certain assets of v  a toronto based manufacturer of assps  for a total of million 
of this purchase consideration  we allocated approximately million to the net assets acquired  and million to goodwill 
we are required to perform an impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis  and when circumstances lead us to believe that impairment has occurred 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization  as implied by our stock price  dropped below our net asset value 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis 
as a result of the analysis  we recorded a non cash charge of million 
the charge completely wrote off the goodwill amount attributable to the v acquisition on our balance sheets and was included as a component of operating income in as the charge was non cash in nature  it did not affect our liquidity 
restructuring costs 
in november  we reduced our worldwide headcount by approximately and closed offices in la palma  california and richardson  texas 
we undertook this restructuring activity to better align our overhead and expenses with our level of revenue and gross profit 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a  restructuring charge for employee severance costs and office closure expenses 
there were no restructuring activities in deferred compensation 
as a result of granting stock options to employees at below market value  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  in no deferred compensation has been recorded as a result of stock option grants to employees since deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
we amortized  and  in and  respectively  and as of december  we had fully amortized these expenses 
the amortization of deferred compensation is recorded as research and development and sg a expenses  depending on the related employees activities

in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our investment in tower stock had suffered a decline in value that was determined to be other than temporary 
this determination included factors such as market value and the period of time that the market value had been below the carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of based on the quoted market price of the stock on the last day of the reporting period 
as a result of this and previous write downs  the carrying value of our tower ordinary shares was per share at the end of and gain on sale of investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
in  we sold  available for sale tower ordinary shares for total proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain in the amount of  interest expense  interest income and other  net 
in total  interest expense and interest income and other  net  was an expense of  in as compared to income of  in the  decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the amortization of loan fees charged in connection with our credit facility  lower returns on cash and marketable securities as a result of lower interest rates and foreign income tax expense 
provision for income taxes 
in and  we incurred tax losses 
however  our ability to utilize these losses in future periods is uncertain and  accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related tax benefit 
as such  no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded for and we reduced our net loss to million in from million in this million improvement is primarily attributable to higher net revenue of million  higher gross profit of million  a net reduction of million in combined research and development and sg a expenses  and a  gain on the sale of tower shares 
in addition  we incurred million of charges in that we did not incur in  including goodwill impairment  restructuring costs and the write down of marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating losses and capital investments through sales of common stock  private equity investments  capital and operating leases  bank lines of credit and cash flow from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of our cash and cash equivalents of million  available credit under our revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank of approximately million  available credit under our equipment line of credit of approximately million  and our short term investment in tower with a market value of approximately million 
as of december   our interest bearing debt consisted of million outstanding from silicon valley bank and  outstanding under a capital lease 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
capital expenditures  which are largely driven by the development of new products and manufacturing levels  could be up to million in the next twelve months 
in june  we modified our amended and restated loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
terms of the modified agreement include an million revolving line of credit available through june and an additional million of borrowing capacity under an equipment financing line of credit that is available to be drawn against through june the revolving line of credit provides for formula advances based upon a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and for non formula advances not to exceed million 
as of december  under the revolving line of credit  we had borrowed million and had available formula and non formula advances totaling million 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we drew a total of  against our equipment line of credit 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the existing and previous equipment lines of credit  with million available to be drawn against future equipment purchases 
advances under the equipment line of credit must be repaid in either or equal monthly installments  depending upon the nature of the items financed 
the bank has a first priority security interest in our tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the modified agreement 
under the terms and definitions of the modified agreement  we must maintain a minimum tangible net worth and adjusted quick ratio 
the modified agreement also has certain restrictions on other indebtedness  the maintenance of depository accounts and the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants as of december  as of december   we also had  outstanding under a capital lease obligation 
the capital lease obligation bears interest at per annum and is being repaid in quarterly amounts of  through october our consolidated statements of cash flows reflects the changes in our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
net cash from operating activities in and  our positive operating cash flow was  and million  respectively 
the positive cash flow resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  million of charges to cost of sales and operating expenses against long lived assets related primarily to the long lived asset impairment associated with our quickmips product family  a million write down of marketable securities related to the decline in market value of our tower shares  and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in the amount of  in addition  changes in working capital accounts used cash of  primarily as a result of increased inventories of million due to higher sales levels  build up of inventory in anticipation of pasic and pasic end of life purchases and the introduction of new products and a  increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments within the last quarter of the year 
these cash uses were partially offset by higher accounts payable  accrued liabilities  deferred income and other obligations of million due to higher manufacturing volumes and inventory levels and lower other assets of  due primarily to lower prepaid expenses 
in  our positive operating cash flow of million resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges and other items including depreciation and amortization of million  reserves for excess inventory in the amount of million   for the write off of long lived assets related to specific products that are not expected to achieve volume production and software that is no longer used in the development of our products  gains on the sale of tower shares of  and amortization of deferred compensation costs of  in addition  changes in working capital accounts provided cash of million primarily as a result of lower inventories of million due to higher sales levels and a reduction in the number of weeks of inventory on hand for several products  lower other assets of million due primarily to lower prepaid expenses and the termination of our deferred compensation plan  lower accounts receivable of million due to improved collection efforts  and higher accounts payable of  due to higher manufacturing volumes 
these sources of operating cash were partially offset by a decrease of  in accrued liabilities primarily due to the termination of the deferred compensation plan 
in  our negative operating cash flow of million resulted from a net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges including goodwill impairment of million related to goodwill recorded as a result of the v acquisition  a million write down of marketable securities related to the decline in market value of tower shares  depreciation and amortization of million  a reserve for excess inventory and inventory cost in excess of net realizable value of million  a million write off of r d assets acquired from v  and  of amortization of deferred compensation costs 
in addition  changes in working capital accounts provided cash of  primarily as a result of lower inventories of million due to selling inventory purchased under firm commitments in  lower other assets of  partially offset by higher accounts receivable of million due to higher fourth quarter revenue as compared to  lower accounts payable of million due to lower manufacturing purchases  and lower accrued liabilities of  net cash from investing activities in  investing activities used cash of million resulting from capital expenditures that were primarily for software and equipment to develop and produce our new products 
in  investing activities provided cash of  we received million from the sale of  tower shares and spent million for capital expenditures 
the capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment to develop and produce our new products 
in  investing activities used cash of million 
we invested million in tower under the terms of our agreements and we used million for capital expenditures 
the capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment to develop and produce our products 
net cash from financing activities in  cash used for financing activities was  the primary use of these funds was to reduce our long term and revolving debt  net of new borrowings by million 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock purchase program and upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
in  cash provided from financing activities was million 
the primary source of these funds was the reclassification of million of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents based upon the terms of the amended and restated silicon valley bank credit facility 
in addition  we received million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock purchase program and upon the exercise of stock options by employees  and we used million to reduce our long term and revolving debt  net of new borrowings 
in  cash provided from financing activities was million 
our positive cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to a million increase in long term and revolving debt  net of debt repayments  and million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock purchase program and upon the exercise of stock options by employees  partially offset by million of cash and cash equivalents reclassified to restricted cash under the terms of our june credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance our operating losses  the acquisition of property and equipment  working capital and the repayment of debt 
our future liquidity will depend on many factors such as these  as well as our level of revenue and gross profit  market acceptance of our existing and new products  the expected decline in revenue from our pasic and pasic product families  wafer purchase commitments  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of new product introductions  production volumes  the quality of our products  sales and marketing efforts  changes in operating assets and liabilities  our ability to obtain debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of our credit facilities  our ability to raise funds from the sale of tower shares and equity in the company  the exercise of employee stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics 
however  we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund any operating losses  capital expenditures of up to million  and provide adequate working capital for the next months 
as our liquidity is affected by many factors as mentioned above and as discussed in our risk factors  there can be no assurance that we will not seek additional capital during the next twelve months or that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
after the next months  our capital and operating requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenue and gross profit  the market acceptance of our new products  the end of life period for our pasic and pasic product families  the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  new product development efforts  capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years and years and after years contractual cash obligations operating leases wafer purchases other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments revolving line of credit notes payable to bank capital lease obligations adverse purchase commitment total commercial commitments total contractual obligations and commercial commitments certain of our wafer manufacturers require us to forecast wafer starts several months in advance 
we are committed to take delivery of and pay for a portion of forecasted wafer volume 
wafer purchase commitments of million include both firm purchase commitments and a portion of our forecasted wafer starts as of december  other commercial commitments are included as liabilities on our balance sheets as of december  inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet partnerships  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on december   fasb  issued sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for information related to the pro forma effects on our reported net loss and net loss per share of applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas r and expect the impact upon adoption in the third fiscal quarter of to be significant to our results of operations 
risk factors we may be unable to accurately estimate quarterly revenue  which could adversely affect the trading price of our stock we offer our customers a short delivery lead time and a majority of our shipments during a quarter are ordered by the customer in that quarter 
as a result  we often have low visibility to the current quarter s revenue  and our revenue levels can change significantly in a short period of time 
furthermore  our ability to respond to increased demand is limited to inventory on hand or on order and the capacity available at our contract manufacturers 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is deferred until our distributors ship our products to end customers 
therefore  we are highly dependent on the accuracy and timeliness of resale and inventory reports from our distributors 
inaccurate distributor resale or inventory reports as well as unanticipated changes in distributor inventory levels  could contribute to our difficulty in predicting and reporting our quarterly revenue and results of operations 
if we fail to accurately estimate customer demand  record revenue  or if our available capacity is less than needed to meet customer demand  our results of operations could be harmed and our stock price could materially fluctuate 
the announced end of life of our pasic and pasic product families may result in fluctuations or a decline in our revenue our foundry agreement with the supplier that fabricates our pasic and pasic product families expires at the end of we have announced an end of life for these products and have asked our customers to take delivery of lifetime buy orders before the end of while we may have limited capacity beyond  we expect to experience a significant reduction in pasic and pasic revenue near the end of we currently expect that these products will contribute less than of our revenue by the first quarter of revenue from these products was million  million  million and million in the quarters ended december  september  june and march   respectively 
we currently expect that a majority of our customers that use pasic and pasic products will purchase enough product to satisfy demand throughout the expected life of their products rather than migrate to other quicklogic products 
as a result  we could experience fluctuations in demand as these customers build inventory of these products  design systems using devices supplied by others or reduce purchases of our products 
if we are unable to migrate customers to other products  develop customer demand for our eclipse ii  quickpci ii and quickmips product families  which have strong customer design in activity but have not contributed significant revenue to date  increase revenue and gross profit from our other products  or obtain adequate production capacity  our revenue and gross profit may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 
if we fail to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products  we may be unable to compete effectively in the future we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products 
to compete successfully  we must obtain access to advanced fabrication capacity and dedicate significant resources to specify  design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance  low power consumption  new features  reliability and or cost savings to our customers 
for example  our new eclipse ii  quickpci ii and quickmips products are produced at tower s new advanced fabrication facility 
we experience a long delay between the time when we expend these development resources and invest in related long lived assets  and the time when we begin to generate revenue  if any  from these expenditures 
if we are unable to design  produce and sell new products that meet design specifications  address customer requirements  and generate sufficient revenue and gross profit  if market demand for our products fails to materialize  or if our customers do not successfully introduce products incorporating our devices  our business will be materially harmed and we may be required to write off related inventory and long lived assets 
our future results depend on our relationship with tower we have invested approximately million in tower 
in return for our investment  we have received equity  prepaid wafer credits and committed production capacity in tower s foundry facility 
we believe that tower s long term operation of this fabrication facility depends on its ability attract sufficient customer demand  to obtain additional financing and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israeli government s investment center 
the current political uncertainty and security situation in the middle east where tower s fabrication facility is located  the cyclical nature of the market for foundry manufacturing services  the early stage of operation of tower s fabrication facility  tower s financial condition  the recent resignation of tower s chairman and ceo  or other factors may adversely impact tower s business prospects and may discourage future investments in tower from outside sources 
if tower is unable to obtain adequate financing and increase production output in a timely manner  the value of our investment in tower may decline significantly or possibly become worthless  our wafer credit from tower may decline in value or possibly become worthless  and we would have to identify and qualify a substitute supplier to manufacture our products 
this could require significant development time  cause product shipment delays  impair long lived assets  damage our liquidity and severely harm our business 
the value of our investment in tower and its corresponding wafer credits may also be adversely affected by a deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally 
if the fair value of our tower investment falls below per share for a period of time or our wafer credits are deemed to be impaired  we may record additional losses 
at december   the aggregated value of our tower investment and wafer credits recorded on our balance sheets was million 
in addition  tower solely manufactures our eclipse ii  and certain quickpci ii and quickmips products  and we have made significant purchase commitments to tower for these devices 
as these are new products being manufactured in a new facility  there are significant manufacturing and engineering risks associated with these orders 
we expect these devices to be a source of significant long term revenue 
if tower is unable to produce these devices  demand for these products does not meet our expectations or if we are unable to achieve product performance or cost targets  our revenue  gross margin  research and development expenses and liquidity will be affected and we may record additional losses against inventory  purchase commitments and long lived assets 
we depend upon third parties to fabricate  assemble  test and program our products  and they may discontinue manufacturing our products  fail to give our products priority  be unable to successfully manufacture our products to meet performance  volume or cost targets  or inaccurately report inventory to us we contract with third parties to fabricate  assemble  test and program our devices 
our devices are generally fabricated and assembled by single suppliers  and the loss of a supplier  expiration of a supply agreement or the inability of our suppliers to manufacture our products to meet volume  performance and cost targets could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for instance  a single supplier fabricates our pasic and pasic product families under an agreement that expires in december while we may be able to purchase wafers after  we do not have a firm capacity commitment from the supplier 
if for any reason this or any other supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our products to our customers could be severely impaired 
we would have to identify and qualify substitute suppliers  which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operational problems  or we could announce an end of life program for these products 
alternate suppliers might not be available to fabricate  assemble  test and program our devices or  if available  might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms 
in addition  if competition for capacity increases  or if we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing technology  we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to these services  which could adversely impact our operating results and liquidity 
the number of companies that provide these services is limited and some of them have limited operating histories and financial resources 
in the event our current suppliers refuse or are unable to continue to provide these services to us  we may be unable to procure services from alternate suppliers in a timely manner  if at all 
furthermore  if customer demand for our products increases  we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers subjects us to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
this lack of control may cause unforeseen product shortages or may increase our cost to manufacture  assemble or test our products  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we record a majority of our inventory transactions based on information from our subcontractors 
if we do not receive prompt and accurate information from our vendors  we could misstate inventory levels  incorrectly record gross profit  be unable to meet our delivery commitments to customers or commit to manufacturing inventory that is not required to meet customer delivery commitments  which could materially harm our business 
fluctuations in our manufacturing processes and product yields and quality  especially for new products  may increase our costs difficulties encountered during the complex semiconductor manufacturing process can render a substantial percentage of semiconductor wafers nonfunctional  and manufacturing fluctuations may change the performance distribution of manufactured products 
we have  in the recent past  experienced manufacturing runs that have contained substantially reduced or no functioning devices  or that generated devices with below normal performance 
in addition  yield problems may take a significant period of time to analyze and correct 
our reliance on third party suppliers may extend the period of time required to analyze and correct these problems 
as a result  we may incur substantially higher manufacturing costs and inventory shortages 
yield fluctuations frequently occur in connection with the manufacture of newly introduced products  with manufacturing at new facilities or on new manufacturing processes 
newly introduced products and products that incorporate new intellectual property  such as our quickmips  quickpci ii and eclipse ii products  are often more complex and more difficult to produce  increasing the risk of manufacturing related defects 
new manufacturing facilities or processes  such as at tower  are often more complex and take a period of time to achieve expected quality levels and product costs 
while we test our products  they may still contain errors or defects that are found after we have commenced commercial production  that occur due to manufacturing variations or as new intellectual property is incorporated into our products 
if our products contain undetected or unresolved defects  we may lose market share  experience delays in or loss of market acceptance  reserve or scrap inventory  or be required to issue a product recall 
in addition  we would be at risk of product liability litigation if defects in our products are discovered 
although we attempt to limit our liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions  we cannot assure you that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
we have significant customers and limited visibility into the long term demand for our products from these customers a few of our end customers can represent a significant portion of our total revenue in a given reporting period 
as in the past  future demand from these customers may fluctuate significantly 
these customers typically order products with short requested delivery lead times  and do not provide a firm commitment to purchase product past the period covered by purchase orders 
in addition  our manufacturing lead times are longer than the delivery lead times requested by these customers  and we make significant inventory purchases in anticipation of future demand 
for example  a chinese customer  purchasing product through a distributor  represented of our total revenue in  but only of revenue in if revenue from any significant customer were to decline substantially  we may be unable to offset this decline with increased revenue from other customers and we may purchase excess inventory 
these factors could severely harm our business 
in addition  we may have made a significant investment in long lived assets for the production of our products based upon historical and expected demand 
if demand for or gross margin generated from our products does not meet our expectations  we may be required to write off inventory or incur charges against long lived assets  which would materially harm our business 
we will be unable to compete effectively if we fail to anticipate product opportunities based upon emerging technologies and standards and fail to develop products that incorporate these technologies and standards we may spend significant time and money to design and develop products around an industry standard or emerging technology 
to date  we have introduced product families  such as quickpci and quickmips  that are designed to support a specific industry standard 
additionally  customers may shift their demand to environmentally friendly products  such as products manufactured with lead free assembly components  that we have not developed 
if an industry standard or emerging technology that we have targeted fails to achieve broad market acceptance  or if we are unable to bring the technology to market in a timely manner  we may be unable to generate significant revenue from our research and development efforts 
as a result  our business would be materially harmed and we may be required to write off related inventory and long lived assets 
we have the capability and capacity to design and develop only a limited number of products that support specific industry standards 
if systems manufacturers move away from the use of industry standards that we support with our products and adopt alternative standards  we may be unable to design and develop new products that conform to these new standards 
typically  the expertise required is unique to each industry standard  and we would likely have to either hire individuals with the required expertise or acquire such expertise through a licensing arrangement 
the demand for individuals with the necessary expertise to develop a product relating to a particular industry standard is generally high  and we may not be able to hire such individuals 
the cost to acquire such expertise through licensing or other means may be high and such arrangements may not be possible in a timely manner  if at all 
we may not have the liquidity to support our future capital requirements our cash balance at december  was million 
at december   our interest bearing debt consisted of million outstanding from silicon valley bank and  outstanding under a capital lease 
at december   we had approximately million available to borrow under our revolving credit facility  approximately million available to borrow under our equipment line of credit  and we had  available for sale tower ordinary shares worth approximately million based upon the market closing price of per share at the end of our reporting period 
our ability to obtain competitive pricing from tower is tied to our ownership of at least  of these tower shares 
capital expenditures  which are largely driven by the introduction and initial manufacturing of new products  could be up to million in the next twelve months 
as a result of these potential investments  as well as research and development  selling  marketing and administrative expenses  changes in working capital and interest and debt payments  we will need to generate higher revenue and gross profit  especially from our eclipse ii and quickpci ii products  to maintain positive cash flow 
whether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  we may borrow additional funds or sell debt or equity securities  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for our operations 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  our financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected and we may not be able to operate our business without significant changes in our operations  or at all 
we have a history of losses and cannot assure you that we will return to profitability we incurred significant losses in  and our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
we may not be profitable in any future periods 
our recent revenue growth and our profitability in certain years prior to cannot be relied on as any indication of the company s future operating results or prospects 
if we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products  we may incur product shortages or excess product inventory our agreements with third party manufacturers require us to provide forecasts of our anticipated manufacturing orders  and place binding manufacturing commitments in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers 
this may result in product shortages or excess product inventory because we are limited in our ability to increase or decrease our forecasts under such agreements 
obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly  or not possible  especially in the short term since most of our products have only a single fabrication and assembly source 
our failure to adequately forecast demand for our products could materially harm our business 
we depend upon third party distributors to market and sell our products  and they may discontinue sale of our products  fail to give our products priority or be unable to successfully market  sell and support our products we contract with third party distributors to market and sell a significant portion of our products 
we typically have only a few distributors serving each geographic market  and  in the future  we may have a single distributor covering a geographic market 
although we have contracts with our distributors  our agreements with them may be terminated on short notice by either party and  if terminated  we may be unable to recruit additional or replacement distributors 
as a result  our future performance will depend in part on our ability to retain our existing distributors and attract new distributors that will be able to effectively market  sell and support our products 
the loss of one or more of our principal distributors  or our inability to attract new distributors  could materially harm our business 
many of our distributors  including our principal distributors  market and sell products for other companies  and many of these products may compete directly or indirectly with our products 
we generally are not one of the principal suppliers of products to our distributors 
if our distributors give higher priority or greater attention to the products of other companies  including products that compete with our products  our business would be materially harmed 
individual distributors and oem customers often represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable 
if we are unable to collect funds due from these distributors and customers  our financial results may be materially harmed 
our future operating results are likely to fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline our operating results have varied widely in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in addition  our past operating results may not be an indicator of future operating results 
our future operating results will depend on many factors and may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons  including those set forth in these risk factors 
any failure to meet expectations could cause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or decline 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include a significant change in sales to our largest customers  successful development and market acceptance of our products  our ability to accurately forecast product volumes and mix  and to respond to rapid changes in customer demand  the effect of end of life programs  changes in product mix or production variances that affect gross profit  our ability to adjust our fixed and manufacturing capacity and costs in response to economic and competitive pressures  our reliance on subcontract manufacturers for product capacity  yield and quality  our competitors product portfolio and product pricing policies  timely implementation of efficient manufacturing technologies  changes in accounting and corporate governance rules  impact of export and import laws and regulations  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and general economic  market  political and social conditions in the countries where we sell our products and the related effect on our customers  distributors and suppliers  and our ability to obtain capital  debt financing and insurance on commercially reasonable terms 
although certain of these factors are out of our immediate control  unless we can anticipate and be prepared with contingency plans that respond to these factors  we will be unsuccessful in carrying out our business plan 
our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial time and resources in the design of their products if one of our potential customers cancels  reduces or delays product orders from us or chooses not to release a system that incorporates our products after we have spent substantial time and resources in assisting them with their product design  our business could be materially harmed 
our customers often evaluate our products for six months or more before designing them into their systems  and they may not commence volume shipments for up to an additional six to twelve months  if at all 
during this lengthy sales cycle  our potential customers may also cancel or change their product plans 
even when customers incorporate one or more of our products into their systems  they may discontinue production 
customers whose products achieve high volume production may choose to replace our products with lower cost semiconductors 
we may encounter periods of industry wide semiconductor oversupply  resulting in pricing pressure  as well as undersupply  resulting in a risk that we could be unable to fulfill our customers requirements the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for  and supply of  its products 
these fluctuations have resulted in circumstances when supply and demand for semiconductors have been widely out of balance 
an industry wide semiconductor oversupply could result in severe downward pricing pressure from customers 
in a market with undersupply of manufacturing capacity  we would have to compete with larger foundry customers for limited manufacturing resources 
in such an environment  we may be unable to have our products manufactured in a timely manner  at a cost that generates adequate gross profit  or in sufficient quantities 
since we outsource all of our manufacturing and have only a single source of wafer supply  test and assembly for most of our products  we are particularly vulnerable to such supply shortages and capacity limitations 
as a result  we may be unable to fulfill orders and may lose customers 
any future industry wide oversupply or undersupply of semiconductors could materially harm our business 
customers may cancel or defer significant purchase orders or our distributors may return our products  which would cause our inventory levels to increase and our revenue to decline our distributors or customers may cancel purchase orders at any time with little or no penalty 
contractually  our distributors are generally permitted to return un programmed products worth up to  by value  of the products they purchase from us 
if our distributors or customers cancel or defer significant purchase orders or return our products  our accounts receivable collections would decrease and inventories would increase  which would materially harm our business 
problems associated with international business operations could affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products most of our products are manufactured outside of the united states at manufacturing facilities operated by our suppliers in taiwan  south korea  the philippines  israel and malaysia 
we expect to manufacture a majority of the products that we currently have under development in israel and to assemble these products in south korea  the philippines or malaysia 
as a result  these manufacturing operations and new product introductions are subject to risks of political instability  including the risk of conflict between taiwan and the people s republic of china  between south korea and north korea  and conflicts involving israel or malaysia 
a significant portion of our total revenue comes from sales to customers located outside the united states 
we anticipate that sales to customers located outside the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in future periods 
in addition  most of our domestic customers sell their products outside of north america  thereby indirectly exposing us to risks associated with foreign commerce and economic instability 
in addition to overseas sales offices  we have significant research and development activities in canada and india 
accordingly  our operations and revenue are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce  including the following managing foreign distributors  staffing and managing foreign offices  political and economic instability  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in tax laws  import and export regulations  tariffs and freight rates  timing and availability of export licenses  supplying products that meet local environmental regulations  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights  and obtaining governmental approvals for certain products 
in the past  we have denominated sales of our products to foreign countries exclusively in us dollars 
as a result  any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of a foreign country will increase the price of our products in that country so that our products become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of that foreign country 
as a result  sales of our products in that foreign country may decline 
to the extent any such risks materialize  our business could be materially harmed 
in addition  we incur costs in foreign countries that may be difficult to reduce quickly because of employee related laws and practices in those foreign countries 
many systems manufacturers may be unwilling to switch to our products because of their familiarity with the products offered by our direct competitors  such as xilinx and altera  which dominate the programmable logic market the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by erosion of selling prices over product lives  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and strong domestic and foreign competition 
if we are not able to compete successfully in this environment  our business will be materially harmed 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution  name recognition and other resources than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of system applications 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including  but not limited to  re programmability and lower price 
our current direct competitors include suppliers of complex programmable logic devices and field programmable gate arrays  such as xilinx  inc  altera corporation  actel corporation  and lattice semiconductor corporation 
xilinx and altera together have a majority share of the programmable logic market 
many systems manufacturers may be unwilling or unable to switch to our products due to their familiarity with competitors products or other inhibiting factors 
we also face competition from companies that offer asics  which may be purchased for a lower price at higher volumes and typically have greater logic capacity  additional features and higher performance than those of our products 
we may also face competition from suppliers of embedded microprocessors  such as freescale semiconductor  inc formerly motorola  or from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
our inability to successfully compete in any of the following areas could materially harm our business the development of new products and advanced manufacturing technologies  the quality  performance characteristics  price and availability of devices  programming hardware and software development tools  the ability to engage with companies that provide synergistic products and services  the incorporation of industry standards in our products  the diversity of product lines  or the quality and cost effectiveness of design  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
we may be unable to successfully grow our business if we fail to compete effectively with others to attract and retain key personnel we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly competent personnel 
our employees are at will and not subject to employment contracts 
hiring and retaining qualified sales and technical personnel is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees is intense 
in addition  new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified senior management  sales and technical personnel 
failure to attract  hire  train and retain personnel  could materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and may face significant expenses as a result of future litigation protection of intellectual property rights is crucial to our business  since that is how we keep others from copying the innovations that are central to our existing and future products 
from time to time  we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to license other parties patents 
we evaluate these requests on a case by case basis 
these situations may lead to litigation if we reject the offer to obtain the license 
we have in the past and are currently involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others patents or other intellectual property rights 
this kind of litigation is expensive and consumes large amounts of management s time and attention 
additionally  matters that we initially consider not material to our business could become costly 
for example  we incurred substantial costs associated with the litigation and settlement of our dispute with actel  which materially harmed our business 
in addition  if the letters we sometimes receive alleging patent infringement or other similar matters result in litigation that we lose  a court could order us to pay substantial damages and or royalties  and prohibit us from making  using  selling or importing essential technologies 
for these and other reasons  this kind of litigation could materially harm our business 
also  although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us  we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
we have entered into technology license agreements with third parties which give those parties the right to use patents and other technology developed by us  and which give us the right to use patents and other technology developed by them 
we anticipate that we will continue to enter into these kinds of licensing arrangements in the future  however  it is possible that desirable licenses will not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
if we lose existing licenses to key technology  or are unable to enter into new licenses that we deem important  it could materially harm our business 
because it is critical to our success that we continue to prevent competitors from copying our innovations  we intend to continue to seek patent and trade secret protection for our products 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that  even if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third parties 
however  employees may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in any case  others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we may engage in manufacturing  distribution or technology agreements that involve numerous risks  including the use of cash  diversion of resources and significant write offs we have entered into and  in the future  intend to enter into agreements that have involved numerous risks  including the use of significant amounts of our cash  diversion from other development projects or market opportunities  our ability to incorporate licensed technology in our products  our ability to introduce related products in a cost effective and timely manner  our ability to collect amounts due under these contracts  and market acceptance of related products 
for instance  we have licensed certain microprocessor technology from mips technologies and obtained other elements of our products from other third party companies 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the expected revenue and gross profit from the products incorporating the third party elements would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the third party elements and other long lived assets  and we recorded a million long lived asset impairment charge 
if we fail to recover the cost of these or other assets from the cash flow generated by the related products  our assets will become impaired and our financial results would be harmed 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes  other catastrophic events and business interruptions for which we only maintain limited insurance our operations and the operations of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  flood  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events beyond our control 
in particular  our headquarters is located near earthquake fault lines in the san francisco bay area 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers to manufacture our products and would not be able to qualify an alternate supplier of our products for several quarters 
our suppliers often hold significant quantities of our inventory which  in the event of a disaster  could be destroyed 
in addition  our business processes and systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  the failure of our computer systems  war or acts of terrorism  could significantly impair our ability to maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or design  manufacture or ship our products 
the occurrence of any of these events could also affect our customers  distributors and suppliers and produce similar disruptive effects upon their business 
if there is an earthquake or other catastrophic event near our headquarters  our customers facilities  our distributors facilities or our suppliers facilities  our business could be seriously harmed 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not maintain sufficient business interruption and other insurance policies to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of a catastrophic event or other significant uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may vote for actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to significantly influence our operations  affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
our shareholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover that is beneficial to stockholders our shareholder rights plan as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and could lead to securities litigation stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future  we may be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse revenue fluctuations  affect our reported results of operations or how we conduct our business fasb has issued statement r  share based payment  which will require us to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  as currently constructed at fair value and take a compensation charge equal to that value 
if this accounting pronouncement had been in effect during the current period  we estimate that we would have reported a significantly higher net loss 
new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
any future changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may have a significant effect on how we report our results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
this change to existing rules  future changes  if any  or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and the nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from profit generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal control systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we performed the system and process evaluation and testing required in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section as a result  we have incurred additional expenses and a diversion of management s time 
while we believe that our internal control procedures are adequate and we intend to continue to fully comply with the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section  we cannot be certain as to the outcome of future evaluations  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations 
if we are not able to remain in compliance with the requirements of section  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq national market 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
we have implemented import and export control procedures to comply with united states regulations but we are still exposed to potential risks from import and export activity our products  technology and software are subject to us import and export control laws and regulations which  in some instances  may impose restrictions on business activities  or otherwise require licenses or other authorizations from agencies such as the us department of state  us department of commerce and us department of the treasury 
we have import and export licensing and compliance procedures in place for purposes of conducting our business consistent with us laws and regulations  and we periodically review these procedures to maintain compliance with the requirements relating to import and export regulations 
if we are not able to remain in compliance with import and export regulations  we might be subject to investigation  sanctions or penalties by regulatory authorities 
such penalties can include civil  criminal or administrative remedies such as loss of export privileges 
we cannot be certain as to the outcome of an evaluation  investigation  inquiry or other action or the impact of these items on our operations 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we are adverse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of investments that meet high credit quality standards 
since these securities are subject to interest rate risk  they could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not anticipate any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk all of our sales and cost of manufacturing are transacted in us dollars 
since  we have conducted a portion of our research and development activities in canada and india 
we also have sales and marketing activities outside the united states 
most of these costs are incurred in local currency 
if these local currencies strengthen against the dollar  our payroll and other local expenses will be higher than we currently anticipate 
since our sales are transacted in us dollars  this negative impact on expenses would not be offset by any positive effect on revenue 
operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of total operating expenses in  and  respectively 
a majority of these foreign expenses were incurred in canada 
a currency exchange rate fluctuation of would have caused our operating expenses to change by approximately  in the year ended december
