item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of continuing operations executive overview company overview we are a leading regional wireless and broadband telecommunications service provider serving approximately million wireless customers and approximately  access line equivalents in markets covering approximately million net pops in the united states and the neighboring caribbean 
in the united states  we are a regional wireless service provider in small cities and rural areas in two geographic clusters covering parts of six states 
in our puerto rico based caribbean service area  which also includes operations in the dominican republic and the us virgin islands  we are a facilities based  fully integrated communications service provider offering both wireless and  in puerto rico and the dominican republic  broadband services to business and residential customers 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the results of operations presented below exclude centennial cable due to its classification as a discontinued operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
please see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of management s summary our vision is to be the premier regional provider of telecommunications services  by tailoring the ultimate customer experience in the markets we serve 
we deliver our tailored approach to serving local markets through our local scale and knowledge which has led to a strong track record of success 
in the united states  we provide digital wireless service in two geographic clusters  covering approximately million net pops 
our midwest cluster includes parts of indiana  michigan and ohio  and our southeast cluster includes parts of louisiana  mississippi and texas 
our clusters are comprised of small cities and rural areas 
in the caribbean region  we offer wireless and wireline services in puerto rico and the dominican republic and wireless services in the us virgin islands 
for the fiscal year ended may   we derived approximately of our caribbean operations revenue from our puerto rico operations 
puerto rico is a us dollar denominated and fcc regulated commonwealth of the united states 
san juan  the capital of puerto rico  is currently one of the largest us wireless market in terms of population 
the business strategy we use to tailor the ultimate customer experience entails focusing on attractive and growing markets and customizing our sales  marketing and customer support functions to customer needs in these markets 
for the fiscal year ended may   approximately of our wireless sales in the united states and puerto rico and substantially all of our broadband sales were made through our own employees  which allows us to have a high degree of control over the customer experience 
we use this control to deliver an experience that we believe is unique and valued by the customers in our various markets 
further  through our tailored approach  we target high quality high arpu postpaid wireless customers in our us and puerto rico operations 
our business strategy also entails ensuring that our networks are of the highest quality in all our locations 
in fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures 
this included million in our us wireless operations to upgrade and expand the coverage areas of our cell sites  and the call switching equipment of existing wireless properties  to deploy our gsm gprs network in each of our cell sites in our southeast cluster and to build out our newly acquired spectrum in grand rapids and lansing michigan 
we spent million and million on capital expenditures in our caribbean wireless and broadband 
table of contents operations  respectively  in fiscal  which included million of capitalized phones in puerto rico we loan to our customers 
these investments were to add capacity and services  to continue the development and expansion of our caribbean wireless systems  to replace and upgrade our puerto rico wireless and us virgin islands wireless network and to continue the expansion of our caribbean broadband network infrastructure 
we believe that the success of our business is a function of our performance relative to a number of key drivers 
the drivers can be summarized in our ability to attract and retain customers by profitably providing superior service at competitive rates 
we continually monitor our performance against these key drivers by evaluating several metrics 
in addition to adjusted operating income adjusted operating income represents the profitability measure of our segments see note to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliation to the appropriate generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap measure  the following key metrics  among other factors  are monitored by management in assessing the performance of our business gross postpaid and prepaid wireless additions net gain loss wireless subscribers revenue per average wireless customer including roaming revenue  or arpu roaming revenue penetration total wireless postpaid churn wireless prepaid churn caribbean wireless average monthly minutes of use per wireless customer fiber route miles caribbean broadband switched access lines caribbean broadband dedicated access line equivalents caribbean broadband on net buildings caribbean broadband capital expenditures gross postpaid and prepaid wireless additions represent the number of new subscribers we are able to add during the period 
growing our subscriber base by adding new subscribers is a fundamental element of our long term growth strategy 
we must maintain a competitive offering of products and services to sustain our subscriber growth 
we focus on postpaid customers in our us and puerto rico operations and prepaid in the dominican republic 
net gain loss wireless subscribers represents the number of subscribers we were able to add to our service during the period after deducting the number of disconnected or terminated subscribers 
by monitoring our growth against our forecast  we believe we are better able to anticipate our future operating performance 
revenue per average wireless customer including roaming revenue  or arpu  represents the average monthly subscriber revenue generated by a typical subscriber determined as subscriber revenues divided by average number of subscribers 
we monitor trends in arpu to ensure that our rate plans and promotional offerings are attractive to customers and profitable 
the majority of our revenues are derived from subscriber revenues 
subscriber revenues include  among other things monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of plan minutes  universal service fund  or usf support payment revenues  long distance revenues derived from calls placed by our customers  international interconnect revenues  roaming revenue  and other charges such as activation  voice mail  call waiting  call forwarding and regulatory charges 
roaming revenues represent the amount of revenue we receive from other wireless carriers for providing service to their subscribers who roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer is established by an agreement between the roamer s wireless provider and us 

table of contents the amount of roaming revenue we generate is often dependent upon usage patterns of our roaming partners subscribers and the rate plan mix and technology mix of our roaming partners 
we closely monitor trends in roaming revenues because usage patterns by our roaming partners subscribers can be difficult to predict 
penetration total wireless represents a percentage  which is calculated by dividing the number of our subscribers by the total population of potential subscribers available in the markets that we serve 
postpaid and prepaid churn represent the number of subscribers that disconnect or are terminated from our service or where there is a lack of usage by prepaid customers for a prescribed period of time 
churn is calculated by dividing the aggregate number of wireless subscribers who cancel service during each month in a period by the total number of wireless subscribers as of the beginning of the month 
churn is stated as the average monthly churn rate for the applicable period 
we monitor and seek to control churn so that we can grow our business without incurring significant sales and marketing cost needed to replace disconnected subscribers 
we must continue to ensure that we offer excellent network quality and customer service so that our churn rates remain low 
average monthly minutes of use per wireless customer represents the average number of minutes mou s used by our customers during a period 
we monitor growth in mou s to ensure that the access and overage charges we are collecting are consistent with that growth 
in addition  growth in subscriber usage may indicate a need to invest in additional network capacity 
fiber route miles are the number of miles of fiber cable that we have laid 
fiber is installed to connect our equipment to our customer premises equipment 
as a facilities based carrier  the number of fiber route miles is an indicator of the strength of our network  our coverage and our potential market opportunity 
switched access lines represent the amount of lines connected to our switching center and serving customers for incoming and outgoing calls 
growing our switched access lines is a fundamental element of our strategy 
we monitor the trends in our switched access line growth against our forecast to be able to anticipate future operating performance 
in addition  this measurement allows us to compute our current market penetration in the markets we serve 
dedicated access line equivalents represents the amount of voice grade equivalent  or vge lines used to connect two end points 
we monitor the trends in our dedicated service using vge against our forecast to anticipate future operating performance  network capacity requirements and overall growth of our business 
on net buildings is a location where we have established a point of presence to serve one or more customers 
tracking the number of on net buildings allows us to size our addressable market and determine the appropriate level of capital expenditures 
as a facilities based clec  it is a critical performance measurement of our growth and a clear indication of our increased footprint 
capital expenditures represent the amount spent on upgrades  additions and improvements to our telecommunications network and back office infrastructure 
we monitor our capital expenditures as part of our overall financing plan and to ensure that we receive an appropriate rate of return on our capital investments 
this statistic is also used to ensure that capital investments are in line with network usage trends and consistent with our objective of offering a high quality network to our customers 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  which result from our customers not making required payments 
we base our allowance on the likelihood of recoverability of our subscriber accounts receivable based on past experience and by reviewing current collection trends 
a worsening of economic or industry trends beyond our estimates could result in an increase of our allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
property  plant and equipment depreciation the telecommunications industry is capital intensive 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment constitutes a substantial operating cost for us 
the cost of our property  plant and equipment  principally telecommunications equipment  is charged to depreciation expense over estimated useful lives 
we depreciate our telecommunications equipment using the straight line method over its estimated useful lives 
we periodically review changes in our technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity and salvage values to determine adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
actual economic lives may differ from our estimated useful lives as a result of changes in technology  market conditions and other factors 
such changes could result in a change in our depreciable lives and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in our estimation of fair value  we consider current market values of properties similar to our own  competition  prevailing economic conditions  government policy  including taxation  and the historical and current growth patterns of both our business and the industry 
we also consider the recoverability of the cost of our long lived assets based on a comparison of estimated undiscounted operating cash flows for the related businesses with the carrying value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate the fair value of and impairment  if any  of our assets 
these estimates are very subjective in nature  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
estimates related to recoverability of assets are critical accounting policies as management must make assumptions about future revenue and related expenses over the life of an asset  and the effect of recognizing impairment could be material to our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
actual revenue and costs could vary significantly from such estimates 
goodwill and wireless licenses valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and wireless licenses for impairment based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of january st or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we have determined that our reporting units for sfas are our operating segments determined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use 
table of contents projections of future cash flows from each reporting unit to determine whether its estimated value exceeds its carrying value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  time horizons of cash flow forecasts  assumed terminal value  estimates of our future cost structures and anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
these projections are very subjective in nature 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model eg  growth rates  future economic conditions or discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of the reporting unit are subjective and could result in different values and may affect any related goodwill or wireless licenses impairment charge 
we performed our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis during the fiscal year ended may  based on the analysis performed in accordance with sfas  we recorded no impairment charge during fiscal year ended may  compared to year ended may  results of operations we had approximately  wireless subscribers  including approximately  wholesale subscribers  at may   as compared to approximately  including approximately  wholesale subscribers  at may   an increase of

revenue 
us wireless service revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the fiscal year ended may  the increase in us wireless service revenue was primarily due to increased arpu 
contributing to the increase in arpu during the fiscal year ended may  was an increase of million of usf revenue  which included million for prior fiscal years for which the amount did not become known and realizability was not probable until receipt of an fcc order in the first quarter of fiscal us wireless roaming revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may  the increase was primarily due to an increase in gsm roaming minutes as a result of our launch of gsm service  partially offset by lower average roaming rates per minute 
we expect roaming revenue to decline over the long term and anticipate that roaming revenues will remain a small percentage of consolidated revenues in future periods 
our us wireless operations had approximately  and  subscribers at may  and may   respectively  which included  and  respectively  of wholesale subscribers 
wholesale subscribers are customers who use our network and services but are billed by a third party reseller who has effectively resold our services to the end user customer

costs and expenses 
cost of services increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to an i increase in incollect roaming cost costs associated with providing our subscribers roaming on other carriers networks which was driven by higher incollect minutes of use partially offset by lower incollect roaming rates  ii increase in external and internal maintenance costs related to our wireless gsm gprs network and iii increase in telephone service costs due to higher minutes of use 
average incollect roaming costs per subscriber were per month for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to per month for the same period a year ago 
these increases were partially offset by reimbursements received for our costs in deploying basic and enhanced services  or e  which we accounted for as a reduction to cost of services 
e capabilities will enable commercial mobile radio service systems to determine the location of persons making emergency calls 
cost of equipment sold increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in phones used for customer retention  partially offset by a slight decrease in average cost per phone and lower activations 
we expect this trend to continue as we migrate our customers onto our gsm gprs network 
sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year  primarily due to lower commissions as a result of lower activations 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year  primarily due to reduced legal and bad debt expenses

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  during the fiscal year ended may   we performed an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets in our caribbean broadband businesses because we determined at the time that certain undersea cable assets were to be underutilized 
we performed asset impairment tests at the reporting unit level  the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the tests were performed by comparing the aggregate undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
based on these tests  we determined that certain undersea cable assets should be considered impaired 
the undersea cable assets are a component of property  plant and equipment  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million on these assets for the fiscal year ended may   in accordance with sfas there have been no triggering events as defined under the guidance of sfas that would have required us to perform an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets during the fiscal year ended may  during the fiscal years ended may  and  we sold and telecommunications towers  respectively  to aat communications corp  or aat  for approximately million and million  respectively
