overview overall demand for our products is driven by investments in capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  industry factors that include our customers new product introductions  trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services  and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate  levels of global industrial production  and regional factors that include local political  social  regulatory and economic circumstances 
us industrial economic trends in  sales in the us accounted for more than percent of our total sales 
the trend of improving conditions experienced in the us manufacturing economy during continued into  as reflected in the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets 
these indicators include industrial equipment spending  which is an economic statistic compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea 
this statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad us industrial economy  which includes our primary customer base 
this measure  over the longer term  has proven to have reasonable predictive value  and to be a good directional indicator of our growth trend 
capacity utilization  which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the federal reserve 
historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their manufacturing base 
the purchasing managers index pmi  published by the institute for supply management ism  which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism  a pmi measure above indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below indicates that it is generally contracting 

table of contents the table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in us industrial equipment spending expressed in billions of usd  capacity utilization expressed as a percentage  and the continued expansion in manufacturing activity  as indicated by the pmi expressed as defined above since december industrial equipment capacity spending utilization in billions percent pmi fiscal september june march december fiscal september june march december fiscal september june march december note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 
non us regional trends outside the us  demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets 
these customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies 
recent strength in demand has  in part  been driven by investment in infrastructure in developing economies  in basic materials production capacity in response to higher end product pricing and in expanding consumer markets

industry views we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products  transportation  basic materials  and oil and gas 
during we benefited from growing demand in most of the industries we serve 

table of contents our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage  brewing  consumer packaged goods and life sciences industries 
as automation is key to their ability to differentiate their product offerings  their investment is generally less cyclical than heavy manufacturing customers 
factors such as customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales to transportation customers 
our customers in basic materials industries  including mining  aggregates  metals  forest products and cement  all benefit from higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic materials  both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries 
as energy prices rise  customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity 
in addition  higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider new investment in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies  such as intelligent motor controls 
outlook for the following is a summary of our objectives for sustain the growth of our logix platform by accelerating the proliferation and adoption of our integrated architecture features and functionality  and by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market  continue our geographic expansion and growth  particularly in emerging economies  demonstrate and expand our industry specific domain expertise and solutions capability  and drive continued cost productivity 
our outlook for assumes that the economic environment will remain favorable and that a continuing industrial recovery will result in growth during while we expect demand for our products to benefit from this trend  we also assume that our growth will vary  and may exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter 
as of the date of filing this report  based upon current economic activities and business trends  we expect to grow revenue in by to percent  excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of the date hereof  we also expect full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to  and plan to generate free cash flow of approximately million  after giving effect to our million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension trust in october

sales of our logix offering grew by more than percent compared to  which was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by logix 
growth in sales of our logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded addressable market 
our intelligent motor control products also delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extraction based and heavy industrial customers 
higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to the strong demand from these customers 
segment operating earnings increased by percent compared to the increase in segment operating earnings is due to higher volume  cost productivity and favorable pricing that was somewhat offset by inflation

control systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of asia and latin america where we continued to increase market penetration 
sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller productivity related projects 
these projects were the result of pent up demand after the period of under investment in productive assets during and in addition to these investments  we experienced an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year these larger projects were driven by our customers requirements for incremental productivity improvements and capacity optimization 
our logix platform business continued its strong growth with an increase of percent over industrial components and adjustable speed drives experienced double digit growth as well 
these gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms 
segment operating margins increased due to higher volume  favorable product mix and productivity improvements 
volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs 

table of contents power systems in millions  except percentages increase sales segment operating earnings segment operating margin pts power systems sales increased percent compared to the mechanical and electrical business groups contributed about equally to the growth 
the sales increase was mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales 
significant cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter of  financial leverage on incremental volume and price increases more than offset rising raw material prices  resulting in the improved segment operating margin

financial condition the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions year ended september  cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash cash used for provided by continuing operations the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow our definition of free cash flow  which is a non gaap financial measure  takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy 
in our opinion  free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments  service of debt principal  dividends and share repurchases 
we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies 
free cash flow was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  increased pre tax earnings more than offset the increase in voluntary contributions to our us pension plan million in compared to million in  capital spending and working capital needs 
the increased capital spending includes investments in information technology and certain long lived asset replacements 

table of contents when necessary  we utilize commercial paper as our principal source of short term financing 
at september  and  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
during we had no commercial paper borrowings and during we did not have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position 
in january  we repaid our million of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand 
in april  we repaid our million principal amount of notes at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million  compared to repurchases of approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million in we anticipate repurchasing stock in  the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions  stock price and other cash requirements 
at september  we had authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to approximately million additional shares through september  in october  we contributed million to our us qualified pension trust 
the contribution was funded with a combination of cash on hand and million of commercial paper borrowings 
in november  we sold owned properties in a sale leaseback transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
the cash proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings 
we expect future significant uses of cash to include capital expenditures  dividends to shareowners  repayments of short term borrowings  acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and may include additional contributions to our pension plans 
we expect capital expenditures in to be about million 
we expect that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances  cash generated by operating activities  commercial paper borrowings  a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have access to existing financing sources  including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at september  and percent at september  in october  we entered into a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing million unsecured credit facilities 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding 
the terms of our credit facility contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio were to exceed percent 
in addition to our million credit facility  short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately million at september  were available to foreign subsidiaries 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  short term long term credit rating agency rating outlook rating outlook standard poor s a stable a stable moody s p stable a stable fitch ratings f stable a stable moody s changed its long term outlook from negative to stable during the second quarter of to reflect our leading position in the global industrial automation market  our healthy balance sheet and solid cash flow generation 
among other things  we can draw our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility  to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper 
under our current policy with respect to these ratings  we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facility  if any  to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow  if needed  to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

table of contents if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding 
in such event  the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 
cash dividends to shareowners were million per share in and million per share in although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors  we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends in of per outstanding share 
certain of our contractual cash obligations at september  are payments by period total thereafter long term debt and interest a minimum operating lease payments b total a the amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates

supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
therefore  reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates  which are outside of our control 
we believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates 
we use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance 
we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year 
we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of origin

actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 
retirement benefits pension benefits pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  the assumed annual compensation increase rate  retirement rate  mortality rate and employee turnover rate 
changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods 
our global pension expense in was million compared to million in approximately percent of our global pension expense relates to our us qualified pension plan 
the actuarial 
table of contents assumptions used to determine our us pension expense included the following discount rate of percent compared to percent for  expected rate of return on plan assets of percent compared to percent for  and an assumed compensation increase rate of percent compared to percent for 
in  we made voluntary contributions of million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to million in we estimate our pension expense will be approximately million in  an increase of approximately million over our estimated pension expense reflects the following changes in the us pension plan the net cost related to changes in actuarial assumptions  the benefit of a million contribution in september and a million contribution in october  and the benefit related to a plan amendment that eliminates the early retirement subsidy for certain employees 
for  changes in actuarial assumptions include a basis point reduction in our discount rate to percent from the percent used in the discount rate is set as of our june th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 
our assumed rate of return on plan assets will remain at percent  consistent with we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption 
we have assumed a compensation increase rate of percent in  compared to percent used in we established this rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension eligible earnings 
additionally  in establishing our pension assumptions  we performed an actuarial experience study that changed other assumptions including retirement rate  employee turnover rate  and mortality rate as a result of utilizing the rp table projected forward years 
effective for  we amended our us pension plan to eliminate the early retirement subsidy for certain employees 
the effect of the amendment is a reduction of approximately million in our pension benefit obligation and a corresponding reduction in annual pension expense recognized over the average remaining service life of plan participants 
the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of basis points in the assumptions for our us pension plans in millions pension benefits change in change in projected benefit net periodic obligation benefit cost discount rate rate of return additional information regarding pension benefits  including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment  is contained in note in the financial statements 
other postretirement benefits we estimate  with the assistance of third party actuarial consultants  the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions  including the discount rate and  for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program  expected trends in the cost for healthcare services 
changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
the discount rate used to calculate our other postretirement benefits expense was percent compared to percent in 
table of contents 
for  the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to percent 
effective october   we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services 
as a result of this amendment to our primary us program  there is no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of january  net periodic benefit cost in was million compared to million in we expect net periodic benefit cost in of approximately million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate million 
the expected increases are primarily due to the decrease in discount rate as of our june  measurement date by basis points to percent 
additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note in the financial statements 
revenue recognition we record sales of products and services  representing approximately of our consolidated sales  when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred  as may be required according to contract terms  or services have been rendered 
we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales on construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting 
we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress towards completion is reasonably and reliably estimable  we use the completed contract method for all others 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii units of delivery 
under the percentage of completion method  we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified 
we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
returns  rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product 
we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates  account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria 
certain distributors are offered a right to return product  subject to contractual limitations 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 
a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed 
if the time period were to change by percent  the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately million 

table of contents returns  rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided 
accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or  where a right of set off exists  as a reduction of accounts receivable 
the accrual for customer returns  rebates and incentives was million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
to determine fair value  we must make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates 
we perform our annual impairment test on non amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year 
as of the second quarter of  the estimated fair value of our reliance trademark exceeded its million net book value 
we calculated the estimated fair value with the assistance of third party valuation specialists 
either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our electrical reliance business group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value 
litigation  claims and contingencies we record liabilities for litigation  claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation 
we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants 
the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party 
at third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified  we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties 
at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party  we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation 
we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value 
environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup 
to the extent that remediation procedures change  additional contamination is identified  or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected  the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 
the reserve for environmental matters  net of related receivables  was million at september  and million at september  during  we recorded adjustments totaling million to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to adjustments of million 
our recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate 
the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to 
table of contents earnings is low 
as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters  we expect that gradually  over a long period of time  our environmental obligations will decline 
however  changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 
various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business  including those pertaining to product liability 
as described in item legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago 
see item for further discussion 
our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount 
claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers 
we estimate the reserve for product liability claims  excluding asbestos  with the assistance of a third party actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods being valued 
adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims 
the reserve for product liability claims was million at september  and million at september  additional information regarding litigation  claims and contingencies is contained in note in the financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
additionally  we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
while we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns  taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions 
cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products  services  and or intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures 
we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  according to the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have recorded an accrual of million at september  that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits and is recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
a final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million at september  for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards carryforwards based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction 
the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the carryforwards that are expected to be realized 
our income would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more carryforwards than currently expected 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned as well as tax planning strategies 
current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions has resulted  and may continue to result  in an increasing effective tax rate over time 
if the actual results differ from our estimates  we may have to adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period such determination is made 

table of contents additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities  we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 
our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
at september  and  we had no commercial paper or bank borrowings outstanding 
during  we had no commercial paper borrowings 
in  the weighted average commercial paper borrowing was million 
changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations 
if market interest rates would have averaged percent higher than actual levels in either or  the effect on our results of operations would not have been significant 
in october  we issued million of unsecured commercial paper obligations with maturities of to days 
we used the proceeds of the commercial paper to partially fund a million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan trust made on october  as these obligations mature  we anticipate issuing additional short term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 
we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was million at september  and million at september  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our million aggregate principal amount of notes  payable in  to floating rate debt based on six month libor 
the floating rate was percent at september  a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
in addition  we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next four years 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars 
a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value in earnings immediately 
at september  and  we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro  swiss franc  canadian dollar  british pound sterling  and australian dollar for us dollars 
the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations
