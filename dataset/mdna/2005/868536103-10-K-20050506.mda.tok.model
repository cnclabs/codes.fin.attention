item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview supervalu is one of the largest grocery companies in the united states 
we operate within two selling businesses in the grocery food industry  grocery retail and food distribution 
at february   we conducted our retail operations through a total of  stores of which are licensed locations 
principal formats include extreme value stores  regional price superstores and regional supermarkets 
our food distribution operations 
index to financial statements network spans states and we serve as primary grocery supplier to approximately  stores  in addition to our own regional banner store network  as well as serving as secondary grocery supplier to approximately stores 
based on revenues today  we would be ranked as the largest extreme value food retailer  eighth largest grocery retailer  and largest public company food wholesaler in the united states 
the grocery food industry can be characterized as one of consolidation and rationalization 
the grocery industry also continues to experience store saturation driven primarily by increases in square footage devoted to food in supercenters  club stores  mass merchandisers  dollar stores  drug stores and other alternate formats as well as organic growth by traditional supermarket operators 
as a result  same store sales growth for the industry has been soft  pressuring profitability levels in the industry as operating costs rise at a rate faster than sales growth 
we expect this industry environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
in fiscal  we anticipate same store sales growth of approximately one percent 
the grocery industry is also affected by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer spending behavior 
we would characterize fiscal as a year with modest economic growth with relatively normal levels of consumer spending and product cost inflation 
for fiscal  we expect consumer spending to be pressured by higher fuel prices and modest food inflation 
in fiscal  most businesses  including the labor intensive grocery industry  were again impacted by another year of rising health care and pension costs 
although the rate of increase moderated in fiscal  these rising costs impacted the overall profitability levels of the food industry and have become a pivotal issue in labor negotiations for unionized employees who bargain for health and retirement benefits in addition to wages 
approximately percent of supervalu s employees are unionized 
we did not experience any strikes during fiscal approximately percent of our unionized workforce are represented by contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal all of these industry factors impact our food distribution customer base 
as a result  we continue to experience customer attrition in our food distribution operations 
the attrition rate in fiscal was approximately seven percent  which is above the historical range of approximately two percent to four percent  due primarily to three large customer transitions to other suppliers during the year 
for fiscal  we anticipate the attrition rate in this business will be in the upper end of that historical range 
all the above factors will continue to impact our industry and our company in fiscal we believe we can be successful against this industry backdrop with our regional retail formats that focus on local execution  merchandising  and consumer knowledge 
in addition  our operations will benefit from our efficient and low cost supply chain and economies of scale as we leverage our retail and distribution operations 
save a lot  our extreme value format  has nationwide potential  and currently operates in states 
in fiscal and in the future  the majority of our new extreme value food stores will be a type of combination store offering both food and general merchandise 
we plan to expand regional retail banner square footage through selective new store growth in key markets where we have significant market share 
in addition  we will supplement regional retail store growth with continued focus on remodel activities 
given the life cycle maturity of our distribution business with its inherent attrition rate  future growth in food distribution will be modest and primarily achieved through serving new independent customers  net growth from existing customers and further consolidation opportunities 
our recent acquisition of total logistics offers a new platform to participate in the fast growing logistics arena 
we remain committed to streamlining our operations and improving our return on invested capital through a variety of initiatives

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowances for losses on receivables management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts and notes receivable portfolios 
in determining the adequacy of the allowances  management analyzes the value of the collateral  customer financial 
index to financial statements statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
although risk management practices and methodologies are utilized to determine the adequacy of the allowance  it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted by different judgments as to collectibility based on the information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
lifo and retail inventory method inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is replacement value 
substantially all of the company s inventory is finished goods 
for a significant portion of the company s inventory  cost is determined through use of the last in  first out lifo method 
the company utilized lifo to value approximately percent and percent of the company s consolidated inventories for fiscal and  respectively 
the retail inventory method rim is used to value retail inventory 
the valuation of inventories is at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce results which differ from actual 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date 
reserves for closed properties and asset impairment charges the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to fifteen years 
the company estimates subtenant income and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
owned properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
reduction in the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
the expectations on timing of disposition or sublease and the estimated sales price or sublease income associated with closed properties are impacted by variable factors such as inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while 
index to financial statements management believes the current estimates on closed properties are adequate  it is possible that market conditions could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
reserves for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  health care for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  health care and general and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
a basis point change in discount rates  based on changes in market rates would increase the company s liability by approximately million 
benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other post retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect its recognized expense and obligation in future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially impact non union pension and other post retirement obligations and future expenses 
for fiscal  when not considering other changes in assumptions  the impact to pension expense of each basis point reduction in the discount rate is to increase pension expense by approximately million and the impact of each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets is to increase pension expense by approximately million 
for post retirement  a one percent increase in the health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million and the service and interest cost by million in fiscal in contrast  a one percent decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million and the service and interest cost by approximately million in fiscal the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
goodwill management assesses the valuation of goodwill for each of the company s reporting units on an annual basis through the comparison of the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by the company  which utilize a discounted cash flow methodology 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal is primarily related to changes in working capital 

index to financial statements net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal and investing activities primarily reflect capital spending to fund retail store expansion  store remodeling and technology enhancements 
fiscal activities also include the acquisition of total logistics and the proceeds from the sale of winco

these factors are in addition to any other cautionary statements  written or oral  which may be made or referred to in connection with any such forward looking statement  however  they should not be construed as exhaustive 
economic conditions 
the food industry is sensitive to a number of economic conditions such as i food price deflation or inflation  ii softness in local and national economies  iii increases in commodity prices  iv the availability of favorable credit and trade terms  and v other economic conditions that may affect consumer buying habits 
any one or more of these economic conditions can affect our retail sales  the demand for products we distribute to our retailer customers  our operating costs and other aspects of our businesses 
competition 
the industries in which we compete are extremely competitive 
both our retail food and food distribution businesses are subject to competitive practices that may affect i the prices at which we are able to sell products at our retail locations  ii sales volume  iii the ability of our distribution customers to sell products we supply  which may affect future orders  and iv our ability to attract and retain customers 
in addition  the nature and extent of consolidation in the retail food and food distribution industries could affect our competitive position or that of our distribution customers in the markets we serve 
our retail food business faces competition from other retail chains  supercenters  non traditional competitors and emerging alterative formats in the markets where we have retail operations 
in our food distributions business  our success depends in part on the ability of our independent retailer customers to compete with these same formats  our ability to attract new customers  and our ability to supply products in a cost effective manner 
declines in the level of retail sales activity of our distribution customers due to competition  consolidations of retailers or competitors  increased self distribution by our customers  or the entry of new or non traditional distribution systems into the industry may adversely affect our revenues 
security and food safety 
wartime activities  threats of terror  acts of terror or other criminal activity directed at the grocery industry  the transportation industry  or computer or communications systems  could increase security costs  adversely affect the company s operations  or impact consumer behavior and spending as well as customer orders 
other events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination or food born illness could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
labor relations and employee benefit costs 
potential work disruptions from labor disputes may affect sales at our stores as well as our ability to distribute products 
we contribute to various multi employer healthcare and pension plans covering certain union represented employees in both our retail and distribution operations 
approximately one third of the employees in our total workforce are participants in multi employer plans 
the costs of providing benefits through such plans have escalated rapidly in recent years 
based upon information available to us  we believe certain of these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the decline in the value of assets supporting these plans  in addition 
index to financial statements to the high level of benefits generally provided  has led to the underfunding 
as a result  contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges 
expansion and acquisitions 
while we intend to continue to expand our retail and distribution businesses through new store openings  new affiliations and acquisitions  expansion is subject to a number of risks  including the adequacy of our capital resources  the location of suitable store or distribution center sites and the negotiation of acceptable purchase or lease terms  and the ability to hire and train employees 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including making acquisitions at acceptable rates of return  the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and integration of personnel of the acquired business  costs and other risks associated with integrating or adapting operating systems  and potential adverse effects on our operating results 
liquidity 
we expect to continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds 
however  if our capital spending significantly exceeds anticipated capital needs  additional funding could be required from other sources including borrowing under our bank credit lines or through debt issuances 
in addition  acquisitions could affect our borrowing costs and future financial flexibility
