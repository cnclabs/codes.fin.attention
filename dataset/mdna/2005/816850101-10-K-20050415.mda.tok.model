item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
as discussed in forward looking and cautionary statements earlier in this report  this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements  including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this form k  in our other filings with the sec  and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference 
we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we design  produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer  communications and industrial markets 
our products are designed into a wide variety of end applications  including notebook and desktop computers  computer graphics  personal digital assistants pdas  cellular phones  wireline networks  wireless base stations  set top boxes and automated test equipment ate 
products within the communications market include products for local area networks  metro and wide area networks  cellular phones and base stations 
industrial applications include ate  medical devices and factory automation systems 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including apple  agilent  cisco  compal electronics  dell  hewlett packard  ibm  intel  lg electronics  motorola  quanta computer  samsung  siemens  sony and unisys 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  depreciation on fixed assets used in the manufacturing process  shipping costs  direct labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many large commercial customers include terms in their purchase orders  which provide liberal cancellation provisions 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
sales made directly to original equipment manufacturers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
we divide and operate our business based on two reportable segments standard semiconductor products and rectifier  assembly and other products 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
we do not track balance sheet items by individual reportable segments 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data below operating income 
the standard semiconductor products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management  protection  test and measurement  advanced communications and human input device product lines 
the rectifier  assembly and other products segment includes our line of assembly and rectifier devices  which are the remaining products from our founding as a supplier into the military and aerospace market 
it also includes other products made up of custom integrated circuits 

table of contents our business involves reliance on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  malaysia  the philippines and germany 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon in terms of finished wafers purchased were manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining sales were primarily to customers in europe  canada  and mexico 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and discuss with our audit committee our estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory reserves  asset impairments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting policies and estimates do not vary between our two reportable segments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  bank and corporate obligations 
temporary investments have original maturities in excess of three months  but mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
we classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity 
we included any unrealized gain or loss  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  where return privileges exist until these products are sold through to end users or the return privilege lapses 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  are recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 

table of contents inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against our inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and estimable 
any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
accounting for income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
unless a valuation allowance relates to benefits from stock option exercise activity  to the extent we change the valuation allowance in a period  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
if a valuation allowance relates to a benefit from stock option exercise activity  any adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded to paid in capital in the period of the adjustment 
management continually evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
in the current period  a tax contingency reserve of million was established to address this exposure 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements  including adoption of a specific domestic reinvestment plan for the 
table of contents repatriated funds 
on january  the us treasury published notice providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction 
based on our current understanding of the act  we believe that we may repatriate from to approximately million in dividends subject to the elective dividends received deduction generating a corresponding tax provision liability between and million 
we expect to confirm our understanding of this provision and seek the required chief executive officer and board of directors approval of the required domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe the incentive is available 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of over the million for fiscal year semiconductor and electronics industry conditions improved dramatically in the fiscal year  especially during the first half of the year 
the significant increase in sales reflected both the strength of fiscal year and the general weakness that occurred during fiscal year presented below are the estimated sales by end market 
end products in the computer end market include notebook and desktop computers  graphics applications  pdas and computer gaming systems 
communications include cellular phone handsets  wireless base stations  set top boxes  and networking  broadband and long hail communications infrastructure equipment

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was due to higher absolute sales levels in fiscal year and slightly higher gross margin on products sold 
we continue to try and develop new products that are more complex  which in turn generally provides for higher gross margin 
these margin improvements can be offset by lower average selling prices and other factors tied to industry conditions

in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we have incurred significant expenditures during the past five years 
we expect to continue these investments aimed at developing new products  including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment 
our intent is to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and investments 
a portion of our capital resources  and the related liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations  any repatriation could have negative tax implications 
purchases of new capital equipment were made to expand our test capacity and support other engineering functions  including product design and qualification 
these purchases were funded from our operating cash flows and cash reserves 
we believe that operating cash flows together with cash reserves are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of january   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
late in fiscal year  we established a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan 
we match a portion of the employee s deferral  with the match subject to a vesting period 
compensation expense under this plan totaled  in fiscal year our liability for deferred compensation totaled million as of january   and is included in other long term liabilities in the table above 
we have purchased whole life insurance on the lives of certain of the deferred compensation plan participants

recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the pronouncement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years after november  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  the results of operations or liquidity

 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure under this provision is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of this statement are scheduled to become effective for fiscal years beginning after june  assuming this new standard is implemented as scheduled  we plan to adopt this in the first quarter of fiscal year that ends on april  we are currently evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas no 
r the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method 
the exact impact of adopting this pronouncement cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on many factors  including the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted this pronouncement in prior periods  the impact of this pronouncement would approximate the impact of sfas no

economic decline may have adverse consequences for our business we sell our products into several commercial markets  primarily the computer  communication and industrial end markets  whose performance is tied to the overall economy 
many of these industries were severely impacted in calendar years and due to an economic slowdown in the united states and globally 
our business during these periods reflected the weak economic conditions 
market research analysts have claimed that historically the semiconductor industry is impacted by broad economic factors  such as united states gross domestic product gdp and worldwide oil prices 
if economic conditions were to once again worsen or a wider global slowdown were to occur  demand for our products may be reduced 
in addition  economic slowdowns may also affect our customers ability to pay for our products 
accordingly  economic slowdowns may harm our business 
the cyclical nature of the electronics and semiconductor industries may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue and profit levels during industry downturns the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns  which are characterized by reduced product demand  production overcapacity  increased levels of inventory  industry wide fluctuations in the demand for semiconductors and the significant erosion of average selling prices 
the occurrence of these conditions has adversely affected our business in the past 
in fiscal year  our net sales declined by compared to the prior year as a result of a dramatic slowdown in the industry 
past downturns in the semiconductor industry have resulted in a sudden impact on the semiconductor and capital equipment markets 
consequently  any future downturns in the semiconductor industry may harm our business 
we compete against larger  more established entities and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change  and design and other technological obsolescence 
we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
some of these competitors include texas instruments  national semiconductor  linear technology  maxim integrated products  fairchild semiconductor and intersil semiconductor  with respect to our power management products  st microelectronics nv and california micro devices  with respect to our protection products  analog devices and maxim integrated products  with respect to our test and measurement products  zarlink semiconductor and silicon laboratories  with respect to our advanced communications products  and alps electric and synaptics inc  with respect to our hid products 
we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in 
table of contents the semiconductor market 
our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving area of integrated circuit technology depends on several factors  including success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies  protection of our processes  trade secrets and know how  maintaining high product quality and reliability  pricing policies of our competitors  performance of competitors products  ability to deliver in large volume on a timely basis  marketing  manufacturing and distribution capability  and financial strength 
to the extent that our products achieve market success  competitors typically seek to offer competitive products or lower prices  which  if successful  could harm our business 
a majority of our net sales are into larger  vertical end market applications 
fluctuations and seasonality and economic downturns in any of our end markets may have adverse consequences for our business a majority of our net sales are into larger  vertical end market applications such as notebook computers  desktop computers and cellular phones 
vertical end market applications tend to be highly cyclical over time and highly competitive given the significant unit opportunities they represent 
horizontal markets tend to be less cyclical  but unit volume opportunities are much lower 
we consider the industrial market to be a horizontal end market  because it is much more broad based and comprised on many non standardized end applications 
many of our products are used in personal computers and related peripherals 
for fiscal year  we estimate of our sales were used in computer applications  including tied to notebook computers 
industry wide fluctuations in demand for desktop and notebook computers have in the past  and may in the future  harm our business 
in addition  our past results have reflected some seasonality  with demand levels being higher in computer segments during the third and fourth quarters of the year in comparison to the first and second quarters 
for fiscal year  shipment of our products to the ate customers represented approximately of our net sales 
products sold into the ate tend to have above corporate average gross margins 
consequently  downturns in the ate market and declines in the sales of our products used in ate systems may adversely affect our business 
since the middle of fiscal year  we saw demand from cellular phone manufacturers increase  and we estimate of our sales in fiscal year were tied to this end market application 
any decline in the number of cellular phones made  especially feature rich phones with color displays  could adversely affect our business 
we obtain many essential components and materials and certain critical manufacturing services from a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors  which are principally foreign based entities our reliance on a limited number of outside subcontractors and suppliers for silicon wafers  packaging  test and certain other processes involves several risks  including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over the price  timely delivery  reliability and quality of components 
these risks may be attributable to several factors  including limitation on resources  labor problems  equipment failures or the occurrence of natural disasters 
there can be no assurance that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers or subcontractors 
disruption or termination of our supply sources or subcontractors could significantly delay our shipments and harm our business 
delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
any prolonged inability to obtain timely deliveries or quality manufacturing or any other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture or package certain components internally could limit our growth and harm our business 

table of contents most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  malaysia  the philippines and germany 
for fiscal year  approximately of our silicon in terms of finished wafers  was supplied by a third party foundry in china  and this percentage could be even higher in future periods 
for fiscal year  approximately of our silicon in terms of finished wafers was supplied by this third party foundry in china 
while we do have some redundancy of fab processes by using multiple outside foundries  any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact us 
likewise  we maintain some amount of business interruption insurance to help reduce the risk of wafer supply interruption  but we are not fully insured against such risk 
a majority of our package and test operations are performed by third party contractors that are based in malaysia  the philippines and china 
our international business activities  in general  are subject to a variety of potential risks resulting from certain political and economic uncertainties 
any political turmoil or trade restrictions in these countries  particularly china  could limit our ability to obtain goods and services from these suppliers and subcontractors 
the effect of an economic crisis or a political turmoil on our suppliers located in these countries may impact our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
if we find it necessary to transition the goods and services received from our existing suppliers or subcontractors to other firms  we would likely experience an increase in production costs and a delay in production associated with such a transition  both of which could have a significant negative effect on our operating results  as these risks are substantially uninsured 
we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products required to maintain or expand our business we operate in a dynamic environment characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change and design and other technological obsolescence 
our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to achieve design wins for our products with current and future customers and introduce new or improved products that meet customer needs while achieving favorable margins 
a failure to achieve design wins  to introduce these new products in a timely manner or to achieve market acceptance for these products  could harm our business 
the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long term market demand and future technological developments  as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors  including timely and efficient completion of process design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  the quality and reliability of the product  and effective marketing  sales and service 
the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance due to these or other factors could harm our business 
our products may be found to be defective  product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have sufficient liability insurance one or more of our products may be found to be defective after shipment  requiring a product replacement  recall  or a software solution that would cure the defect but impede performance of the product 
we may also be subject to product returns which could impose substantial costs and harm our business 
product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the end products into which they are incorporated 
a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in our customer s end product  so we may face claims for damages that are disproportionately higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved  especially if our customer seeks to recover for damage claims made against it by its own customers 
while we maintain some insurance  there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage  that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance  or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

table of contents the costs associated with our general product warranty policy and our indemnification of certain customers  distributors  and other parties could be higher in future periods our general warranty policy provides for repair or replacement of defective parts 
in some cases a refund of the purchase price is offered 
in certain instances  we have agreed to other warranty terms  including some indemnification provisions  that could prove to be significantly more costly 
if there is a substantial increase in the rate of customer claims  if our estimate of probable losses relating to identified warranty exposures prove inaccurate  or our efforts to contractually limit liability prove inadequate  we may record a charge against future cost of sales 
in the normal course of our business  we indemnify other parties  including customers  distributors  and lessors  with respect to certain matters 
these obligations typically arise under contracts under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to certain matters  such as acts or omissions of our employees  infringement of third party intellectual property rights  and certain environmental matters 
we have also entered into agreements with our directors and some of our executives indemnifying them against certain liabilities incurred in connection with their duties  and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations with respect to our directors and employees 
in some cases there are limits on and exceptions to our potential indemnification liability 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
over at least the last decade  we have not incurred any significant expense as a result of agreements of this type 
accordingly  we have not accrued any amounts for such indemnification obligations 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not incur expense under these indemnification provisions in the future 
our share price could be subject to extreme price fluctuations  and shareholders could have difficulty trading shares the market for the stock of high technology companies has been volatile  and the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
fluctuations could be in response to items such as operating results  announcements of technological innovations  or market conditions for technology stocks in general 
additionally  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies 
these market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions  may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the company s stock price 
this type of litigation  if filed against us  could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
in addition  the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by us or by our existing stockholders may have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares of common stock 
there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will remain at or near its current level 
we sell and trade with foreign customers  which subjects our business to increased risks applicable to international sales sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately of net sales in the fiscal year ended january  sales to our customers located in taiwan and korea constituted and  respectively  of net sales for fiscal year international sales are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
these factors may harm our business 
our use of the semtech name may be prohibited or restricted in some countries  which may negatively impact our sales efforts 
in addition  substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm us by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 

table of contents the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or other heath related issues  could impact our customer or supply base  especially in asia a large percentage of our sales are to customers located in asia and a large percentage of our products are manufactured in asia 
our largest customer base in asia is located in taiwan 
our largest wafer source is located in china 
sars or other health related issues could have a negative impact on consumer demand  on travel needed to secure new business or manage our operations  on transportation of our products from our suppliers or to our customers  or on workers needed to manufacture our products or our customers products 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon financial results as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts  exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the non us dollar denominated currencies are principally the euro  swiss francs  and british pounds sterling 
we also have a significant number of employees that are paid in foreign currency  the largest being united kingdom based employees who are paid in british pounds sterling 
if the value of the united states dollar continues to weaken relative to these specific currencies  as it has done in recent years  the cost of doing business in terms of united states dollars goes up 
with the growth of our international business  our foreign currency exposures may grow and under certain circumstances  could harm our business 
we do a limited amount of hedging of our foreign exchange exposure 
in a limited number of cases  we have purchased forward contracts that lock in our right to purchase foreign currencies at an agreed upon rate 
in other cases  we convert united sates dollars into foreign currency in advance of the expected payment 
the use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure may be required to be marked to market each quarter and can create volatility in net income not directly tied to our operating results 
our future results may fluctuate  fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations our results may fluctuate in the future  may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
our results and related ratios  such as gross margin  operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  seasonality and variability in the computer market and our other end markets  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by our customers  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production  changes in manufacturing yields  capacity utilization  product mix and pricing  movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers  the manufacturing and delivery capabilities of our subcontractors  and litigation and regulatory matters 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results 

table of contents we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position the identity of our largest customers has varied from year to year 
historically  we have had significant customers that individually accounted for or more of consolidated revenues in certain quarters or represented or more of net accounts receivables at any given date 
we had several end customers in fiscal year that on an annual basis accounted for more than of net sales  but less than of net sales 
the last time we had an end customer that accounted for more than of net sales on an annual basis was in fiscal year  when one of our ate end customers  including its subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales 
several of our authorized distributors have regularly accounted for more than of net sales on an annual basis 
depending on the authorized distributor and their strategic focus  they can support anywhere from a few end customers to many end customers 
for fiscal year  two of our asian distributors accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net sales 
as of the end of fiscal year  one of these asian distributors accounted for approximately of net accounts receivable 
sales to our customers are generally made on open account  subject to credit limits we may impose  and the receivables are subject to the risk of being uncollectible 
we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
the loss of any significant customer  any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers  the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer s significant program or product could harm our business 
most of our authorized distributors  who represent nearly half of our net sales  can terminate their contract with us with little or no notice 
the termination of a distributor could negatively impact our business  including net sales and accounts receivable in fiscal year  authorized distributors accounted for approximately of our net sales 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our distributors and most can terminate their agreement with us with little or no notice 
for fiscal year  our two largest distributors were based in asia 
the termination of any distributor could impact our net sales and limit our access to certain end customers 
it could also result in the return of excess inventory of our product they hold as the distributor 
since many distributors simply resell finished products  they generally operate on very thin profit margins 
if a distributor were to terminate their agreement with us or go out of business  our unsecured accounts receivable from them are subject to collection risk 
we have acquired and may continue to acquire other companies and may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations in the past  we have expanded our operations through strategic acquisitions  and we may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  then we may experience disruptions that could harm our business 
some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate acquired companies include those associated with unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company  conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  coordinating new product and process development  hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

table of contents we must commit resources to product production prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment sales are made primarily on a current delivery basis  pursuant to purchase orders that may be revised or cancelled by our customers without penalty  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
some contracts require that we maintain inventories of certain products at levels above the anticipated needs of our customers 
as a result  we must commit resources to the production of products without binding purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could harm our business 
the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain the specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  marketing and managerial personnel 
we are dependent on a relatively small group of key technical personnel with analog and mixed signal expertise 
personnel with highly skilled managerial capabilities  and analog and mixed signal design expertise  are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key employees or that we will be successful in attracting  integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future 
if we are unable to retain the services of key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business could be harmed 
we are subject to government regulations and other standards that impose operational and reporting requirements we and our suppliers are subject to a variety of united states federal  foreign  state and local governmental laws  rules and regulations  including those related to the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of certain toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals 
if we or our suppliers were to incur substantial additional expenses to acquire equipment or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  product costs could significantly increase  thus harming our business 
we are also subject to laws  rules  and regulations related to export licensing and customs requirements  including the north american free trade agreement and state department and commerce department rules 
the sarbanes oxley act of required us to change or supplement some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices 
the sec and nasdaq have revised  and continue to revise  their regulations and listing standards 
these developments have increased  and may continue to increase  our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
these developments also may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
this  in turn  could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
failure to comply with present or future laws  rules and regulations of any kind that govern our business could result in suspension of all or a portion of production  cessation of all or a portion of operations  or the imposition of significant administrative  civil  or criminal penalties  any of which could harm our business 
earthquakes or other natural disasters may cause us significant losses our corporate headquarters  a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake 
we generally do not maintain flood coverage  including in our asian locations were we have certain operations support and sales offices 
such flood coverage has become very expensive  as a result the company has elected not to purchase this coverage 
our business could be harmed if natural disasters interfere with production of wafers by our suppliers  assembly and testing of products by our subcontractors  or our distribution network 
we maintain some business interruption insurance to help reduce the effect of such business interruptions  but we are not fully insured against such risks 
likewise  our business could be adversely impacted if a natural disaster were to shut down or significantly curtail production at one or more of our end customers 
any such loss of revenue due to a slowdown or cessation of end customer demand is uninsured 

table of contents terrorist attacks  war and other acts of violence may negatively affect our operations and your investment terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that took place on september   wars  such as the war in iraq  and other acts of violence  such as those that may result from the increasing tension in the middle east and the korean peninsula  or any other national or international crisis  calamity or emergency  may result in interruption to the business activities of many entities  business losses and overall disruption of the us economy at many levels 
these events may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our customers and suppliers 
additionally  these events or armed conflicts may cause some of our customers or potential customers to reduce the level of expenditures on their services and products that ultimately may reduce our revenue 
the consequences of these reductions are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
for example  as a result of these events  insurance premiums for businesses may increase and the scope of coverage may be decreased 
consequently  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our business and properties 
a high or orange or severe or red threat condition announced by the homeland security advisory system or similar agency and any consequent effect on the transportation industry may adversely affect our ability to timely import materials from our suppliers located outside the united states or impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers without incurring significant delays 
to the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in corporate spending  or our inability to effectively market our services and products  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies  but we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions  as well as our employees commitment to confidentiality and loyalty  to protect our know how and processes 
we intend to continue protecting our proprietary technology  including through trademark and copyright registrations and patents 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
our failure to adequately protect our material know how and processes could harm our business 
there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  that our patent applications will lead to issued patents  that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies  or that our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by others 
furthermore  the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
due to the number of competitors  intellectual property infringement is an ongoing risk since other companies in our industry could have intellectual property rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims 
any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management s resources 
if one of our products is found to infringe  we may have liability for past infringement and may need to seek a license going forward 
if a license is not available or if we are unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us  we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the product 
we could be required to register as an investment company and become subject to substantial regulation that would interfere with our ability to conduct our business the investment company act of requires the registration of companies which are engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities  or which are engaged in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities and which own or propose to acquire investment securities with a value of more than of the company s assets on an unconsolidated basis other than us government securities and cash 
we are not engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities  and we intend to invest our cash and cash equivalents in us government securities to the extent necessary to take advantage of the safe harbor 
to manage our cash holdings  we invest in short term instruments consistent with prudent cash management and the preservation of capital and not primarily for the purpose of achieving investment returns 
us government securities generally yield lower rates of income than other short term instruments in which we have invested to date 
accordingly  investing substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in us government securities could result in lower levels of interest income and net income 

table of contents if we were deemed an investment company and were unable to rely upon a safe harbor or exemption under the investment company act  we would among other things be prohibited from engaging in certain businesses or issuing certain securities 
certain of our contracts might be voidable  and we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance 
we are subject to review by taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service we are subject to review by domestic and foreign taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
in fiscal year  the irs completed a routine review of our through tax filings 
the final audit adjustments did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  future audits by taxing authorities could impact us 
changes in stock option accounting rules will impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and may impact our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
on october   the fasb concluded that the proposed statement of financial accounting standards  share based payment  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value  would be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  on april  the securities and exchange commission amended the compliance date for this new standard to be the next fiscal year that begins after june  we could adopt the new standard in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
assuming this new standard is implemented as scheduled  we will adopt this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal year should this proposed statement be finalized and implemented  it could have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the impact on our consolidated result of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this will result in lower reported earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  this could impact our ability to utilize broad based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we recently completed the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and an annual report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the assessment 
we also will be required to satisfy these requirements in future years 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in the prevention of financial fraud 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can impact on our market risk are external to the company  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience currency gains or losses 
because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure  we generally do not use forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the non us dollar denominated currencies are principally the euro  swiss francs and british pounds sterling 
additionally  certain of our current and long term liabilities are denominated principally in british pounds sterling currency  which is also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
substantially all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for the fiscal year ended january   we had approximately million of expenses that were settled in british pound sterling 
for this same period  we had approximately million of expenses that were settled in swiss francs and million of expenses that were settled in euros 
had rates of these various foreign currencies been higher relative to the us dollar in fiscal year  our costs would have increased approximately  related to expenses settled in british pound sterling  approximately  related to expenses settled in swiss francs and  related to expenses settled in euros 
as of the end of fiscal year  we held as part of cash and cash equivalents million of british pound sterling and  of swiss francs 
if rates of these foreign currencies were to move higher or lower by some percentage  it would have equal effect on the relative us dollar value of the balances we hold 
in fiscal year  we entered into a forward contract to purchase million swiss francs in fiscal year in exchange for million 
the forward contract was entered into as a partial hedge against future tax payments in swiss francs and shortly after maturity was used to help settle such tax liabilities 
interest rate and market risk as of january   we had no long term debt outstanding 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
as of january   we estimate that our pool of investments had an effective duration of  which implies that a increase in the prevailing interest rate could result in approximately million of additional unrealized loss on our investments 

table of contents our investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities
