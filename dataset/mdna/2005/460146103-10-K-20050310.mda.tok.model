because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls  material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
also  projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

as required by sfas no 
 an initial assessment of recorded goodwill for possible impairment was conducted as of january  annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the end of the third quarter of each year

impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value 
income taxes international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled

international paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates 
where the company believes that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in its income tax returns 
however  where treatment of an item is uncertain  tax accruals are recorded based upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the specific tax regulations and facts of each matter  the results of historical negotiated settlements  and the results of consultations with outside tax advisors 
these accruals for tax contingencies are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities 
changes to the reserves are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the probable outcome  such as a settlement with relevant tax authority  the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year  change in tax laws  or a relevant court decision that addresses the matter 
while the company believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances  actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts

environmental remediation costs costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable

furthermore  as required by the recent consensus of the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board fasb  the computations of diluted earnings per share for all prior periods have been restated on this basis 
a reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of earnings per common share from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes  and earnings per common share from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes  assuming dilution  is as follows in millions  except per share amounts earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes effect of dilutive securities earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming dilution average common shares outstanding effect of dilutive securities stock options average common shares outstanding assuming dilution earnings per common share from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes earnings per common share from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming dilution note if an amount does not appear in the above table  the security was antidilutive for the period presented

while the exact impact on expense will depend upon the number of remaining unvested options at that time  the adoption of this standard could increase pre tax compensation expense by approximately million in both and  with no significant impact on the company s financial statements in subsequent years 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which replaces the exception from fair value measurement in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

 disclosure of information about capital structure  relating to contingently convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on earnings per share 
the fsp required expanded disclosures of the significant terms of the conversion features of these securities to enable users of the financial statements to understand the circumstances of the contingencies and the potential impact of conversion 
these additional disclosures are presented for international paper s contingently convertible securities in note in october  the fasb ratified a consensus reached by the emerging issues task force of the fasb that  effective for periods ending after december   contingently convertible securities should be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share regardless of whether or not the market price trigger for issuance of the securities has been met 
furthermore  the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all prior periods presented should be restated to reflect this consensus 
at december   international paper had outstanding billion principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior debentures 
the debentures are contingently convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion ratio of shares per  principal amount at maturity of debentures totaling approximately million shares 
see note for additional information

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation changed existing consolidation rules for certain entities  those in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities vie s created after january   and to vie s in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
international paper has neither entered into nor obtained an interest in any vie s after january  for vie s created before february   this interpretation was effective for the first reporting period ending after december  during december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  fin r  with varying effective dates 
international paper applied fin r to its variable interest entities as of december  as a result of the application of the provisions of fin r during  four entities that were required to be consolidated under prior accounting rules were deconsolidated  and one previously unconsolidated entity was consolidated  at december  the following paragraphs describe the entities affected by the new fin r consolidation rules and the effects on international paper s december  financial statements a a special purpose leasing entity that was formerly part of an operating lease arrangement between international paper and a third party was determined to be a vie and required to be consolidated by the company

b in connection with a forestlands sale in  international paper received notes having a value of approximately million on the date of sale 
during  international paper contributed the notes to an unconsolidated entity in exchange for a preferred interest in that entity valued at approximately million  and accounted for this transfer as a sale of the notes for financial reporting purposes with no associated gain or loss 
also during  the entity acquired approximately million of other international paper debt obligations for cash 
in december  international paper acquired an option to purchase the third party s interest in the unconsolidated entity and modified the terms of the entity s special loss allocation between the third party and international paper 
these actions required the entity to be consolidated by international paper at december   resulting in increases in installment notes receivable included in deferred charges and other assets of million  long term debt of million and minority interest of million 
in the fourth quarter of  international paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the entity under the provisions of fin r and  accordingly  deconsolidated the entity effective december  at december   international paper s million preferred interest in the entity has been offset against million of international paper debt obligations since international paper has  and intends to effect  a legal right to net settle these two amounts 
c in a similar transaction completed in june  approximately million of installment notes received in connection with the sale of forestlands in various states were transferred to a consolidated entity in exchange for a preferred interest in the entity 
in the same period  the entity acquired international paper debt obligations of million for cash 
under the provisions of fin r  international paper is not the primary beneficiary of this entity  resulting in its deconsolidation as of december  the deconsolidation increased investments by million  long term debt by million  and decreased notes receivable included in deferred charges and other assets by million and minority interest by million 
d in the third quarter of  international paper capital trust and international paper capital trust iii the trusts  were determined to be vie s for which international paper is not the primary beneficiary 
prior to july   the trusts had been consolidated in the company s financial statements  and the preferred securities of the trusts of approximately billion were presented in the consolidated balance sheet as international paper obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiaries holding international paper debentures

exterior siding and roofing litigation three nationwide class action lawsuits relating to exterior siding and roofing products manufactured by masonite that were filed against international paper have been settled in recent years 
the first suit  entitled judy naef v 
masonite and international paper  was filed in december hardboard lawsuit 
the plaintiffs alleged that hardboard siding manufactured by masonite fails prematurely  allowing moisture intrusion that in turn causes damage to the structure underneath the siding 
the class consisted of all us property owners having masonite hardboard siding installed on and incorporated into buildings between january  and january  the court granted final approval of the settlement on january  the settlement provides for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved  and proofs of various other matters in order to qualify for payment with respect to a claim 
it also provides for the payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members  with a non refundable advance of million plus million in costs 
those amounts were paid to class counsel in for siding that was installed between january  and december   the deadline for filing claims expired january   and for siding installed between january  through january   claims must be made by january  the second suit  entitled cosby  et 
al 
v 
masonite corporation  et

the class consisted of all us property owners having omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from january  to january  the settlement relating to the omniwood lawsuit provides that qualified claims must be made by january  for omniwood siding that was installed between january  and january  the third suit  entitled smith  et 
al 
v 
masonite corporation  et 
al  was filed in woodruf lawsuit

the class consisted of all us property owners who had incorporated and installed masonite woodruf roofing from january  to january  the settlement relating to the woodruf lawsuit provides that for product installed between january  and december   claims must be made by january   and for product installed between january  and january   claims must be made by january  the court granted final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf lawsuits on january  the settlements provide for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved  and proofs of various other matters 
the settlements also provide for payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members with a non refundable advance of million plus  in costs for each of the two cases 
those amounts were paid in the liability for these matters was retained after the sale of masonite to premdor inc in claim filing and determination once a claim is determined to be valid under the respective settlement agreement covering the claim  the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a negotiated compensation formula established under the settlement agreements designed to compensate the homeowner for all damage to the structure 
the compensation formula is based on the average cost per square foot for product replacement  including material and labor as calculated by industry standards  in the area in which the structure is located  adjusted for inflation  or the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry standards in such area  adjusted for inflation 
persons receiving compensation pursuant to this formula also agree to release international paper and masonite from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question 
in connection with the products involved in the lawsuits described above  where there is damage  the process of degradation  once begun  continues until repairs are made 
international paper estimates that approximately million structures have installed products that are the subject of the hardboard lawsuit   structures have installed products that are subject to the omniwood lawsuit and  structures have installed products that are the subject of the woodruf lawsuit 
masonite stopped selling the products involved in the hardboard lawsuit in may  the products involved in the woodruf lawsuit in may  and the products involved in the omniwood lawsuit in september persons who are class members under the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits who do not pursue remedies under the respective settlement agreement pertaining to such suits may have recourse to warranties  if any  in existence at the expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements for making claims 
the warranty period generally extends for years following the installation of the product in question and  although the warranties vary from product to product  they generally provide for a payment of up to two times the purchase price 
reserve analysis the following table presents an analysis of the net reserve activity related to the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits for the years ended december   and during  tracking of the actual versus projected number of claims filed and average cost per claim indicated that although total claims costs were approximately equal to projected amounts  the number of claims filed was higher than projected  offsetting the effect of lower average claims payment amounts 
accordingly  updated projections were developed by two third party consultants utilizing the most current claims experience data 
principal assumptions used in the development of these projections were that the number of hardboard claims filed  which account for approximately of all claims costs  would average slightly above current levels until january  then would decline by about in and remain flat to the end of the claims period 
average claims costs were assumed to continue to decline at the rate experienced during the last twelve months 
while management believes that the assumptions used in developing these outcomes represent the most probable scenario  factors which could cause actual results to vary from these assumptions include area specific assumptions as to growth in claims rates could be incorrect  locations where previously there had been little or no claims could emerge as significant geographic locations  and the cost per claim could vary materially from that projected 
the first consultant provided two statistical outcomes  with the higher outcome indicating a required provision of approximately million 
the second consultant provided a range of possible outcomes  with the most probable outcome indicating a required provision of approximately million 
the estimate ranged from a low a probability that future charges would exceed this amount of million to a high probability that future charges would exceed this amount of million 
using these projections  management determined that a provision of million should be recorded in the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the most probable outcome based on the consultants projections 
during and  claims filed and average costs per claim were in line with projections and no adjustments of reserve balances were required 
reserve balances at december   net reserves for these matters totaled million  including million for the hardboard lawsuit  million for the omniwood lawsuit and million for the woodruf lawsuit 
at december   there were million of costs associated with claims inspected and not paid million for hardboard  million for omniwood and million for woodruf and million of costs associated with claims in process and not yet inspected million for claims related in millions hard board omni wood woodruf total balance  december  additional provision payments insurance collections balance  december  payments insurance collections balance  december  payments insurance collections balance  december  additional provisions in the third quarter of  a determination was made that an additional provision would be required to cover an expected shortfall in the reserves that had arisen since the third quarter of due to actual claims experience exceeding projections 
an additional million was added to the existing reserve balance at that time 
this increase was based on third party consultants statistical studies of future costs  which analyzed trends in the claims experience through august  the amount was based on a statistical outcome that assumed that hardboard claims growth continued through mid  then declined by per year 
omniwood claims growth was assumed to continue through mid  decline by in and thereafter increase at the rate of per year 
woodruf claims were assumed to decline at a rate of per year 
unit costs per claim were assumed to hold at the level 
the statistical model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the geographic patterns of claims rates and assumptions related to the cost of claims  including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation 
average claim costs were calculated from historical claims records  taking into consideration structure type  location and source of the claim 
to the hardboard lawsuit  million for claims related to the omniwood lawsuit and million for claims related to the woodruf lawsuit 
in addition  there were approximately million of costs associated with administrative and legal fees incurred but not paid prior to year end 
the estimated claims reserve includes million for unasserted claims that are probable of assertion 
while additional reserve balances may be required for future payments under the woodruf lawsuit  international paper believes that the aggregate reserve balance for claims arising in connection with exterior siding and roofing products  described above  are adequate  and that additional amounts will be recovered from its insurance carriers in the future relating to these claims described below 
international paper is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges  if any  which may be required for these matters in the future 
claims statistics the average settlement cost per claim for the years ended december    and for the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits is set forth in the table below average settlement cost per claim the above information is calculated by dividing the amount of claims paid by the number of claims paid 
through december   net settlement payments totaled million million for claims relating to the hardboard lawsuit  million for claims relating to the omniwood lawsuit and million for claims relating to the woodruf lawsuit  including million of non refundable attorneys advances discussed above million for the hardboard lawsuit and million for each of the omniwood lawsuit and woodruf lawsuit 
also  payments of million have been made to the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits 
in addition  through december   international paper had received million related to the hardboard lawsuit from our insurance carriers 
the following table shows an analysis of claims statistics related to the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits for the years ended december   and the table reflects an increase in the number of claims filed in december on the eve of the january deadline for filing certain claims under the hardboard lawsuit settlement agreement 
these increases were anticipated in prior claim projections and did not adversely affect the evaluation of the adequacy of reserve balances at december  hardboard omniwood woodruf in thousands single family multi family single family multi family single family multi family december  december  december  claims activity in thousands no

of claims dismissed december  insurance matters in november  international paper and masonite commenced a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of california against certain of their insurance carriers the indemnification lawsuit because of their refusal to indemnify international paper and masonite for  among other things  the settlement relating to the hardboard lawsuit and the refusal of one insurer  employer s insurance of wausau wausau  to provide a defense of that lawsuit 
during the fall of  a trial of masonite s claim that wausau breached its duty to defend the breach of duty lawsuit was conducted in a state court in california 
the jury found that wausau had breached its duty to defend masonite and awarded masonite million for its expense to defend the hardboard lawsuit  an additional million in attorneys fees and interest for masonite s expense to prosecute the breach of duty lawsuit based on a finding that wausau had acted in bad faith in refusing to defend the hardboard lawsuit and an additional million in punitive damages 
in a post trial proceeding  the court awarded an additional million in attorneys fees which masonite had incurred in the trial of the breach of duty lawsuit 
the trial of the indemnification lawsuit against insurers the defendants began in april to recover million paid to claimants pursuant to the settlement of the hardboard lawsuit through may in july  the jury determined that million of international paper s payments to settle these claims are covered by its insurance policies the phase i verdict 
in the current phase of the case the court will determine how much of the million can be allocated to the policies of the defendants 
the company anticipates that  before a judgment is entered  the california court will also make a determination about indemnification for future claims based on the phase i verdict 
the court will also determine whether amounts paid and to be paid to the plaintiff class counsel pursuant to the settlement of the hardboard lawsuit  and administrative expenses that have been and will be incurred in connection with that settlement  are covered by insurance 
a judgment has not yet been entered on the verdict in the indemnification lawsuit 
it is difficult to predict when the judgment will be entered 
this judgment will be subject to appeal when entered 
because of the uncertainties inherent in the litigation  including the outcome of any appeal  international paper is unable to estimate the amount that it ultimately may recover against its insurance carriers 
the company is presently engaged in court ordered mediation with several of the defendants 
during  international paper reached settlements with wausau  with respect to both the indemnification and the breach of duty lawsuits  and with four other insurance companies under which international paper received million  including approximately million received in  and an additional payment of million in january in addition  the company has begun arbitration proceedings against american excess insurance association and ace insurance company  ltd  to recover additional insurance proceeds 
as of december   international paper had received an aggregate of million in settlement payments from certain of its insurance carriers which had been named as defendants in the indemnification lawsuit or which otherwise provided international paper with insurance coverage for hardboard siding 
under an alternative risk transfer agreement  international paper contracted with a third party for payment in an amount up to million for certain costs relating to the indemnification lawsuit if payments by international paper with respect thereto exceeded a specified retention that was indexed to account for inflation over a several year period 
the agreement with the third party was in excess of liability insurance recoveries obtained by international paper  which are the subject of the separate litigation described above 
accordingly  international paper believes that the obligation of the third party with respect to this agreement did not constitute other valid and collectible insurance that would either limit or otherwise affect the company s right to collect insurance available to it and masonite under the insurance policies  which are the subject of the indemnification lawsuit 
at december   international paper had received the million from the third party 
a dispute between international paper and the third party  concerning a number of issues  including the relationship of the contract funding obligation to insurance proceeds recovered in the indemnification lawsuit  was the subject of an arbitration commenced in by the third party in london  england and scheduled to begin in february before the hearing started  the parties settled the dispute 
under the settlement  international paper agreed to pay the third party a portion of insurance proceeds recovered by international paper under its insurance policies  beginning on january  and thereafter  up to a maximum of million 
the precise amount that international paper will pay to the third party under the settlement will depend upon  and will be a specified portion of insurance recoveries received by international paper after january  as of december   approximately million had been paid to the third party under this settlement

the plaintiff in that case has filed a motion to remand the case to kansas state court 
the company is vigorously defending these cases and believes it has valid defenses 
however  due to the complexity of evaluating the factors upon which damages might be based including  but not limited to  the uncertainties of the class period  defendants sales to various opt out plaintiffs  and other defendants potential settlements  the company cannot assess its potential exposure at this time 
in  purchasers of high pressure laminates filed a number of purported class actions under the federal antitrust laws alleging that international paper s nevamar division which was part of the decorative products division participated in a price fixing conspiracy with competitors between january  and june  in and  indirect purchasers of high pressure laminates also filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in arizona  california  florida  maine  michigan  minnesota  new mexico  new york  north carolina  north dakota  south dakota  tennessee  west virginia  wisconsin and the district of columbia

the suit seeks injunctive relief as well as treble damages and other costs associated with the litigation 
on march   the case was certified as a class action 
international paper then asked the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit for permission to appeal the district court s order granting class certification  but that request was denied 
discovery and issues concerning class notice are ongoing 
on january   with the district court s approval  international paper filed motions requesting dismissal of the plaintiffs claim based on plaintiffs lack of standing to sue and decertification of the class 
the motions are scheduled for hearing on april  in may  the press reported that european  us and canadian antitrust authorities were investigating possible cartel activity relating to publication papers 
following these press reports  a number of private plaintiffs filed purported class actions on behalf of purchasers of publication papers in various us federal and state courts 
these class actions allege that manufacturers of publication papers  including international paper  participated in a price fixing consipiracy from to the present 
the cases filed in federal court assert a violation of the federal antitrust laws  while the cases filed in the state court allege violations of state antitrust and consumer protection statutes 
these lawsuits seek injunctive relief  as well as treble damages and other costs associated with the litigation 
the federal cases were consolidated for pre trial purposes in december in the federal court for the district of connecticut 
discovery and related pretrial proceedings have not yet begun 
discovery in the state cases is expected to be coordinated with the consolidated federal cases 
the company believes it has valid defenses and intends to vigorously defend these cases 
however  at this early stage the company cannot assess its potential exposure 
summary international paper is also involved in various other inquiries  administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts  sales of property  environmental protection  tax  antitrust  personal injury and other matters  some of which allege substantial monetary damages 
while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty  international paper believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened  or all of them combined  including the preceding antitrust matters  will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements

note derivatives and hedging activities international paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate  commodity and currency risks 
for hedges that meet the criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  international paper  at inception  formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies  in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities 
the earnings impact resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying exposure being hedged 
the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
the ineffective portion of a financial instrument s change in fair value  if any  would be recognized currently in earnings together with the changes in fair value of any derivatives not designated as hedges 
interest rate risk interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with international paper s debt 
some of these instruments qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
and others do not 
interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount at december  of approximately million and maturities ranging from two to years do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
and  consequently  were recorded at fair value on the transition date by a pre tax charge of approximately million to earnings in upon adoption of sfas no 
for the years ended december   and  the change in fair value of these swaps was immaterial 
the remainder of international paper s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fully effective fair value hedges under sfas no 
at december  and  outstanding notional amounts for its interest rate swap fair value hedges amounted to approximately billion and billion  respectively 
the fair values of these swaps were net assets of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  international paper cash settled interest rate swaption contracts for a loss of million  which was recorded in earnings 
in april  interest rate swaps with a notional value of million were terminated in connection with the early retirement of international paper s billion notes due in july the resulting gain of approximately million is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations see note 
in november  interest rate swaps with a notional value of million were terminated in connection with the early retirement of international paper s billion notes due in july the resulting gain of approximately million is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations see note 
during  international paper entered into agreements to fix interest rates on an anticipated billion issuance of debt 
upon issuance of the debt in the fourth quarter of  these agreements generated a pre tax loss of million that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
this amount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the bonds through october   yielding an effective interest rate of 
commodity risk to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities  international paper has used swap and option contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices 
such cash flow hedges are accounted for by deferring the after tax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in oci 
on the date a contract matures  the gain or loss is reclassified into cost of products sold concurrently with the recognition of the commodity purchased 
for the year ended december   the reclassification from oci to earnings was immaterial 
for the years ended and  the reclassifications to earnings were after tax gains of million and after tax losses of million  respectively 
these amounts represent the after tax cash settlements on the maturing energy hedge contracts 
unrealized after tax losses of million and after tax gains of million and million were recorded to oci during the years ended december   and  respectively 
there were no outstanding energy hedge contracts as of december  foreign currency risk international paper s policy has been to hedge certain investments in non us operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation s functional currency  or by entering into long term cross currency and interest rate swaps or short term foreign exchange contracts 
these financial instruments are effective as a hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments  which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the non us operation s net assets hedged  are recorded as translation adjustments in oci 
upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments  the accumulated gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments  together with the translation gains and losses on the net assets  are included in earnings 
for the years ended december   and  net losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment on derivative and debt instruments hedging foreign net investments amounted to million  million and million after taxes and minority interest  respectively 
cumulative after tax losses of million on net investment hedges were included in the loss on sale of weldwood in discontinued operations in long term cross currency and interest rate swaps and short term currency swaps have been used to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  affecting the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency 
in  chh paid million to settle these hedges concurrent with the repayment of the related debt 
prior to the settlement  the impact on earnings from the derivative revaluations were substantially offset by the earnings impact from remeasuring the foreign currency debt each period 
foreign exchange contracts including forward  swap and purchase option contracts are also used to hedge certain transactions  primarily trade receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies  to manage volatility associated with these transactions and to protect international paper from currency fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement 
these contracts  most of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  had maturities of five years or less as of december  for the years ended december   and  net unrealized gains totaling million  million and million after taxes and minority interest  respectively  were recorded to oci 
net gains after taxes and minority interest of million  million and million were reclassified to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of the net gains reclassified to earnings in  million related to hedges that are no longer probable 
as of december   gains of million after taxes and minority interest are expected to be reclassified to earnings in other contracts are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates on certain short term monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies and are not designated as hedges 
changes in the fair value of these instruments  recognized currently in earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities  were not significant 
international paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the counterparties to swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts consist of a number of major international financial institutions 
international paper continually monitors its positions with and the credit quality of these financial institutions and does not expect nonperformance by the counterparties

note retirement plans us defined benefit plans international paper maintains pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all domestic employees hired prior to july  these employees generally are eligible to participate in the plans upon completion of one year of service and attainment of age employees hired after june   who are not eligible for this pension plan will receive an additional company contribution to their savings plan see other plans on page 
the plans provide defined benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings salaried employees  hourly job rates or specified benefit rates hourly and union employees 
international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs  generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa

the nonqualified plan is only funded to the extent of benefits paid which are expected to be million in net periodic pension expense income service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year 
interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation  which is a discounted amount  due to the passage of time 
the expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long term rate of return 
net periodic pension expense income for qualified and nonqualified us defined benefit plans comprised the following in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets actuarial loss amortization of prior service cost net periodic pension expense income a a excludes million  million and million in  and  respectively  in curtailment losses  and million  million and million in  and  respectively  of special termination benefits  in connection with a cost reduction program and facility rationalizations that were recorded in restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
also excludes million and million of curtailment losses in and  respectively  and million of settlement gains in  related to the divestitures of masonite  flexible packaging  decorative products and other smaller businesses that were recorded in net losses gains on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in us pension expense  and the change in to net pension expense from income in  were principally due to a reduction in in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses  with smaller impacts from reductions in the discount rate and the assumed rate of future compensation increase 
international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of december the measurement date and considers changes in these long term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
these assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of december of the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year 
weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense income for  and were as follows discount rate to in from in  and a decrease in the expected return on assets to in from in the following illustrates the effect on pension expense for of a basis point decrease in these assumptions in millions expense income discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase investment policy strategy plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk and to maintain full funding of the benefit obligations 
the target allocations by asset class are summarized in the following table 
investments are diversified across classes and within each class to minimize risk 
the investment policy permits the use of swaps  options  forwards and futures contracts 
periodic reviews are made of investment policy objectives and investment managers 
international paper s pension plan asset allocation by type of fund at december  and  and target allocations by asset category are as follows discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of december  and were as follows percentage of plan assets at december  discount rate asset category target allocations rate of compensation increase the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan s investment portfolio 
projected rates of return are developed through an asset liability study  in which projected returns for each of the plan s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
based on the target asset allocation for each asset class  the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets 
the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately aa graded bonds 
the plan s projected cash flows are then matched to the yield curve to develop the discount rate 
to calculate pension expense for  the company will use an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and an assumed rate of compensation increase of

at the same date  the market value of the plan assets was less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo for this plan 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the prepaid asset was reversed and an additional minimum liability of billion was established equal to the shortfall of the market value of plan assets below the abo plus the prepaid benefit cost 
this resulted in an after tax direct charge to accumulated other comprehensive income oci of billion  with no impact on earnings  earnings per share or cash 
this reduction to shareholders equity had no adverse affect on international paper s debt covenants 
strong actual returns on plan assets in the fourth quarters of and increased the market value of plan assets by more than the increase in the abo  resulting in a reduction in the required additional minimum pension liability 
as a result  credits to after tax oci were recognized in the amount of million and million at december  and  respectively
