item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a leading supplier of a broad range of products used in a substantial number of aerospace and defense platforms 
we also are a major supplier of subsystems on many platforms  including those for secure communication networks and communication products  mobile satellite communications  information security systems  shipboard communications  naval power systems  fuzes and safety and arming devices for missiles and munitions  microwave assemblies for radars and missiles  telemetry and instrumentation  and airport security systems 
we also are a prime system contractor for aircraft modernization and o m  isr collection platforms  training and simulation  and government support services 
the substantial majority of our sales are generated using written revenue arrangements  or contracts 
most of these contracts require us to design  develop  manufacture  modify  upgrade  test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment  and to provide related engineering and technical services according to the buyer s specifications 
our primary customer is the dod 
for the year ended december   direct sales to the dod and indirect sales to the dod through its prime contractors and subcontractors provided  million  or of our consolidated sales 
our other customers include the dhs  us government intelligence agencies  major aerospace and defense contractors  allied foreign government ministries of defense  commercial customers and certain other us federal  state and local government agencies 
our objective is to grow our sales organically and through business acquisitions and to improve our profitability 
to achieve these objectives we intend to expand our share of existing programs and to participate in new programs by leveraging our existing customer relationships 
we expect to continue to benefit from the outsourcing of subsystems  components and products by prime contractors 
we plan to continue to align our research and development  manufacturing and new business efforts to complement our customers requirements and to provide state of the art products 
we plan to maintain a diversified and broad business mix with limited reliance on any single program  a favorable balance of cost reimbursable and fixed price type contracts  a significant follow on business and an attractive customer profile 
a significant portion of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire companies or assets that complement and enhance our existing businesses 
see business acquisitions below 
we have four reportable segments secure communications isr  training  simulation government services  aircraft modernization  o m and products formerly known as aviation products aircraft modernization  and specialized products 
our secure communications isr segment provides products and services for the global isr market as well as secure  high data rate communications systems and equipment primarily for military and other us government and allied foreign government reconnaissance and surveillance applications 
we believe our systems and products are critical elements for a substantial number of major communication  command and control  intelligence gathering and space systems 
our systems and products are used to connect a variety of airborne  space  ground and sea based communication systems and are used in the transmission  processing  recording  monitoring and dissemination functions of these communication systems 
our training  simulation government services segment provides maintenance and logistics support for training devices  communication systems support and engineering services  teaching and training services and marksmanship training systems and services 
our aircraft modernization  o m and products segment provides specialized aircraft modernization  upgrade and maintenance services and logistics support services  traffic alert and collision avoidance systems  terrain awareness warning systems  cockpit voice and flight data recorders  advanced cockpit avionics products and ruggedized custom cockpit displays 
our specialized products segment provides a broad range of products  including naval warfare products  telemetry and navigation products  sensors  premium fuzing products  security systems  training devices and microwave components 
in recent years  domestic and geo political developments have significantly affected the markets for defense systems  products and services 
there has been a fundamental and philosophical shift in focus from a threat based model to one that emphasizes the capabilities needed to defeat a full spectrum of adversaries  which has transformed the us defense posture to a capabilities based orientation 
this approach involves creating the ability for a more flexible response  with greater force agility and stronger space capabilities  and improved missile defense systems  network communications and information systems  and security systems 
this transformation also includes an increased emphasis on homeland defense 
the afghanistan and iraq wars have confirmed several of the conclusions reached in the us quadrennial defense review completed in and have also resulted in increased dod spending  primarily for war operations 
over the past several years  the dod budgets have experienced increased focus on command  control  communications  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance c isr  precision guided weapons  unmanned aerial vehicles uavs  network centric communications  special operations forces sof and missile defense 
in addition  the dod philosophy has focused on a transformation strategy that balances modernization and recapitalization or upgrading existing platforms while enhancing readiness and joint operations 
as a result  defense budget program allocations continue to favor advanced information technologies related to command  control and communications c and isr 
furthermore  the dod s emphasis on system interoperability  force multipliers and providing battlefield commanders with real time data is increasing the electronic content of nearly all major military procurement and research programs 
as a result  it is expected that the dod s budget for communications and defense electronics will continue to grow 
we believe l is well positioned to benefit from the expected increased spending in those areas 
while there is no assurance that the requested dod budget increases  particularly those for the dod procurement account  and research  development  test and evaluation account collectively referred to as the dod investment account  will continue to be approved by congress  the current outlook is one of increased dod spending  which we believe will continue to positively affect l s future orders and sales and favorably affect our future operating profits and cash flows because of increased sale volumes 
conversely  a decline in the dod budget would generally have a negative effect on future orders  sales  operating profits and cash flows of defense contractors  including l  depending on the weapons platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions 
however  l believes that its businesses are significant participants in the sectors of the dod investment account and operations and maintenance account that are the highest priority for us military transformation  and we believe that they will continue to be  even in a declining dod budget environment 
in addition  increased emphasis on us homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as security systems  information security  crisis management  preparedness and prevention services  and civilian security operations 
most of our contracts revenue arrangements with the us government are subject to us defense contract audit agency audits and various cost controls  and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the us government 
multiyear us government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable 
foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government 
business acquisitions a significant component of our growth strategy has been to enhance our existing product base through selective business acquisitions that will add new products in areas that complement our present technologies 
we intend to continue acquiring select businesses that exhibit significant market positions in their business areas  offer products that complement and or extend our product offerings and expand our customer base  and display positive sales  earnings and cash flow prospects 
the table below summarizes the more significant acquisitions that we have completed during  and  referred to herein as business acquisitions 
during  we used cash of million for business acquisitions

additionally  during  and  we purchased other businesses  which individually and in the aggregate were not material to our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows during the year acquired 
all of our business acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective effective dates of acquisition 
we regularly evaluate potential business acquisitions and joint venture transactions 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the components of the marine controls division of cae and will acquire the remaining business components after we receive the required regulatory approvals 
on february   we acquired the propulsion systems business unit of general dynamics 
on february   we acquired the electron dynamic devices business of the boeing company 
the aggregate purchase price paid in cash for these business acquisitions was million 
we financed these acquisitions using cash on hand 
we have not entered into any other agreements with respect to any material transactions through the date of this filing 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to i contract revenues and costs  ii market values for inventories reported at lower of cost or market  iii pension and postretirement benefit obligations  iv preliminary purchase price allocations for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of acquired businesses  v recoverability and valuation of recorded amounts of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  vi income taxes  including the valuations of deferred tax assets  vii litigation reserves  and viii environmental obligations 
actual amounts will differ from these estimates 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and inherently risky at the time of the estimate  use of reasonably different assumptions could have changed our estimates  particularly with respect to estimates of contract revenues and costs  and changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
contract revenue recognition and contract estimates 
the substantial majority of our contracts revenue arrangements require us to design  develop  manufacture  modify  upgrade  test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment  and to provide related engineering and technical services according to the buyer s specifications 
these sales are transacted using written revenue arrangements or contracts  which are generally either fixed price  cost reimbursable or time and material 
these contracts are covered by the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop and accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts arb 
in addition  cost reimbursable contracts are also specifically covered by accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  section a  government contracts  cost plus fixed fee contracts arb 
substantially all of our cost reimbursable and time and material contracts are with the us government  primarily with the department of defense 
certain of our contracts with the us government are multi year contracts that are funded annually by the customer  and sales on these multi year contracts are based on amounts appropriated funded by the us government 
sales and profits on fixed price contracts are substantially recognized using percentage of completion methods of accounting 
sales and profits on fixed price production contracts under which units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their contractual selling prices the units of delivery method 
sales and profits on other fixed price production contracts under which units are not produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process or under which a relatively few number of units are produced are recorded based on the ratio of incurred costs to total estimated costs at completion of the contract the cost to cost method 
under the percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance  which can exceed one year 
sales and profits on fixed price contracts that require us to perform services that are not related to production of tangible assets are recognized in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
accounting for the sales on a fixed price contract requires the preparation of estimates of the total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s statement of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion 
under the units of delivery percentage of completion method  sales on a fixed price contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
under the cost to cost percentage of completion method  sales on a fixed price contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of cumulative costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion  multiplied by i the total estimated contract revenue  less ii the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units of delivery method or cost to cost method is equal to i the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized  less ii the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract 
in the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenues  a loss arises  and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that it becomes evident 
the unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded as a component of other current liabilities entitled estimated cost in excess of estimated contract value to complete contracts in process 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenue  estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
sales on cost reimbursable type contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract and become billable to the customer  at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs 
the estimated profit on a cost reimbursable contract is generally fixed or variable based on the contract fee arrangement 
sales on time and material type contracts are recognized at an amount equal to the direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour  plus the actual costs of material and other direct non labor costs 
on a time and material contract the fixed hourly rates include amounts for the cost of direct labor  indirect contract costs and profit 
cost reimbursable or time and material contracts generally contain less estimation risks than fixed price contracts 
the impact of revisions in profit estimates for all types of contracts are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured 
the revisions in contract estimates  if significant  can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows  as well as our valuations of contracts in process 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the cost of acquired businesses commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as part of the purchase price allocations for our acquired businesses  identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights  or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  unless the intangible asset is comprised of the assembled workforce of the acquired business 
generally  the substantial majority of the intangible assets from the businesses that we acquire are derived from the intellectual capital of the management  administrative  scientific  engineering and technical employees of the acquired businesses 
the success of our businesses is primarily dependent on the management  contracting  engineering and technical skills and knowledge of our employees  rather than productive capital machinery and equipment 
generally  patents  trademarks and licenses are not material to our acquired businesses 
furthermore  our us government contracts revenue arrangements generally permit other companies to use our patents in most domestic work performed by such other companies for the us government 
therefore  the substantial majority of the intangible assets for our acquired businesses are recognized as goodwill 
the values assigned to acquired identifiable intangible assets for customer relationships and technology are determined  as of the date of acquisition  based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after tax cash flows from those assets over their lives  including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales  less a cost of capital charge  all of which is discounted to present value 
if actual future after tax cash flows differ significantly from their estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the identifiable intangible assets to their realizable values 
the value assigned to goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable acquired assets  both tangible and intangible  less liabilities assumed 
at december   we had goodwill of  million and identifiable intangible assets of million 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested  at a minimum  annually for each reporting unit using a two step process 
a reporting unit is an operating segment  as defined in paragraph of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or a component of an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed 
two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill to measure the impairment loss 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation approach  and is dependent on estimates for future sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization  income tax payments  working capital changes  and capital expenditures  as well as  expected growth rates for cash flows and long term interest rates  all of which are impacted by economic conditions related to the industries in which we operate as well as conditions in the us capital markets 
a decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan obligations 
the obligations for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long term assumptions  including discount rates for employee benefit liabilities  rates of return on plan assets  expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants in the case of pension plans  and expected annual increases in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of postretirement benefit obligations 
these long term assumptions are subject to revision based on changes in interest rates  financial market conditions  expected versus actual returns on plan assets  participant mortality rates and other actuarial assumptions  including future rates of salary increases  benefit formulas and levels  and rates of increase in the costs of benefits 
changes in the assumptions  if significant  can materially affect the amount of annual net periodic benefit costs recognized in our results of operations from one year to the next  the liabilities for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans  and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans 
valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  including million for loss carryforwards and million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods 
deferred income taxes are determined separately for each of our tax paying entities in each tax jurisdiction 
the future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law  and to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  we believe that l will be able to realize its deferred tax assets 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations for the periods presented are impacted significantly by our business acquisitions 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our business acquisitions 
presentation of sales and costs and expenses 
on the statements of operations  l presents its sales and costs and expenses in two categories  contracts  primarily us government and commercial  primarily products 
for a detailed description of these two categories  refer to note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the tables below provide two presentations of sales  operating income and operating margin data for l for the years ended december   and the first table presents the selected data segregated between l s us government contractor businesses and l s commercial businesses

during the third quarter  we changed the name of the reportable segment from aviation products aircraft modernization to aircraft modernization  o m and products 
the business and reporting units included in this reportable segment were not changed 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  consolidated sales increased by  million  or  to  million for from  million for organic sales growth for our defense businesses was  or million  driven by continued strong demand for our secure communications and isr systems  aircraft modernization  aviation products  training and government services  training devices  sensors and imaging products and naval power equipment and services 
organic sales growth for our commercial and other non military businesses was  or million  primarily due to increased volume for commercial aviation products and security products  partially offset by lower sales volume for explosives detection systems eds

l s days receivable outstanding dro was at december   compared with at december  we calculate our dro by dividing i our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables  by ii our sales for the last twelve month period adjusted  on a pro forma basis  to include sales from business acquisitions that we completed as of the end of the period which amounted to  million  multiplied by l s billed receivables  net of uncollectible account allowances  increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in billed receivables was primarily from l s us government contractor businesses and related to organic sales growth  as well as the business acquisitions 
the uncollectible accounts allowance decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december   because of write offs of uncollectible accounts in the uncollectible accounts relate to l s commercial businesses 
our us government and allied foreign government customers  which generated of l s sales for  present very low uncollectible account risks due to their high credit quality and  therefore  generally require no uncollectible account allowances 
l s days inventory held dih was at december   compared with at december  we calculate dih by dividing i our aggregate end of period net inventoried contract costs and inventories at lower of cost or market  by ii our cost of sales for the last twelve month period adjusted on a pro forma basis to include cost of sales from business acquisitions that we completed as of the end of the period which amounted to  million  multiplied by the increase in property  plant and equipment pp e during was principally related to the infrared products  cincinnati electronics and electronics systems acquired businesses 
the percentage of depreciation expense to average gross pp e increased to for from for the increase was attributable to the impact of business acquisitions completed during we did not change any of the depreciation methods or assets estimated useful lives that l uses to calculate its depreciation expense 
goodwill increased by million to  million at december   from  million at december  the increase was comprised of i million for business acquisitions completed during  ii million for increases to purchase price payments for certain acquisitions completed prior to january   related to final closing date net assets of the acquired businesses and contingent purchase price adjustments or earnouts  which were resolved during the period  and iii a decrease of million primarily related to final estimates of fair value for acquired assets and liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions completed prior to january  the increase in accounts payable was due to increased purchases from third party vendors and subcontractors to support higher volumes for sales and related contracts in process  and the timing of payments for such purchases and to business acquisitions completed during the increase in accrued employment costs was due to the timing of payments of salaries and wages to employees and to business acquisitions completed during the increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated profits was primarily due to an increase in collections for milestone billings on contracts for training devices and services related to the completion of certain performance milestones and an increase for contracts in process with credit balances 
the decrease in other current liabilities was primarily due to the payment of the remaining purchase price for the acquisition of certain aerospace and defense assets of ipicom  inc  and to cash payments for costs incurred in excess of contract values for certain contracts in a loss position 
the increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities was primarily due to the increase in the minimum liability of million  discussed below 
the increase in other liabilities was due to amounts from our acquired businesses 
customer advances increased by million because collections exceeded liquidations  primarily related to cash payments received on contracts with foreign customers for isr systems  acoustic undersea warfare products and aircraft modernization and to the business acquisitions we completed during the timing of collections and liquidation of customer advances are prescribed by contract terms  and generally do not coincide because collections mostly occur upon the award of a contract and during the earlier periods of performance 
conversely  liquidations mostly occur during later periods of performance as products are delivered and other work items are completed 
additionally  customer advances do not affect or determine the timing of revenue recognition for a contract because customer advances are a contract financing method 
pension plans l maintains defined benefit pension plans covering employees at certain of its businesses 
at december   our balance sheet included a pension benefits liability of million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase is due to pension expense recognized exceeding our pension funding and an increase in the minimum liability of million 
at the end of  l s projected benefit obligation  which includes accumulated benefits plus the incremental benefits attributable to projected future salary increases for covered employees  was  million and exceeded the fair value of l s pension plan assets of million by million 
at the end of  l s projected benefit obligation was million and exceeded the fair value of l s pension plan assets of million by million 
the increase in the unfunded status of our pension plans of million from million at the end of to million at the end of was principally due to the million actuarial loss that we experienced in our actuarial loss was primarily due to the reduction in the discount rate by basis points to at the end of from at the end of  which increased the present value of l s projected benefit obligations at the end of by million 
the difference between the unfunded status amount of million at the end of and the pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of million is attributable to the cumulative net unrecognized actuarial losses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  the actuarial gains and losses that our pension plans experience are not recognized in pension expense in the year incurred  but rather deferred and amortized to pension expense in future periods over the estimated average remaining service periods of the covered employees 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
l uses a november measurement date to determine its end of year december pension benefit obligations and fair value of pension plan assets  and a fiscal year ending november to determine its annual pension expense  including actual returns on plan assets 
l s actual return on plan assets for  based on the fiscal year ended november   was million  or  on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the fiscal year 
our pension expense for was million 
we expect pension expense for to be between million and million 
as discussed above  at the end of we reduced our discount rate from to  which will increase the interest cost component of pension expense for the higher interest cost in our estimated pension expense is expected to be substantially offset by the increase of million in our pension plan assets during  which will increase our expected return on plan assets by approximately million  and decrease our estimated pension expense by the same amount 
our actual pension expense for will be based upon a number of factors  including the effect of any additional business acquisitions for which we assume liabilities for pension benefits  actual pension plan contributions and changes if any to our pension assumptions for  including the discount rate  expected long term return on plan assets and salary increases 
our contributions for the full year were million 
for  we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans 
a substantial portion of our pension plan contributions for l s businesses that are us government contractors are recoverable as allowable indirect contract costs at amounts generally equal to the annual pension contributions 
our projected benefit obligation and annual pension expense are significantly affected by the discount rate assumption we use 
for example  an additional reduction to the discount rate of basis points would have increased our projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million  and our estimated pension expense for by approximately million 
conversely  an increase to the discount rate of basis points would have decreased our projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million  and our estimated pension expense for by approximately million 
our shareholders equity at december  reflects a non cash charge of million net of tax to record the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to additional minimum pension liability recognized for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
this non cash charge had no effect on our compliance with the financial covenants of our debt agreements and did not impact our results of operations for statement of cash flows our cash position was million at december  and million at december  and the table below provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated

non cash expenses increased by million to million in from million in  primarily for depreciation and amortization  contributions to employee savings plans in l holdings common stock and deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes increased by million to million for from million for  primarily because of larger estimated tax deductions arising from our recent business acquisitions 
during  we used cash for changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  compared to million for the use of cash for contracts in process was primarily driven by increases in unbilled contract receivables and billed receivables arising from the organic sales growth for our businesses  as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources balance sheet and results of operations 
the use of cash for other current assets was primarily due to deposits paid to vendors during the use of cash for other assets was primarily due to investments in equipment for training devices and airport security systems leased to customers and capitalized software development costs for new products 
the source of cash for accounts payable was due to increased purchases of materials  components and services required for the increase in sales during the year and the timing of payments for such purchases 
the increase in the number of employees and the timing of payments for salaries and wages was a source of cash because costs and expenses for salaries and wages exceeded the cash payments 
the source of cash for billings in excess of costs and estimated profits was due to cash collections for milestone billings on certain contracts primarily for training devices 
the source of cash related to customer advances was due to receipt on certain foreign contracts awarded during the fourth quarter 
the use of cash for other current liabilities was due to the payment upon settlement of a foreign currency hedging forward contract and cash payments for costs incurred in excess of estimated contract values for certain contracts in a loss position 
the source of cash from the change in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities was due to expenses exceeding related cash contributions

during  we used cash for changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  compared to million in our cash flows from operating activities during reflect increases in unbilled receivables and other assets 
the use of cash for accounts payable was due to the timing of payments 
the use of cash for other current liabilities was to fund contracts in a loss position for which estimated costs exceeded the estimated contract value  and was partially offset by cash collections for milestone billings in excess of costs incurred primarily for training devices 
the timing of payments to employees for salaries and wages was a source of cash 
pension plan contributions in amounted to million 
the source of cash from other liabilities was generated primarily from terminating interest rate swap agreements 
during  we terminated interest rate swap agreements  which is discussed in derivative financial instruments  and generated cash proceeds related to deferred gains on them of million  of which million was recorded in other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities 
for  we also terminated interest rate swap agreements and generated cash proceeds related to net deferred gains on them of million 
our cash flows from operating activities during reflect increases in billed and unbilled receivables  other current assets and other assets 
the use of cash related to customer advances was due to liquidations on certain foreign contracts 
the use of cash for other current liabilities was to fund contracts in a loss position for which estimated costs exceed the estimated contract value  and was partially offset by an increase in accrued warranty costs primarily for explosive detection systems delivered in the timing of payments to employees for salaries and wages  as well as the timing of interest payments  was a source of cash 
the source of cash in other liabilities was primarily due to deferred gains on the termination of our swap agreements 
pension plan contributions in amounted to million 
our cash from operating activities includes interest payments on debt of million for  million for and million for our interest expense also includes amortization of deferred debt issue costs and deferred gains on terminated interest rate swap agreements  which are non cash items 
our cash from operating activities includes income tax payments  net of refunds  of million for  million for and million for our income tax payments were substantially less than our provisions for income taxes reported on our statements of operations primarily because of income tax deductions from our acquired businesses structured as asset purchases and income tax deductions for compensation expense arising from the exercise of employee stock options 
the income tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options are accounted for as a reduction to current income taxes payable and an increase to shareholders equity see note to our consolidated financial statements 
l receives substantial income tax deductions from its business acquisitions that are structured as asset purchases for income tax purposes 
the effect of these income tax deductions is that our cash payments for income taxes are less than our provision for income taxes reported on the statement of operations 
this difference is presented in the deferred income tax provision on our statement of cash flows 
the deferred income tax provision primarily results from deducting amortization of tax intangibles  including goodwill  from the business acquisitions structured as asset purchases on l s income tax returns over years  in accordance with income tax rules and regulations  while no goodwill amortization is recorded for financial reporting purposes  in accordance with sfas no 
we expect that the business acquisitions l has completed through december  will continue to generate substantial annual deferred tax benefits through while these income tax deductions are reported as changes to deferred income tax liabilities and assets  they are not differences that are scheduled to reverse in future periods from normal operations 
rather  they will only reverse if l sells its acquired businesses or incurs a goodwill impairment loss for them  because in either case  l s financial reporting amounts for goodwill would be greater than the income tax basis for goodwill 
l also receives significant income tax deductions and deferred tax benefits from its acquired businesses structured as asset purchases for income tax purposes from accelerated depreciation of plant and equipment

debt covenants and other provisions 
the new senior credit facility  which was entered into on march   and senior subordinated notes agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictive covenants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt and related financial covenants under our new senior credit facility 
we are in compliance with those covenants in all material respects 
the new senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes indentures limit the ability of l communications to pay dividends to and make investments in l holdings  subject to exceptions  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the new senior credit facility contains cross default provisions that are triggered when a payment default occurs or certain other defaults occur that would allow the acceleration of indebtedness  guarantee obligations or certain other agreements of l communications or its subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of at least million and those defaults other than payment defaults and defaults that have resulted in acceleration have not been cured after days 
the senior subordinated notes indentures contain cross acceleration provisions that are triggered when holders of the indebtedness of l holdings  l communications or their restricted subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by such entities accelerate at least million in aggregate principal amount of those obligations 
the new senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes indentures also contain other customary events of default 
the borrowings under the new senior credit facility are guaranteed by l holdings and by substantially all of the material wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of l communications on a senior basis 
the payments of principal and premium  if any  and interest on the senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by substantially all of l communications restricted subsidiaries other than its foreign subsidiaries 
the guarantees of the senior subordinated notes rank pari passu with one another and are junior to the guarantees of the new senior credit facility 
in the event that the long term debt rating of l communications is reduced below bbb  or the equivalent 
by two of the three rating agencies  standard poor s rating services  moody s investors service  inc  or fitch ratings  l holdings will be required  within business days  to pledge of the capital stock of l communications  and l communications and each subsidiary guarantor will be required to pledge of the capital stock of each of their material wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and of their material wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  in favor of the lenders under the new senior credit facility 
equity in january of  l holdings announced that its board of directors had declared l s first quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on march  l holdings board of directors declared three additional quarterly dividends of per share  all of which were paid in l holdings paid cash dividends of million in aggregate to shareholders in the cash dividends were paid on march  june  september and december on february   we announced that our board of directors had increased l s regular quarterly cash dividend by to per share  payable on march   to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  on february   l holdings had  shares of common stock outstanding 
on june   l holdings sold million shares of its common stock in a public offering for per share 
upon closing  we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
the net proceeds from this sale and the concurrent sale of senior subordinated notes by l communications were used to i repay million borrowed on march   under our senior subordinated bridge loan facility  ii repay the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facilities  iii repurchase and redeem the senior subordinated notes due discussed above and iv increase cash and cash equivalents 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a two for one stock split on all shares of l holdings common stock 
the stock split entitled all shareholders of record at the close of business on may  to receive one additional share of l holdings common stock for every share held on that date 
the additional shares were distributed to shareholders in the form of a stock dividend on may  upon completion of the stock spilt  l holdings had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
anticipated sources of cash flow based upon our current level of operations  we believe that our cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the new senior credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  commitments  research and development expenditures  contingent purchase prices  program and other discretionary investments  l holdings dividends and interest payments for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels  or that currently anticipated improvements will be achieved 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt  we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness  to make necessary capital expenditures and to make discretionary investments

other long term liabilities primarily consists of workers compensation  deferred compensation and litigation settlement accruals for the years ending december  and thereafter and also includes pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions that we expect to pay in

our pension and postretirement benefit plan funding policy is generally to contribute in accordance with cost accounting standards that affect government contractors  subject to the internal revenue code and regulations thereon 
for  we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans and million to our postretirement benefit plans 
due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension and postretirement benefit plan funding  we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of year

represents additional purchase payments for business acquisitions that are contingent upon the post aquisition financial performance of the acquired business 
off balance sheet arrangements on december   we entered into two real estate lease agreements  as lessee  with a third party lessor  which expire on december  and are accounted for as operating leases 
on or before the lease expiration date  we can exercise options under the lease agreements to either renew the leases  purchase both properties for million  or sell both properties on behalf of the lessor the sale option 
if we elect the sale option  we must pay the lessor a residual guarantee amount of million for both properties  on or before the lease expiration date  and at the time both properties are sold  we must pay the lessor a supplemental rent equal to the gross sales proceeds in excess of the residual guarantee amount not to exceed million 
we have a contract to provide and operate for the us air force usaf a full service training facility  including simulator systems adjacent to a usaf base in oklahoma 
we acted as the construction agent on behalf of the third party owner lessors for procurement and construction for the simulator systems  which were completed and delivered in august on december   we  as lessee  entered into an operating lease agreement for a term of years for one of the simulator systems with the owner lessor 
at the end of the lease term  we may elect to purchase the simulator system at fair market value  which can be no less than million and no greater than million 
if we do not elect to purchase the simulator system  then on the date of expiration  we shall pay to the lessor  as additional rent  million and return the simulator system to the lessor 
the aggregate non cancelable rental payments under this operating lease are million  including the additional rent of million 
on february   we  as lessee  entered into an operating lease agreement for a term of years for the remaining simulation systems with the owner lessor 
at the end of the lease term  we may elect to purchase the simulator systems at fair market value  which can be no less than million and no greater than million 
if we do not elect to purchase the simulator systems  then on the date of expiration  we shall return the simulator systems to the lessor 
the aggregate non cancelable rental payments under this operating lease are million 
derivative financial instruments included in our derivative financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency put options and interest rate swap agreements 
all of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates include borrowings under the senior credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements  all of which are denominated in us dollars 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
the interest rates on the senior subordinated notes are fixed rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates 
depending on interest rate levels  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to convert certain of our fixed interest rate debt obligations to variable interest rates  or terminate any existing interest rate swap agreements 
the variable interest rate paid by us is equal to i the variable rate basis  plus ii the variable rate spread 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed table of our interest rate swap agreement that is currently outstanding  and a table that presents the activity for our terminated interest rate swap agreements through december  outstanding interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by million during  compared to million during interest expense was reduced by million for  compared to million for for amortization of deferred gains on terminated interest rate swap agreements 
for every basis point that the six month usd libor interest rate is greater than  we will incur an additional  of interest expense above the fixed interest rate on million of senior subordinated notes calculated on a per annum basis until maturity 
conversely  for every basis point that the six month usd libor interest rate is less than  we will recognize interest income of  on million of senior subordinated notes calculated on a per annum basis until maturity 
when we enter into interest rate swap agreements  we attempt to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with major financial institutions that are expected to be able to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
cash payments between us and the counterparties are made in accordance with the terms of the interest rate swap agreements 
such payments are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
additional data on our debt obligations  our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we pay on borrowings under the senior credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements are provided in notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct some of our operations outside the us in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  some of our us and foreign operations have contracts with customers which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of those operations 
to mitigate the risk associated with certain of these contracts denominated in foreign currency we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts and put options 
at december   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and the fair value of these contracts was million  which represented a liability 
there were no foreign currency put options outstanding at december  we account for these contracts as cash flow hedges 
equity price risk 
our equity investments in common stocks  joint ventures and limited liability corporations are subject to equity price risk  including equity risk 
the fair values of our investments are based on quoted market prices for investments which are readily marketable securities  and estimated fair value for nonreadily marketable securities  which is generally equal to historical cost unless such investment has experienced an other than temporary impairment 
both the carrying values and estimated fair values of such investments amounted to million at the end of backlog and orders we define funded backlog as the value of funded orders received from customers  less the amount of sales recognized on those funded orders 
we define funded orders as the value of contract awards received from the us government  for which the us government has appropriated funds  plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the us government

contingencies we are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the us government and  to a lesser degree  under foreign government contracts  some of which are funded by the us government 
all such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements  and  periodically  agencies of the us government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements 
under us government procurement regulations  an indictment by a federal grand jury could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts 
a conviction could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term 
additionally  in the event that us government expenditures for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide are reduced and not offset by greater commercial sales or other new programs or products or business acquisitions  there may be a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us 
we are currently cooperating with the us government on several investigations  none of which we anticipate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws 
while it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost that we will incur to comply with these laws  based upon available internal and external assessments  with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware  we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries  if any  there are no environmental loss contingencies that  individually or in the aggregate  would be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
also  we have been periodically subject to litigation  claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business 
we accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in connection with the is acquisition we assumed responsibility for implementing certain corrective actions required under federal law to remediate the greenville  texas site location  and to pay a portion of those remediation costs 
the hazardous substances requiring remediation have been substantially characterized  and the remediation system has been partially implemented 
we have estimated that our share of the remediation cost will not exceed million  and will be incurred over a period of years 
we have established adequate reserves for these costs 
with respect to those investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments of which we are aware  we are of the opinion that the likelihood of loss is less than probable that  after taking into account certain provisions for these matters  the ultimate resolution of any such investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

recently issued accounting standards in december of  the fasb revised its fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and renamed it fasb statement no 
 share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation expense relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements at estimated fair value 
the scope of sfas r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
this standard replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas r for the interim period ending september  we are currently assessing the provisions of sfas r 
we previously elected not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as permitted by sfas the adoption of sfas r will result in the recording of non cash compensation expenses  which we do not currently recognize in our financial statements 
in accordance with sfas  we disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share adjusted for non cash compensation expense arising from the estimated fair value of share based payment transactions 
for a further discussion of our accounting for stock based employee compensation and disclosure of our pro forma historical net income and earnings per share  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the us enacted the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act in october  which contains many provisions affecting corporate taxation 
the american jobs creation act phases out the extraterritorial income eti exclusion benefit for export sales and phases in a new tax deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities qpa over a transition period beginning in in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  which provides guidance that the qpa deduction should be treated as a special income tax deduction as described in sfas as such  qpa has no impact on our deferred tax assets or liabilities existing as of the enactment date 
rather  the qpa deduction will be reported in the period that the deductions are claimed on our income tax returns 
while we have not completed our evaluation of the net impact of the american jobs creation act  we believe that the benefit from the phase in of the qpa deduction will be substantially equivalent to the lost benefit from the phase out of the eti exclusion in we do not expect that the other provisions included in the american jobs creation act will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on september   the eitf reached a consensus on issue no

on december   president bush signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
this act introduces a federal subsidy to employers who sponsor retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
on january   the centers for medicare and medical services cms released final regulations implementing the act 
we have not determined the possible effect of the final regulations on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
in may of  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act and requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act 
in accordance with fsp we have accounted for the effect of the act on a preliminary basis and disclosed the effect in note of our audited consolidated financial statements 
inflation the effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant 
although a majority of our sales are made under long term contracts revenue arrangements  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods 
in addition  some of our contracts provide for price adjustments through cost escalation clauses 
forward looking statements certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations  cash flows  financial position  economic performance and financial condition  including in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  including projections of orders  sales  operating margins  earnings  cash flow  research and development costs  working capital  capital expenditures and other projections  they are subject to several risks and uncertainties  and therefore  we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved 
such statements will also be influenced by factors such as
