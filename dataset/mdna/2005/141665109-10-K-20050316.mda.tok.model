 revenue recognition  we corrected our revenue recognition policy with respect to culinary and health education programs with externships 
these programs require students to complete externships upon conclusion of in school instruction in order to satisfy graduation requirements 
previously  we recognized revenue related to these programs with required externships on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable period of in school instruction 
in accordance with our newly adopted revenue recognition policy  we recognize revenue related to these programs on a straight line basis over the length of the entire program  which includes the externship period 
the change in our revenue recognition policy with respect to culinary and health education programs with externships resulted in a reduction of revenue during of approximately million and a reduction of net income during of approximately million  or per diluted share 
additionally  prior period financial statements and the related notes thereto presented herein have been restated to reflect the impact of the change in our revenue recognition policy 
the effect of the change on net income was million  or per diluted share 
our net income per diluted share decreased from as previously reported to as a result of the restatement 
the effect of the change on net income was million  or per diluted share 
our net income per diluted share decreased from as previously reported to as a result of the restatement 
the change in our revenue recognition policy with respect to culinary and health education programs with externships affected only our csu segment financial results

as a result of these differences  the unaudited financial results contained in our form k should not be relied upon 
change in accounting estimate effective december   we increased our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to student receivables 
we periodically evaluate our student receivables balances and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates and assumptions  which we review and modify based on emerging information 
we recently analyzed our student receivables collection rates  together with changes in financial aid funding sources  and determined that we should increase our estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts and also modify our estimation methodology 
among other things  our recent analysis reflected a correlation between student funding sources and the ultimate collectibility of accounts due from our in school student population 
based on the results of our analysis  we determined that it would be appropriate to utilize an allowance estimation methodology that segments our accounts receivable due from in school students into groups according to each student s primary funding source  exclusive of stafford loans and federal and state grants 
in addition  we have modified our allowance methodology for out of school student accounts to segregate such accounts into two categories of students those who complete their programs of study and those that do not 
for more information concerning our allowance estimation methodology  please see summary of critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts 
our revised allowance estimation methodology has been applied to our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  the change in our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts resulted in additional bad debt expense being recorded in general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of of approximately million million after taxes  or per diluted share 
as previously reported  in connection with the special committee investigation described in legal proceedings other litigation and investigations  navigant consulting  inc  at the request of the special committee  has reviewed our new estimation methodology and found it to be reasonable 
navigant s scope of work did not include calculating the amount of  or determining the timing or nature of  the expense we have recorded 
the sec s division of corporation finance is undergoing a review of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and subsequent quarterly reports in among other things  the division of corporation finance has inquired about our accounting for the change in our allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of described above 
we believe the accounting for our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial statements overall are presented fairly in all material respects and in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
however  we have not completed the review process with the division of corporation finance and cannot predict the timing or outcome of their review  and there is no assurance that such outcome will not necessitate amendments or restatements of our previously filed periodic reports or financial statements  or of the financial statements included in this report 
overview we are one of the largest providers of private  for profit  postsecondary education 
we have segregated our operations into two distinct operating segments  our csu segment and our oeg segment 
our csu segment represents an aggregation of our traditional brick and mortar campuses through which we provide educational services primarily in a classroom or laboratory setting at campuses located throughout the united states and in france  canada  the united kingdom  and the united arab emirates 
our oeg segment operates two online educational platforms  american intercontinental university online and colorado technical university online  that deliver educational services through internet based courses 
our total student population as of january   was approximately  students  including total oeg student population as of january  of approximately  students 
many of our schools enjoy long operating histories  and our schools offer a variety of doctoral degree  master s degree  bachelor s degree  associate degree  and diploma programs in career oriented disciplines within our core curricula of business studies culinary arts health education information technology visual communication and design technologies we have experienced significant growth both organically and through acquisitions 
since our inception in january  we have completed acquisitions and have opened branch start up campuses 
our annual revenue has increased from million in to billion in  and our annual net income has increased from million in to million in in  the student population declined at our gibbs division schools  which are included in our csu segment 
this decline in student population resulted in decreased revenue for the division and negatively impacted the division s as well as our csu segment s profitability for the period 
we are expecting limited growth and low levels of profitability from the gibbs division in the near term 
our management is devoting increased attention to the gibbs division in order to improve the division s performance 
revenue our principal source of revenue is tuition collected from our students 
the academic year for our institutions is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by term  which is determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school and on the type of program and specific curriculum 
our students finance tuition costs through the use of a variety of fund sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
our schools generally increase tuition one or more times annually 
other revenue consists primarily of bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  contract training revenue  cafeteria revenue  rental income  and placement revenue 
while the reputations of some of our schools allow them to charge fees to employers for placement of our students  a majority of our placement services are provided at no cost to employers and do not result in the recognition of placement revenue 
we do not charge fees to any of our students as a result of a student s placement 
placement revenue for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
operating expenses educational services and facilities expense includes costs directly attributable to the educational activity of our campuses  including among other things  salaries and benefits of faculty  academic administrators  student support personnel  costs of educational supplies and facilities  including rents on school leases  distance learning costs  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories  costs of student housing  owned and leased facility costs  royalty fees paid to le cordon bleu  and certain student financing costs 
also included in educational services and facilities expenses are costs of other goods and services provided by our schools  including costs of textbooks  laptop computers  dormitory services  restaurant services  contract training  cafeteria services  rental services  and printroom services 
general and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in corporate and school administration  marketing  admissions  accounting  human resources  and compliance 
costs of promotion and development  advertising and production of marketing materials  occupancy of the corporate offices  and bad debt expense are also included in this expense category 
for information regarding our change in estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to student receivables and the impact of such change on our bad debt expense  see our discussion of change in accounting estimate above 
depreciation expense includes costs associated with the depreciation of  among other things  purchased computer laboratories  equipment  furniture and fixtures  courseware  owned facilities  and capitalized leased equipment 
depreciation is recognized using the straight line method over the useful lives or lease terms of the related assets for financial reporting purposes and an accelerated method for income tax reporting purposes 
amortization expense includes the amortization of definite lived intangible assets 
share of affiliate earnings share of affiliate earnings represents our share of the income of au dubai  in which we hold a minority interest 
our interest in au dubai is accounted for using the equity method  and  therefore  the entity s financial statements are not consolidated into our financial statements 
other income expense other income expense includes certain infrequent transactions  such as gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment  gains or losses on foreign currency exchange  and gains or losses on assets held in our rabbi trust 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies listed below that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item exhibits and financial statement schedules in this annual report on form k  which includes other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools  both brick and mortar and online 
we generally segregate our revenue into two categories  tuition and registration fees and other revenues 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students of educational services provided by our schools 
we generally bill a student for tuition at the beginning of an academic term  and we recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the academic term 
the portion of tuition payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet  as such amount represents revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term  we refund the portion of tuition already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
other revenue consists of  among other things  bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  contract training revenue  cafeteria revenue  rental income  and placement service fees 
revenue from dormitory and cafeteria fees is generally billed to a student at the beginning of an academic term and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue  as well as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  placement revenue  restaurant revenue  rental income  and contract training revenue  is billed and recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
certain of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies 
such billings  which we treat as a single accounting unit in accordance with eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  are recognized as tuition and registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term 
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
our schools calculate and record allowances for doubtful accounts based on a standard allowance estimation methodology developed by corporate financial management 
as discussed in change in accounting estimate  we recently modified our allowance estimation methodology 
our standard allowance estimation methodology  effective as of december   considers a number of new factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on our credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source for example  federal loan or grant  state grant  private loan  student cash payments  etc  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections history 
specifically  our allowance estimation methodology segments our accounts receivable due from in school students into groups according to each student s primary funding source  exclusive of stafford loans and federal and state grants 
our allowance methodology for out of school student accounts segments such accounts into two categories of students those who complete their programs of study and those that do not 
we apply allowable percentage estimates  which are based upon our historical collections experience  to each in school student funding source group and out of school student category 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
on at least an annual basis  we intend to monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance estimates are necessary 
in this way  we believe that our allowance estimation methodology will reflect our most recent collections experience and will be responsive to changes in the total mix of student funding sources 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
our standard allowance estimation methodology is evaluated for propriety by corporate financial management on a periodic basis and modified as necessary 
changes to the design of our standard allowance estimation methodology  including our allowance percentage estimates  may impact our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
corporate financial management reviews the allowance estimate calculations completed by each of our campuses to monitor compliance with our allowance estimation methodology and  based on judgment and consideration of emerging trends and existing facts and circumstances  may adjust the consolidated balance of our allowance estimate  as appropriate 
our bad debt expense as a percentage of school revenue for the year ended december   was  relative to bad debt expense as a percentage of school revenue of for the year ended december   and bad debt expense as a percentage of school revenue of for the year ended december  the increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts of million in the fourth quarter of added to our year end bad debt percentage 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables as of december  and as of december   would have resulted in a change in net income of million during the years then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or institutions to participate in title iv programs  would have a material effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
contingencies we accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies  including  but not limited to  settlement of legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
effective january   pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
however  these assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
to date  no such events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
acquisitions all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  in connection with each acquisition  the purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values of all acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities as of the date of the acquisition 
as necessary  liabilities have been established at the acquisition dates to provide for restructuring liabilities and certain long term contractual obligations

depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million or  from million in  to million in  primarily as a result of depreciation expense recorded in connection with and capital expenditures 
income from operations 
income from operations during the years ended december   and  was as follows restated restated in thousands csu excluding share of affiliate earnings  which is included in csu s overall segment profit   oeg  corporate  eliminations  and other   total income from operations   income from operations increased million or  from million in  to million in approximately million  or percentage points of the total increase  is attributable to the growth of oeg operating income  and approximately million or percentage points of the total increase is attributable to an increase in csu operating income 
increases in csu and oeg income from operations were offset  in part  by an increase in net unallocated corporate expenses of approximately million  which accounted for percentage points of the total operating income change 
interest income 
interest income increased million or  from million in  to million in  due primarily to an increase in average daily cash balances available for short term investment purposes 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million or  from million in  to million in  due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate paid on revolving borrowings under our credit agreements  and a decrease in our average capital lease obligations  offset  in part  by an increase in average revolving borrowings during under our credit agreements 
share of affiliate earnings 
share of affiliate earnings from our minority interest in au dubai  which is included in the overall segment profit of our csu segment  increased million or  from million in  to million in miscellaneous income expense 
miscellaneous income expense increased million  from million in  to million in  primarily due to gains recorded on foreign currency exchange transactions in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million or  from million in  to million in  primarily as a result of an increase in pretax income during of million  offset  in part  by a reduction of our effective income tax rate from in  to in the decrease in our effective tax rate is attributable to the impact of various tax planning strategies and favorable changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
net income 
net income increased million or  from million in to million in  due to the cumulative effect of the factors noted above 
seasonality our results of operations fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment at our campuses 
our institutions experience a seasonal increase in new enrollments in the fall  traditionally when the largest number of new high school graduates begins postsecondary education 
furthermore  although we encourage year round attendance at all campuses  certain of our programs at certain schools include summer breaks 
as a result of these factors  total student enrollment and revenue are typically highest in the fourth quarter october through december and lowest in the second quarter april through june 
however  our costs and expenses do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis  except for admissions and advertising costs  which are typically higher during the second quarter and third quarter in support of seasonally high enrollments 
we anticipate that these seasonal trends will continue 
liquidity and capital resources overview 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  our cash flows from operations have historically been adequate relative to our liquidity requirements 
we finance our operating activities and our organic growth primarily through cash generated from operations 
we finance acquisitions primarily through funding from a combination of equity issuances  credit facility borrowings  and cash generated from operations 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements of our ongoing business for the foreseeable future primarily with cash generated by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreements 
our primary source of cash is tuition collected from our students 
our students finance tuition costs through the use of a variety of fund sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
during the years ended december    and  tuition payments received by our us institutions by primary fund source as a percentage of total tuition payments received by our us institutions was as follows for the year ended december  title iv funding stafford loans grants plus loans total title iv funding private loans non recourse loans sallie mae and wachovia recourse loans stillwater recourse loans total private loans scholarships  grants and other cash payments total tuition receipts title iv funding 
stafford loans are loans made directly to our students by financial institutions that participate in the ffel program 
there are two types of stafford loans subsidized and unsubsidized 
students who have a demonstrated financial need are eligible to receive a subsidized stafford loan  with the ed paying the interest on this loan while the student is in school and during the first six months after leaving school 
students without a demonstrated financial need are eligible to receive an unsubsidized stafford loan 
the student is responsible for paying the interest on an unsubsidized stafford loan while in school and after leaving school 
students who are eligible for a subsidized stafford loan may also receive an unsubsidized stafford loan 
a student is not required to meet any specific credit criteria to receive a stafford loan  but any student with a prior stafford loan default  or who has been convicted under federal or state law of selling or possessing drugs  will not be eligible for a stafford loan 
the ed has established maximum annual limits on the amount of stafford loans that students may borrow  and these annual limits are generally less than the tuition costs at our us institutions 
title iv program grants are grants made to our students under the pell and fseog programs 
the ed makes pell grants to students who demonstrate financial need up to a maximum amount of  per award year 
fseog awards are designed to supplement pell grants for the neediest students up to a maximum amount of  per award year 
a plus loan is a loan made directly by financial institutions to the parents of our students 
parents who have an acceptable credit history can borrow under a plus loan to pay the educational expenses of a child who is a dependent student enrolled at least half time at our us institutions 
the amount of a plus loan cannot exceed the student s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received 
as the stafford loan limits are generally significantly less than the tuition costs at our us institutions  many of our students have been obtaining private loans to finance the remainder of their tuition costs 
these private loans are made directly to our students by financial institutions and are not guaranteed under the ffel program 
two types of private loans are available to our students non recourse loans and recourse loans 
the ed requires that we keep unbilled title iv program funds that are collected in separate cash accounts until the students are billed for the program portion related to those title iv program funds 
in addition  all funds transferred to our schools through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account until certain conditions are satisfied 
as of december   the balance of such funds held in separate cash accounts was not significant 
the restrictions on any cash held in these accounts have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 
non recourse loans 
a financial institution providing a non recourse loan assumes of the credit risk on the loan 
to receive a non recourse loan  the student  or the student and a co borrower  must meet the credit criteria established by the financial institution for these loans 
each financial institution has established its respective credit criteria and loan limits 
students and co borrowers can generally borrow an amount equal to the student s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received 
the majority of non recourse private loans received by our students at our us institutions during were provided by sallie mae 
recourse loan agreements 
we have entered into agreements with wachovia bank wachovia  sallie mae  and stillwater national bank and trust company stillwater to provide private recourse loans to qualifying students 
eligibility for each program is based primarily upon the student s credit rating 
the type of private loan for which a student is eligible provides additional information for a school to assess a particular student s creditworthiness 
under our recourse loan agreement with sallie mae  we are required to deposit of all recourse loans funded under the agreement into a sallie mae reserve account 
the agreement provides for a million recourse loan funding limit 
the agreement was effective as of july   and expires after the million recourse loan funding limit has been reached or june   whichever occurs first 
recourse loans funded under this agreement are intended for students whose credit scores are less than the credit score required under sallie mae s non recourse loan program 
a student is generally eligible for a sallie mae recourse loan if the student demonstrates a specified minimum credit score  any bankruptcy proceeding involving the student has been discharged for at least months  and the student is not in default or delinquent with respect to any prior student loan 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to purchase  with funds that have been deposited into the reserve account referenced above  recourse loans funded under the agreement that have been delinquent for days or upon the bankruptcy  death  or total and permanent disability of the borrower 
the amount of our repurchase obligation may not exceed the of loans funded under the agreement and that amount is withheld by sallie mae and deposited into the reserve account 
any balance remaining in the reserve account after all recourse loans have been either repaid in full or repurchased by us will be paid to us 
the disbursed amount of loans funded as of december   exceeded our original funding limit with sallie mae  and we are currently in negotiations with sallie mae to extend our existing recourse loan agreement 
during these ongoing negotiations  sallie mae has agreed to continue funding additional recourse loans in excess of the original funding limit under the terms of the agreement 
as of december   approximately million had been disbursed to our students 
additionally  as of december   we had purchased loans in default with a principal balance  plus accrued interest  of approximately million  and  thus  based on the volume of total loans funded through december   we may be required to purchase additional defaulted loans totaling approximately million with funds currently deposited in the reserve account 
our recourse loan agreement with wachovia expired in june and was not renewed 
the agreement  which required us to deposit of each loan funded under the agreement into a wachovia reserve account  contained no provision with respect to the maximum annual or cumulative amount of recourse loans that wachovia would provide to our qualifying students during the term of the agreement 
recourse loans funded under this agreement were intended for students whose credit scores were less than the credit score required under wachovia s non recourse loan program 
a student was generally eligible for a recourse loan if the student demonstrated a specified minimum credit score  had not filed for bankruptcy within the preceding four years  and was not in default or delinquent with respect to any prior student loan 
under the terms of the agreement  we were obligated to purchase  with funds that were deposited by us into the reserve account referenced above  recourse loans funded under the agreement that had been in default  as defined  for days 
the amount of our repurchase obligation may not exceed the of loans funded under the agreement that was deposited by us into the reserve account 
any balance remaining in the reserve account ninety six months from the end of the year that the loans were disbursed will be paid to us 
during the term of the loan agreement  recourse loans of approximately million were funded 
as of december   we had purchased loans in default with a principal balance of approximately million 
as of december   the reserve account had a negligible balance  and thus  we have no significant obligation to purchase additional loans 
on december   we entered into an agreement with stillwater to purchase certain private student loans originated by stillwater and serviced by sallie mae 
the private student loans subject to this purchase agreement are made by stillwater to students at our schools if the student demonstrated a specified minimum credit score  which is less than the minimum credit score required pursuant to our recourse loan agreement with sallie mae  had not filed for bankruptcy within the preceding four years  and was not in default or delinquent with respect to any prior student loan 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  stillwater retains of the loan amounts disbursed and deposits this amount into a reserve account 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  stillwater has an option  but not an obligation  to sell to us these private student loans on a monthly basis 
we are required to purchase all private student loans offered for sale by stillwater for a price equal to the current principal balance plus accrued interest 
upon purchase of private student loans from stillwater  we receive all funds that were placed into the reserve account with respect to the specific loans purchased 
as of december   loans totaling approximately million had been funded by stillwater under the agreement 
as of december   we had repurchased private student loans funded under this agreement with a principal balance  plus accrued interest  of approximately million  against which an allowance of million had been established 
thus  based on the volume of total loans funded through december   we may be required to purchase additional loans of approximately million  half of which would be financed with funds currently deposited in the reserve account 
recourse loan funds withheld by the lender or deposited by us pursuant to our recourse loan agreements are recorded as deposits within other long term assets on our balance sheet 
these amounts may ultimately be utilized to purchase recourse loans  in which case recoverability of such amounts would be in question 
therefore  we establish a reserve against recourse funds on deposit through the use of a deposit contra account 
the expense is recognized as the related revenues are earned on a straight line basis over the course of the instructional term for which the underlying recourse loan was granted 
upon purchasing sallie mae and wachovia recourse loans in default  we transfer an amount equivalent to the principal balance of the loans purchased from the deposit account to a long term recourse loan receivable account and transfer an offsetting amount from the deposit contra account to the long term recourse loan receivable contra account  such that the net book value of the purchased loans is zero 
we believe that costs associated with our sallie mae and wachovia recourse loan programs are directly attributable to the educational activity of our schools and the support of our students 
therefore  such costs are classified as educational services and facilities expense within our statement of income 
upon purchasing stillwater recourse loans  of which is financed by deposits held in the reserve account  we record the principal balance of the loans as a long term recourse loan receivable and transfer the reserve for recourse loans withheld by the lender  totaling of the loan principal balance  from the deposit contra account to the long term loan receivable contra account  such that the net book value of the purchased loans is of the related principal balance 
based on our collections experience  we believe that a reserve is reasonable to provide for amounts pursuant to stillwater recourse loans that have been purchased  or may be purchased  and that may be ultimately uncollectible 
we periodically evaluate the collectibility and will modify our reserve for these loans in future periods  as appropriate 
reserves for uncollectible stillwater loans are charged to revenue due to the high level of uncollectible amounts expected 
the private student loans subject to our purchase agreement with stillwater are made by stillwater to students at our schools whose credit scores are less than the minimum credit scores required pursuant to our recourse loan agreement with sallie mae 
given the relatively high risk nature of these loans  collection of such loans  which we may be required to repurchase  is less reasonably assured 
therefore  costs recognized in connection with this purchase agreement  which totaled million for the year ended december   has been recorded as a reduction of related revenues 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in net income of approximately million  after accounting for the restatement related to the change in our revenue recognition policy with respect to culinary and health education programs with externships  and a million decrease in net operating assets  excluding the tax benefit associated with option exercises  during relative to a million decrease in net operating assets during net receivables decreased million or  from million as of december   restated  to million as of december  net receivables as of december  and  restated  were and  restated  respectively  of total revenue for the years ended december  and  restated 
these changes in net receivables include amounts attributable to balances acquired in connection with acquisitions and certain other business combinations 
quarterly days sales outstanding dso were days as of december  this represents an eleven day decrease from dso as of december   of days  restated 
we calculate dso by dividing net receivables by quarterly average daily revenue 
quarterly average daily revenue is computed by dividing total quarterly revenue by the total number of days in the quarter 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables increased from as of december   restated  to as of december  the decrease in dso from december  to december  is attributable to strong cash collections and the increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in our allowance and in our allowance as a percentage of gross student receivables is primarily attributable to our change in estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts  as discussed above in change in accounting estimate 
accrued expenses increased million or  from million as of december   restated  to million as of december  the increase in accrued expenses is primarily attributable to the following increased advertising accruals as of december  related to our increased advertising spending in  accruals recorded in connection with our self insured employee health benefits plan  which commenced in  an increase in accrued payroll expenses related to headcount and salary increases during the year  and an increase in accrued legal and professional fees primarily attributable to the ongoing sec investigation  the investigation being conducted by a special committee of our board of directors  and shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits  offset  in part  by a decrease in our accrued tax liability  attributable to estimated income tax payments made during  and a reduction of our effective income tax rate from in to in deferred tuition revenue increased million or  from million as of december   restated  to million as of december  the increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to strong cash collections and an increase in student population as discussed in results of operations 
investing activities 
capital expenditures increased from million during  to million during capital expenditures during  which represented approximately of total revenue  included  among other things  investments in leasehold improvements in connection with new and expanded facilities  and capital equipment purchases necessitated by increasing student population 
approximately of our total capital expenditures were made in connection with expansion projects and information system improvements in support of current and anticipated growth 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately of total revenue during as additional schools are opened  student population increases  and current facilities and equipment are upgraded and expanded 
we finance capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operations 
on february   we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of formastrat sa and its subsidiaries  also known as the inseec group  for approximately million  including assumed debt of million and excluding estimated acquisition costs of approximately million  primarily with funds obtained under our us credit agreement 
on july   we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of whitman 
for approximately million  excluding estimated acquisition costs of approximately million 
the cash portion of the purchase price of approximately million and cash consideration paid to whitman option holders of approximately million was paid primarily with funds obtained under our us credit agreement 
whitman shareholders also received an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with the transaction 
on august   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of western for approximately million  excluding estimated acquisition costs of million  primarily with funds obtained under our us credit agreement 
during december  in connection with our acquisition of pennsylvania culinary institute  we recorded a million liability representing our preliminary estimate of the present value of rental payments due  beginning in  under a pre existing long term contractual obligation for which we will receive no future benefit 
in the fourth quarter of  upon the finalization of our purchase price allocation  we recorded a purchase accounting adjustment of million to reflect a change in our estimate of the liability existing as of the december  acquisition date and increased the carrying value of the liability to million 
in december  we settled the liability for approximately million  which resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately million 
the liability was paid in december  and no additional obligation exists as of december  financing activities and capital resources 
on december   we entered into an unsecured credit agreement the us credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions  represented by  among others  an administrative agent 
under our current us credit agreement  we may borrow up to the us dollar equivalent of million in us dollars and various foreign currencies under a revolving credit facility and obtain up to the us dollar equivalent of million in standby letters of credit in us dollars and various foreign currencies 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
at any time during the three year period after december   provided no default under the us credit agreement then exists and subject to adequate subscription fulfillment  we may  upon notice to  but without the consent of  the administrative agent and the lenders  increase the revolving credit facility under our us credit agreement up to the us dollar equivalent of million

approximately million of this borrowing was repaid during the second quarter of the notional amount of the interest rate swap  originally million  decreased to million on december   will continue to decrease by million every three months through march   expiration date

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r will provide investors and other users of financial information with more complete and neutral financial information by requiring that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r replaces fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion  and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement of cash flows 
sfas  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  sfas permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
public entities  other than those filing as small business issuers  will be required to apply sfas r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  companies must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate the future income tax benefits of stock option exercises  as they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
accreditation and regulatory matters the following is an update on recent accreditation and regulatory actions at certain of our institutions 
le cordon bleu college of culinary arts atlanta lcb atlanta 
in a letter dated march   lcb atlanta was directed by the accrediting commission of career schools and colleges of technology accsct to show cause why its accreditation should not be withdrawn on the basis of lcb atlanta s untimely filing of a program advisory committee report requested by accsct 
specifically  lcb atlanta failed to submit the required report prior to accsct s february commission meeting 
lcb atlanta subsequently provided the program advisory committee report on february   which submission was acknowledged by accsct in its march  letter 
accsct will consider lcb atlanta s response to the show cause directive  including the previously requested program advisory committee report  at the may commission meeting 
american intercontinental university aiu 
as we previously reported  the commission on colleges of the southern associations of colleges and schools sacs placed aiu on warning status in june in december  aiu s accreditation was reaffirmed for the normal year period  through in the course of the accreditation process  sacs requested that aiu provide additional information on several compliance matters  with the expectation that those matters be addressed within a two year timeframe 
in placing aiu on warning status  sacs advised aiu that it had satisfactorily addressed a majority of those matters 
aiu was requested to satisfy the remaining compliance matters by december  the end of the two year period 
as requested by sacs  aiu submitted its report to sacs in september  and  on december   sacs provided written notification that aiu was removed from warning status 
in addition  sacs deferred consideration of substantive changes and authorized a sacs special committee to visit the institution 
the sacs special committee has been asked to visit aiu within the next months and evaluate the institution regarding certain of the sacs principles of accreditation 
sacs is also requesting a follow up report in september relating to institutional effectiveness 
to expand its presence in the texas market  aiu submitted substantive change applications to open additional campuses in san antonio and dallas in early the applications were approved by the division of universities and health related institutions of the texas higher education coordinating board thecb  but approval by sacs was deferred by sacs until its december meeting 
during its december meeting  sacs again deferred the applications until december  pending the outcome of the sacs special committee visit scheduled for brooks college 
as we previously reported  the accrediting commission for community and junior colleges of the western association of schools and colleges accjc advised brooks college that  following its re accreditation review  brooks was placed on probation in june as requested by accjc  brooks college provided accjc with a progress report in october to address certain matters 
accjc recently conducted a follow up visit to brooks college  and  at its january meeting  accjc continued the probation status for brooks college 
we regard the issues raised by accjc as serious and are working closely with brooks college to ensure that the accjc concerns are fully resolved 
brooks college is an entirely separate and distinct institution from brooks institute of photography 
although both schools are owned by us  they are separate entities with separate management and curricula and are separately licensed and accredited 
this matter affects both of brooks college s campuses  located in long beach and sunnyvale  california 
western school of health and business careers western 
as we previously reported  on march   western received notice from accsct that letters relied upon by us in our august acquisition of western to document accsct approval of certain of western s programs were not authentic 
as a result  accsct issued a show cause order directing western to explain the inauthentic letters  and indicating that western needed to secure approval of the affected diploma and degree programs 
western subsequently applied for approval of all of the affected programs  and accsct  in early june  issued approval for the diploma programs 
on july   accsct approved the degree programs contingent upon western s satisfaction of several stipulations 
western has satisfied these stipulations to the satisfaction of accsct  and accsct has approved the degree programs effective as of august  western has resumed marketing  new enrollments  and disbursement of title iv program aid to students in the diploma and degree programs 
western was removed from show cause by accsct in december  for information regarding a related lawsuit filed by us against the former owners of western  see item legal proceedings action against former owners of western school of health and business careers in this annual report on form k 
sanford brown institute  white plains  new york sbi 
the accrediting bureau of health education schools abhes conducted an unannounced visit to sbi in february following our acquisition of the campus 
a follow up focus visit was made in march because of the issues raised during the february and march visits  and sbi s plan to relocate to new facilities in july  abhes conducted an additional site visit to sbi in september in october  abhes notified sbi that as a result of concerns identified during the september site visit  sbi was directed to show cause as to why its current grant of accreditation should not be withdrawn 
in november  sbi submitted a timely response to the show cause directive and appeared before abhes in december to address any questions 
sbi continues to be on show cause with abhes 
this matter also affects sbi s branch campus located in springfield  massachusetts 
gibbs college livingston and katharine gibbs school piscataway 
the gibbs college livingston and katharine gibbs school piscataway campuses have been a candidate for regional accreditation with the middle states commission on higher education since november the campuses are required to show cause at a site visit by middle states in april as to why their regional accreditation candidacy should continue 
since the regional accreditor is not the campuses primary accreditor  the only effect of the show cause is to determine whether or not the two campuses will be allowed to continue to pursue initial regional accreditation with middle states 
we cannot predict the outcome of these accreditation actions  and any unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
risks related to our business the following risks  uncertainties  and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
failure to comply with extensive regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business failure of our us institutions to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for school operations could result in financial penalties  restrictions on our operations  loss of external financial aid funding for our students  or loss of our authorization to operate our schools 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from students participating in us federal student financial aid programs administered by the ed 
for these programs to be available to its students  a us institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies  accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ed  and certification by the ed 
as a result  our us institutions are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies 
these regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing and recruiting  financial operations  payment of refunds to students who withdraw  acquisitions or opening of additional schools  addition of new educational programs  and changes in our corporate structure and ownership 
the agencies that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one of our institutions were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  we could suffer a financial penalty 
a regulatory agency could also place limitations on our schools operations or terminate our schools ability to grant degrees and certificates or their eligibility to receive federal student financial aid funds on behalf of their students 
a significant portion of our students rely on federal student financial aid funds to finance their education 
we cannot predict with certainty how all of these requirements will be applied  or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future 
we have described some of the most significant regulatory requirements and risks that apply to our us schools in the following paragraphs 
even if we are complying with applicable governmental and accrediting body requirements  increased regulatory scrutiny or adverse publicity arising from allegations of non compliance may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our financial results  growth rates  and prospects 
please also see business financial aid and regulation for more detailed information on the regulatory requirements that apply to us 
the us congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs  which could harm our student population and revenue 
the us congress periodically reviews and revises the higher education act and other laws governing the federal student financial aid programs and annually determines the funding level for each of these programs 
during  congress is expected to devote significant attention to reauthorizing the higher education act  which will likely result in numerous legislative changes 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with applicable requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
if we or our schools do not meet ed s financial responsibility standards  our schools may be required to post a letter of credit and our participation in federal student financial aid programs could be limited  which could harm our net income and student population 
to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  an institution must meet general standards of financial responsibility and either meet specific numeric measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the ed or post a letter of credit in favor of the ed and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs 
currently  none of our schools is required to post a letter of credit in favor of the ed or accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs due to failure to satisfy the numeric measures of financial responsibility 
if  however  we or our institutions fail to satisfy the numeric standards in the future  any required letter of credit  if obtainable  and any limitations on our participation in the federal student financial aid programs could adversely affect our net income and student population 
our inability to obtain a required letter of credit could also adversely affect our net income and student population 
under a separate requirement  an institution must post a letter of credit if it makes more than a certain proportion of student refunds beyond the regulatory time period 
fourteen of our institutions have outstanding letters of credit in favor of the ed in the amount of million due to late student refunds 
our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if their student loan default rates are too high  which could harm our student population and revenue 
our schools may lose their eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by their students on their federal student loans equal or exceed specified rates 
if any of our schools  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs because of high student loan default rates  that loss could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs is too high  which could harm our student population and revenue 
a proprietary institution loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if it derives more than of its revenue from these programs in any fiscal year 
if any of our schools  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs because it exceeded this threshold  that loss could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
if regulators do not approve our acquisition of schools from third parties  the acquired schools would not be permitted to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
when we acquire a school  the ed and most applicable state authorizing agencies and accrediting agencies consider that a change of ownership or control of the institution has occurred 
a change of ownership or control of a school under the standards of the ed may result in the temporary suspension of the school s participation in the federal student financial aid programs until the ed issues a temporary certification document 
if we were unable to promptly reestablish the state authorization  accreditation or ed certification of a school we acquired  depending on the size of that acquisition  that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control or change in our corporate structure  we may lose our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
if we experience a change of control under the standards of the ed  applicable state agencies or accrediting agencies  we or the schools governed by such agencies must seek the approval of the relevant agencies 
some of these transactions or events  such as a significant acquisition of our common stock  may be beyond our control 
the failure of any of our schools to timely reestablish its state authorization  accreditation or ed certification following a change in ownership or control would result in a suspension or loss of federal student financial aid funding  which could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
the adverse regulatory effect of a change of ownership or control could also negatively impact bids for our outstanding shares of common stock 
if our schools do not maintain their state authorizations and accreditations  they may not operate or participate in federal student financial aid programs 
a school that grants degrees  diplomas  or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and  in some cases  other states where the school is deemed to be operating 
state authorization and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ed also are required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
requirements for state authorization and accreditation vary substantially among the applicable agencies  and some of our schools must satisfy highly detailed standards regarding their educational programs  facilities  faculty  and other matters to maintain the necessary approvals 
loss of state authorization or accreditation by any of our campuses  depending on the size of the campus  could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
we are subject to sanctions if we pay impermissible commissions  bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in certain recruiting  admissions or financial aid activities 
an institution participating in title iv programs may not provide any commission  bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions regarding the awarding of title iv program funds 
the law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances 
if the ed determined that an institution s compensation practices violated these standards  the ed could subject the institution to monetary fines  penalties  or other sanctions 
any substantial fine or penalty or other sanction levied against one or more of our schools could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to satisfy the ed s administrative capability standards  our business could suffer 
ed regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in title iv programs 
these criteria relate to  among other things  institutional staffing  operational standards  timely submission of accurate reports and various procedural matters 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria  the ed may require the repayment of federal student financial aid funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of federal student financial aid funds to the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or limit  suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in federal student financial aid programs 
limited access to  or loss of  federal student financial aid funds by one or more of our schools due to their failure to demonstrate the requisite administrative capability could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
government and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews  bring claims or initiate litigation against us based on alleged violations of the extensive regulatory requirements 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we are subject to audits  compliance reviews  inquiries  complaints  investigations  claims of non compliance and lawsuits by federal and state governmental agencies  regulatory agencies  present and former students and employees  stockholders and other third parties  which may allege violations of any of the regulatory requirements applicable to us and our institutions 
if the results of any such claims or actions are unfavorable to us  we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines  operational limitations  loss of federal funding  injunctions  or other criminal or civil penalties  which could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition 
even if we adequately address issues raised by any such claims or actions  we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to do so 
investigations  claims and actions against other companies in our industry could adversely affect our business and stock price 
in  the operations of a number of companies in the for profit postsecondary education industry were subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
in some cases  allegations of wrongdoing have resulted in reviews or investigations by the justice department  the sec  the ed  state agencies  accrediting agencies and other entities 
these allegations  reviews and investigations of other companies and the accompanying adverse publicity could have a negative impact on the for profit postsecondary education industry as a whole  our business and the market price of our common stock 
budget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students  which could adversely effect our student population 
a significant number of states are facing budget constraints that are causing them to reduce state appropriations in a number of areas 
those states include california and others that provide financial aid to our students 
we expect that california and other states may decide to reduce the amount of state financial aid that they provide to students  but we cannot predict how significant any of these reductions will be or how long they will last 
if the level of state funding for our students decreases and our students are not able to secure alternative sources of funding  our student population could be adversely affected 
failure to comply with extensive canadian regulations could affect the ability of our canadian schools to participate in canadian financial aid programs 
we derive a majority of our canadian schools revenue from canadian governmental financial aid programs 
depending on their province of residence  canadian students may receive loans under the canada student loans program  the ontario student assistance program osap  or the quebec loans and bursaries program 
in addition  there are students attending our canadian schools who receive government sponsored financial assistance from provinces other than ontario and quebec 
our canadian schools must meet eligibility standards to administer these programs and must comply with extensive statutes  rules  regulations  and requirements 
each of our ontario schools will be required to share the cost of student loan defaults if defaults by its students on their osap loans exceed specified rates 
our international academy of design and technology and softtrain schools in toronto currently do not have a default rate that exceeds the applicable threshold of 
however  our international academy of design and technology school in ottawa had an overall default rate of in and has received a letter from the ontario ministry of training  colleges and universities indicating that it may have to share in the costs of defaults and post an additional bond with the ministry 
if our canadian schools cannot meet these and other eligibility standards or fail to comply with applicable requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our net income 
the canadian  ontario  and quebec governments continuously review the legislative  regulatory  and other requirements relating to student financial assistance programs due to political and budgetary pressures 
although we do not anticipate a significant reduction in the funding for these programs  any change that significantly reduces funding or the ability of our schools to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
our ability to conduct business in other foreign countries could be limited if government regulation increases or changes 
our schools in france  the united kingdom and the united arab emirates are subject to extensive local regulations and requirements 
if we are found to be in violation of local regulations  including licensing and accreditation requirements  we could be subject to civil sanctions  including monetary penalties 
additionally  we could be required to incur significant ongoing expenses to comply with these regulatory requirements or  conceivably  could be restricted or barred from providing educational services in that jurisdiction 
please also see business other international regulations for more information on the international regulations that apply to us 
risks specific to our business could have a material adverse effect on us we face litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we and some of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in numerous private securities class action and derivative lawsuits 
on june   an amended consolidated complaint captioned taubenfeld v 
career education corporation et al 
no 
cv  was filed in the united states court for the northern district of illinois  alleging that we made certain material misrepresentations and failed to disclose certain material facts about our condition and prospects 
in addition  between january  and november   three derivative actions were filed against some of our current and former directors and executive officers captioned mcsparran v 
john m 
larson  et al 
united states district court for the northern district of illinois  xiao qiong huang v 
john m 
larson et al 
circuit court of cook county  illinois  chancery division  and nicholas v 
dowdell  et al 
chancery court of new castle county  delaware 
the derivative actions generally allege breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  and breach of fiduciary duties for insider selling and misappropriation of information  essentially based on allegations of conduct similar to that complained of in the taubenfeld action 
our board of directors announced that it had formed a special committee to conduct an independent investigation of allegations of securities law violations made against us 
the special committee retained the law firm of mcdermott  will emery llp on july  to represent and assist it in its review 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the special committee investigation 
additionally  in the ordinary course of our business  we and our schools are subject to various other lawsuits  investigations and claims  covering a wide range of matters  including  but not limited to  claims involving students or graduates and routine employment matters 
it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
in  we incurred million pre tax related to legal and other professional service fees in connection with the ongoing sec investigation  the investigation being conducted by the special committee of our board of directors  and shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
we expect legal and other professional services fees to continue to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future as a result of these matters and others 
please also see item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k for more detailed information on these litigation risks 
we face government investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain government agencies are conducting investigations regarding us 
as discussed above  the sec is currently conducting a formal investigation of us 
in addition  as a result of our inquiry to the justice department  we were advised that it is also conducting an investigation concerning us 
while we continue in our efforts to cooperate with and respond to requests for information from the sec  we cannot predict the outcome of the sec or justice department investigations 
there can also be no assurance that the scope of the sec or justice department investigations will not expand or that other regulatory agencies will not become involved 
the outcome and costs associated with the sec and justice department investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation  and the investigations could result in adverse publicity and divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations 
the sec and justice department investigations and any related legal and administrative proceedings could also include the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings against us and or our current or former officers or employees  the imposition of fines and penalties  suspensions and or other remedies and sanctions 
it is also possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
please also see item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k for more information on these matters 
we are undergoing a review of our prior periodic reports by the sec s division of corporation finance  which could result in the need for us to amend or restate our prior periodic reports or financial statements  or the financial statements included in this report 
the sec s division of corporation finance is undergoing a review of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and subsequent quarterly reports in among other things  the division of corporation finance has inquired about our accounting for the change in our allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation change in accounting estimate 
we believe the accounting for our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial statements overall are presented fairly and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  we have not completed the review process with the division of corporation finance and cannot predict the timing or outcome of their review  and there is no assurance that such outcome will not necessitate amendments or restatements of our previously filed periodic reports or financial statements  or of the financial statements included in this report 
any amendment or restatement of our periodic reports or financial statements could result in further litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business 
if students fail to pay their outstanding balances  our business will be harmed 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
losses related to unpaid student balances in excess of the amounts we have reserved for bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to effectively identify  pursue  and integrate acquired schools could harm our business 
we expect to continue to rely on acquisitions as a key component of our growth 
from time to time  we engage in  and we are currently engaged in  evaluations of  and discussions with  possible acquisition candidates 
we may not continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to acquire any such schools on favorable terms 
in addition  we may incur debt to finance future acquisitions and or issue securities in connection with future acquisitions  which may dilute the holdings of our stockholders 
to the extent we continue to pursue acquisitions  our ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government investigations described above in the risk factor entitled we face government investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired schools into our operations profitably 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including the diversion of management s attention  difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired schools  adverse short term effects on reported operating results and possible loss of key employees 
continued growth through acquisition may also subject us to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities 
acquired schools may not enhance our business and  if we do not successfully address associated risks and uncertainties  may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our growth and ability to compete 
opening additional new schools and adding new services could be difficult for us 
we have also grown by opening new schools as additional branches of existing schools 
establishing new schools poses unique challenges and requires us to make investments in management  capital expenditures  marketing expenses  and other resources different  and in some cases greater  than those required with respect to the operation of acquired schools 
when opening a new school  we may be required to obtain appropriate state or provincial or other international and accrediting agency approvals 
such approvals may be delayed or denied due to pending investigations or adverse publicity 
in addition  to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs  such a school has to be certified by the ed 
our failure to effectively manage the operations of newly established schools or service areas  or any diversion of management s attention from our core career oriented school operating activities  could harm our business 
risks specific to oeg s business could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our oeg segment intends to continue increasing the number of its students and more resources will be required to support this anticipated growth  including additional faculty  admissions  and academic and financial aid advisors 
this exceptional growth has placed  and future growth is expected to place  a significant strain on oeg s operational resources 
the continued development of awareness of the programs offered by oeg is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of oeg s programs 
if oeg is unable to continue to develop awareness of the programs offered by it  this could limit its enrollments and negatively impact its ability to increase revenues and profitability 
oeg s success depends in part on its ability to expand the content of its programs  develop new programs in a cost effective manner  maintain good standing with its regulators  and meet its students needs in a timely manner 
the expansion of oeg s existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by its students or the online education market and new programs could be delayed due to unforseen regulatory restrictions 
the performance and reliability of oeg s program infrastructure is critical to the reputation of oeg and its ability to attract and retain students 
any system error or failure  or a sudden and significant increase in traffic  may result in the unavailability of oeg s computer networks 
individual  sustained  or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of oeg and result in a loss of potential or existing students 
additionally  oeg s computer systems and operations are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond its control  including natural disasters and telecommunications failures 
any interruption to oeg s computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on the ability of oeg to attract and retain students 
oeg s computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hackers  computer viruses  and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations 
due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on oeg s networks  such as students grades  its networks may be targeted by hackers 
as a result  oeg may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our student population 
prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry level employees possess appropriate technological skills 
educational programs at our schools  particularly programs in visual communications and information technology  must keep pace with these evolving requirements 
if we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract students 
we compete with a variety of schools  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our student population and revenue could be harmed 
the postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive  while continuing to consolidate  with no single institution claiming a significant market share 
our schools compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities  other proprietary schools  including those that offer online education programs 
although tuition at private nonprofit institutions is  on average  higher than tuition at our campuses  some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition for courses of study similar to those offered by our institutions due  in part  to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions  and other financial resources not available to proprietary schools 
some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
we may incur increasing costs competing for students 
if we are not able to compete effectively for students  our revenue may decline 
expansion outside of the us  france  canada  the united kingdom  and the united arab emirates could adversely affect our business 
although we currently operate in the us  france  canada  the united kingdom  and the united arab emirates  we intend to explore opportunities outside those markets 
there may be difficulties and complexities associated with our expansion into these other international markets  and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets 
international operations present inherent risks  including currency fluctuations  varying political and economic conditions  unanticipated changes in regulation  trade barriers  staffing and management problems  and adverse tax consequences 
also  in further expanding internationally  we would be required to comply with different  and potentially more onerous  regulatory requirements 
if we do not effectively address these risks  our growth and ability to compete may be impaired 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce our ability to grow 
we believe that funds from operations  cash  investments  borrowings under our million us credit agreement  and borrowings under our million canadian credit agreement  will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out our strategy of growth through acquisitions 
we may also need additional debt or equity financing in the future to execute our growth strategy 
the amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the sellers willingness to provide financing 
to the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may not be able to fully implement our growth strategy 
our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions 
our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions  including paying dividends and disposing of assets 
accordingly  we may be restricted from taking actions which management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified financial tests 
a breach of any covenants contained in the credit agreement could result in an event of default under that agreement and allow the lenders to pursue various remedies  including accelerating the indebtedness outstanding thereunder  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
the loss of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success to date has depended  and will continue to depend  largely on the skills and efforts of john m 
larson  our chairman  president  and chief executive officer  patrick k 
pesch  our executive vice president  chief financial officer  treasurer  and secretary  steve c 
fireng  president of our online education group  jacob p 
gruver  group president of our college east  college west  and university divisions  kenneth d 
shore  group president of our gibbs division  paul r 
ryan  group president of our academy  culinary east  culinary west  health education east  and health education west divisions  todd h 
steele  group president of our international and startup divisions  steve b 
sotraidis  our executive vice president of administration  and our other key personnel 
our success also depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty  school presidents and administrators  and corporate management 
due to the nature of our business  we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel and retaining such personnel once hired 
none of our employees is subject to an employment or non competition agreement other than mr 
larson 
we do not maintain life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  a limited number of our faculty members are represented by unions  although they are not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements 
if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements  our flexibility in making human resources decisions could be impaired 
terrorist attacks and other acts of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the us and world economies and may disrupt our provision of educational services 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  such as those that took place on september   could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or its businesses or interests 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact our physical facilities or ability to recruit foreign students could significantly affect our ability to provide educational services to our students and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results 
further  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us and world economies could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
finally  further terrorist acts could cause the united states to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further impact our operations and result in prospective students  as well as our current students and employees  entering the armed forces 
these factors could cause significant declines in our enrollment and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law and our stockholders rights plan could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that may delay  defer  or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with such voting  conversion  and other rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions as it determines  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms 
we are also subject to the provisions of delaware law that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of our company 
one of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless specified conditions are satisfied 
we have also implemented a stockholders rights plan  also commonly called a poison pill  that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquirer from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business 
we have grown rapidly since our incorporation in january our continued rapid growth may place a strain on our management  operations  employees  or resources 
we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate  effectively manage our expanding operations  or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may experience operating inefficiencies  and our net income may be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we may use derivative financial instruments for the express purpose of mitigating our exposure to these risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate exposure 
our borrowings under our credit agreements bear annual interest at variable rates tied to the prime rate and the eurocurrency rate 
the outstanding borrowings under these credit agreements were million and million at december  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix at the variable portion of the rate of interest payable by us on a certain portion of million  borrowed during under our us credit agreement to finance our acquisition of the inseec group 
approximately million of this borrowing was repaid during the second quarter of the notional amount of the interest rate swap  originally million  decreased to million on december   will continue to decrease by million every three months through its march   expiration date 
the impact of the interest rate swap agreement on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows during the year ended december   was not significant 
the weighted average annual interest rate of borrowings under our credit agreements  including the effect of the interest rate swap agreement  was and as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  we had capital lease obligations totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
we estimate that the book value of our debt instruments and related derivative financial instruments approximated their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries use functional currencies other than the us dollar 
we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar  the euro  and the british pound vis vis the us dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of december   is not significant  and the book values of the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations as of december   approximated their fair values 
as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under our us credit agreement of million denominated as million and borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit agreement of million denominated in million canadian 
we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not significant
