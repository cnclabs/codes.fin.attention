item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during fiscal  the company decided to discontinue and dispose of its aircraft component parts brokerage and repair services business operated by its mountain aircraft services  llc mas subsidiary and  accordingly  the company s fiscal and consolidated financial statements reflect the results of mas as a discontinued operation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  the company completed the sale of certain assets of mas and entered into a three year consignment agreement granting the buyer an exclusive right to sell the majority of the remaining mas inventory included in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of that date 
consequently  mas s operations are not included in the fiscal and results of continuing operations discussed below 
overview the company s continuing operations operate in two business segments  providing overnight air cargo services to the express delivery services industry and aviation ground support and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the military and industrial customers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company s air cargo operations  which are comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc 
csa subsidiaries  accounted for of revenue in fiscal the company s ground support operations  comprised of its global ground support  llc subsidiary  global  accounted for the remaining of revenues 
mac and csa are short haul express air freight carriers and provide air cargo services exclusively to one customer  federal express corporation federal express  although they are not contractually precluded from providing such services to other firms  and have done so in the past 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company receives an administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated in revenue service and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance rev enue  at cost 
these agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by federal express at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with federal express are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
loss of its contracts with federal express would have a material adverse effect on the company 
separate agreements cover the five types of aircraft operated by mac and csa for federal express cessna caravan  atr  atr  fokker f  and short brothers sd cessna caravan  atr  atr and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from federal express  and short brothers sd aircraft two aircraft at march  are owned by the company and operated periodically under wet lease arrangements with the federal express 
pursuant to such agreements  federal express determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
the air cargo segment s financial results in fiscal were affected by federal express s decision to modernize the aircraft fleet being operated by mac under dry lease agreements by replacing older fokker f aircraft with newer atr and atr aircraft 
mac s fiscal administrative fees which are based on the number of aircraft operated in active or stand by service were adversely affected as a result of delays in the introduction of newer atr aircraft which were not received in time to replace the older fokker f aircraft that were removed from service as they neared major scheduled maintenance 
f revenue routes  affected by the delayed introduction of the atr s  were temporarily flown by standby mac and csa aircraft or wet lease aircraft 
in addition  the company incurred increased administrative cost s in fiscal as additional staffing was put in place to oversee the phase in and operation of the newer aircraft and restructure of the route system 
mac has been engaged to assist in the certification and conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration and these conversion activities have resulted in increased maintenance revenue  a portion of which represents cost of aircraft parts  billed to the customer without mark up 
mac and csa s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year increase of 
approximately  or of the increase in revenue in fiscal was related to maintenance services and acquisition of aircraft parts  which were primarily attributed to customer fleet modernization  associated with conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration  and route expansion 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to administration and other direct operating revenue associated with route expansion 
global manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and ground support equipment and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and in june global was awarded a three year extension of that contract 
in fiscal  revenues from sales to the air force accounted for approximately of the ground equipment segment s revenue 
global s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year increase of 
the increase in revenues in was primarily due to increased military and commercial equipment orders  offset  in part  by the fiscal completion of a large scale airport deicer system contract 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s operating expenses for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenue in thousands expense as a percent of revenue flight operations maintenance ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses the company incurred greater professional fees in fiscal than in fiscal due to the additional requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the company anticipates that as additional requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of become applicable to the company  in particular the requirements under section b of that act with respect to auditor attestation with respect to internal controls which provision is scheduled to apply to the company in fiscal  professional fees will continue to increase and may materially adversely affect the company s net income 
outlook the company s current forecast for fiscal suggests that  due to higher fuel cost and continuing losses sustained by passenger airlines since september  the commercial aviation market will grow at a rate that is substantially less than the rest of the economy 
increased military and homeland security budgets  pending funding approvals  and increased activity by outside service providers which have taken over the deicing responsibilities of several airlines and airports may help offset the expected lower than normal order levels from commercial customers 
company management currently anticipates that its air cargo segment will continue to benefit from its customer s aircraft fleet modernization and route expansion through fiscal however  given the uncertainties associated with the above fac tors  the company continues to operate in a highly unpredictable environment 
based on the current general economic and industry outlook and cost cutting measures implemented over the past thirty six months  the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and funds available from current and renewed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and anticipated working capital requirements through fiscal if these sources are inadequate or become unavailable  then the company may pursue additional funds through the financing of unencumbered assets or sale of equity securities  although there is no assurance these additional funds will be sufficient to replace the sources that are inadequate or become unavailable 
actual results for fiscal will depend upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including  in part  the timing of receipt of the remaining replacement atr aircraft  the timing  speed and magnitude of the economic recovery of the aviation industry  military funding of pending future equipment orders  future levels of commercial aviation capital spending  future terrorists acts and weather patterns 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the most significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  warranty reserves  deferred tax asset valuation  retirement benefit ob ligations  valuation of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method and valuation of long lived assets 
following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and related management estimates and assumptions 
a full description of all significant accounting policies is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  was established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports  customer financial condition and the collectability of outstanding accounts receivables associated with the discontinued operations of mas 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  are based on assessment of the marketability of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
during fiscal the company wrote down the gross value of the mas inventory held for sale by  the value of the inventory s obsolescence reserve prior to the write down 
historical part usage  current period sales  estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  existing supplies of used inventory available for sale  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry 
the company warranties its ground equipment products for up to a two year period from date of sale 
product warranty reserves are recorded at time of sale based on the historical average warranty cost and are adjusted as actual warranty cost becomes known 
as of march  the company s warranty reserve amounted to  product warrant reserve activity during fiscal and fiscal is as follows balance at additions to reserve use of reserve balance at additions to reserve use of reserve balance at deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  net of valuation allowance in the amount of  and  in fiscal and  reflect the likelihood of the recoverability of these assets 
company judgment of the recoverability of these assets is based primarily on estimates of current and expected future earnings and tax planning 
retirement benefits obligation 
the company currently determines the value of retirement benefits assets and liabilities on an actuarial basis using a discount rate 
long term deferred retirement benefit obligations amounted to  and  respectively  in fiscal and values are affected by current independent indices  which estimate the expected return on insurance policies and the discount rates used 
changes in the discount rate used will affect the amount of pension liability as well as pension gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income 
in  the compensation committee of the board of directors confirmed the level of retirement benefits under existing agreements for certain executive officers at amounts approximately  less than had been previously accrued 
based on an estimated average term to retirement of these officers of four years  the accrual was reduced by  in fiscal  and similar reduction would occur in the next three fiscal years 
the reduction in the accrual reduced general and administrative expense by that amount 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms and maintenance revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and title has passed to customers 
revenues from overhaul contracts on customer owned parts  certain labor service contracts and long term fixed price manufacturing projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts under percentage of completion amounted to and  respectively  in fiscal and revenues are measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date  to estimated total cost for each contract or work order  unanticipated changes in job performance  job conditions and estima ted profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company assesses long lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
in the event it is determined that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of the fair value of those assets  the company then will write down the value of the assets to fair value 
the company has applied the discontinued operations provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for the mas o perations and has reflected any remaining long lived assets associated with the discontinued mas subsidiary at zero fair market value at march  resignation of executive officer effective december   an executive officer and director of the company resigned his employment 
in consideration of approximately  payable in three installments over a one year period starting january   the executive agreed to forgo certain retirement and other contractual benefits for which the company had previously accrued aggregate liabilities of  the company has accounted for the resignation as a settlement under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit plans and for termination benefits 
the above mentioned cancellation of contractual retirement benefits reduced fiscal recorded liabilities by  the difference between the recorded liability and ultimate cash payment of  resulted in the recording of a  reduction in actuarial losses  recorded in other comprehensive loss  a  reduction in intangible assets and a net  reduction in executive compensation charges included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the company also agreed to purchase from the former executive officer  shares of airt common stock held by him representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock at december  for per share of the january  closing price 
the stock repurchase took place in three installments over a one year period  starting january   and totaled approximately  the repurchase of the former executive s stock was recorded in the period that the repurchase occurred 
as of march  all payments required to be made under the above agreements had been made 
seasonality global s business has historically been highly seasonal 
due to the nature of its product line  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and in june global was awarded a three year extension on the contract 
in january and march global received two large scale  fixed stand deicer contracts  which the company believes contributed to management s plan to reduce seasonal fluctuation in revenues during fiscal and however  as these contracts are completed  seasonal trends for global s business may resume 
the remainder of the company s business is not materially seasonal 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from continuing operations increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue primarily resulted from an increase in global revenue of  to  combined with a  increase in air cargo revenue to  in fiscal  as described in overview above 
operating expenses from continuing operations increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the net increase in operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations increased  primarily as a result of increased direct operating costs  including pilot salaries  fuel  airport fees  and costs associated with pilot travel  due to increased cost of oil  flight schedule changes and increased administrative staffing due to fleet modernization and route expansion programs  maintenance expenses increased  primarily as a result of increases in cost of parts  maintenance personnel  travel  contract services and outside maintenance related to customer fleet modernization and route expansion  ground equipment costs increased   as a result of increased cost of parts and supplies and support personnel related to increased customer orders  depreciation and amortization increased  as a result of purchases of capital assets  general and administra tive expense increased  primarily as a result of increased corporate aircraft costs  professional fees  telephone costs  and staffing  offset by decreased profit sharing provision due to management changes

operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the net decrease in air cargo operating income was due to a combination of temporarily decreased administrative fees which resulted from delays in the introduction of replacement atr aircraft  currently undergoing conversion to cargo configuration  as older cargo aircraft are phased out of service  and higher levels of current period administrative costs as additional staffing has been put in place to oversee the phase in and operations of the newer aircraft and route restructuring 
earnings from continuing operations in fiscal include  of residual cost related to the remaining mas parts inventory to be sold on consignment and cost of leased facilities previously operated by mas that the company has been unable to sublease 
non operating expense increased a net  primarily due to increased interest expenses related to acquisition of an aircraft 
provision for income taxes decreased  primarily due to decreased earnings 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended march  and were different from the federal statutory rates primarily due to state tax provisions and  to a lesser extent  permanent tax differences

on a continuing operations segment basis  significant impacts on the company s operating results comparing the fiscal year ended march  to its prior fiscal year resulted from changes in both the ground equipment and air cargo sectors 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  compared to prior period income of  several factors contributed to the increases in global s operating results 
global s fiscal year operating income increased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to progress on a large scale airport contract completed in fiscal  higher sales volume due to increased delivery of units on its us air force contract and a increase in increased commercial equipment ord ers 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from  in the prior fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company s working capital amounted to  an increase of  compared to march  the net increase primarily resulted from increases in accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
in august  the company amended its  secured long term revolving credit line to extend its expiration date to august  in order to more closely match the credit line s limits to the company s financing needs  the credit line limits were amended to  from september  to december  and  from january  to expiration date 
the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
there is no requirement for the company to maintain a lock box arrangement under this agreement 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive cov enants 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions

in march  the company utilized its revolving credit line to acquire a corporate aircraft for  in april  the company refinanced the aircraft under a secured fixed rate five year term loan  based on a ten year amortization with a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year 
the company assumes various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of its operations and financing activities 
financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that the company is required to make under existing contractual arrangements such as debt and lease agreements 
the following table of material contractual commitments at march  summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods  as discussed below 
contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term bank debt operating leases capital leases deferred retirement obligation total the respective years ended march   and resulted in the following changes in cash flow operating activities provided   and  respectively in fiscal  and investing activities used  and  respectively  in fiscal and and provided  in fiscal and financing activities provided  in and used  and  respectively  in fiscal and net cash increased   and  respectively  in fiscal  and cash provided by operating activities was  more for the year ended march   compared to fiscal principally due to decreased inventory associated with equipment sales and increased accounts payable associated with increased production levels  partially offset by increased accounts receivable associated with increased air cargo billings and equipment sales 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was approximately  more than fiscal  principally due to proceeds from sale of assets associated with discontinued operations of  in  offset by increased capital expenditures relating to the  purchase of an airplane 
cash provided by financing activities was  more in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to the  increased borrowings on line of credit and  financing of an airplane offset by  payment of dividends in the current year  repurchase of common stock and an executive pension payment 
during the fiscal year ended march  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for  as described above  under resignation of executive officer 
there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may   the company declared that  due to losses sustained in fiscal  no common share dividend would be paid in fiscal on may   the company declared a per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  on may  the company declared a 
per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  derivative financial instruments as required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value 
the company is exposed to market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  the company may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
in may  the company entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  and million respectively 
these agreements were originally entered into at respective interest rates of and 
on july  the company elected to unwind its  revolving credit line swap in consideration for  the fair market value termination fee as of that date 
on october   the company terminated its remaining credit line swap for  the fair market value termination fee as of that date 
the  balance included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of march  will be ratably amortized into interest expense over the remaining original term of the company s cre dit line 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of march  the company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on certain portions of its line of credit  which bears interest based on the day libor rate plus basis points

as of march   has been reflected as current liability and  has been reflected as long term liability associated with this death benefit 
off balance sheet arrangements the company defines an off balance sheet arrangement as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of the arrangements defined above 
impact of inflation the company believes that  due to the currently low levels of inflation  the impact of inflation and changing prices on its revenues and net earnings will not have a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs can be passed on to its customers  or on its air cargo business since the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup  under current contract terms 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income

recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement amends apb to account for non monetary exchanges at fair value unless the exchanges do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the guidance is effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  safs no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july   using the modified prospective method allowed by the statement 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would not have been material
