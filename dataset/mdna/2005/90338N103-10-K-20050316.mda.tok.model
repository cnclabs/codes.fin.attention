item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are the fifth largest publicly traded truckload carrier in the united states  measured by revenue 
our primary business is offering a broad range of truckload services to customers throughout the united states and in portions of canada and mexico 
we also offer transportation  warehousing  and distribution services to the floorcovering industry and airport to airport transportation services to the airfreight and airfreight forwarding industries 
since becoming a public company  we have increased our operating revenue to billion in from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
our growth has come through expansion of business with new and existing customers  complementary acquisitions  and more recently  through the development and expansion of additional strategic business units 
we believe our emphasis on developing strategic business units focused on an expanded array of truckload services has accelerated our growth and profitability in recent periods 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition for the year ended december   our results of operations improved as follows versus the fiscal year revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to billion from million  net income increased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share increased to from 
we believe the improvements in our profitability were attributable primarily to the continued execution of our operating strategy  which involves allocating our truckload assets to business units with greater profitability and improving the profitability of each business unit 
our primary area of focus initially has been on improving our business units yield management and asset productivity 
we seek to do this by raising freight rates where justified and also replacing less profitable freight 
in this process  we evaluate rates  non revenue miles  miles per tractor  the total time our assets are committed to the freight movement  the efficiency of our equipment positioning before and after the movement  total costs associated with the movement  drivers domiciles and preferences  the overall customer relationship  and other factors 
based on our criteria  our sales and operations personnel work together to select more profitable freight 
our efforts were aided by stronger freight demand and a better rate environment in primarily due to continued growth in the us economy and a favorable relationship between demand and trucking capacity 
these factors contributed to higher average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  which increased to  in from  in  and a increase in average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge to from 
these factors more than offset a significant increase in costs  primarily attributable to increases in driver compensation  costs of revenue equipment  insurance and claims  and fuel 
at december   our balance sheet reflected stockholders equity of million and million in aggregate borrowings  including current maturities and the securitization facility 
during december  we completed a public offering of million of our class a common shares that generated approximately million in net proceeds to us 
we used our net proceeds to repay debt 
our future earnings per share will reflect the dilution from the additional shares outstanding from this offering 
our truckload segment our truckload segment  us xpress  which comprised approximately of our total operating revenue in  includes the following five strategic business units  each of which is significant in its market 
dedicated 
our approximately  tractor dedicated unit offers our customers dedicated equipment  drivers  and on site personnel to address customers needs for committed capacity and service levels  while affording us consistent equipment utilization during the contract term 
regional 
our approximately tractor regional unit offers our customers concentrated capacity and a high level of service in dense freight markets of the southeast  midwest  and west  while affording a lifestyle favored by many drivers 
expedited intermodal rail 
our railroad contracts for high speed train service enable us to provide our customers incremental capacity and transit times comparable to solo driver service in medium to long haul markets  while lowering our costs 
expedited team 
our approximately team driver unit offers our customers a service advantage over medium to long haul rail and solo driver truck service at a much lower cost than airfreight  while affording us premium rates and improved utilization of equipment 
medium to long haul solo 
our approximately  tractor solo driver unit offers our customers significant capacity and nationwide coverage 
over the past few years we have been reallocating our truckload assets to our more profitable business units 
this has resulted in significant growth in the percentage of our revenue contributed by dedicated  regional  and expedited intermodal rail services and a decrease in the percentage of our revenue contributed by medium to long haul solo service and  to a lesser extent  by expedited team service 
we believe the execution of this strategy has been a primary contributor to the improvements in our profitability since we initiated the process in in addition  the asset reallocation has affected the comparability of certain operating measures 
for example  we are generating higher average revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  offset by an increase in non revenue miles and a decrease in miles per tractor 
in general  shorter regional and dedicated hauls pay higher rates per mile but generate fewer miles per unit and involve a greater percentage of non revenue miles for re positioning the tractor for the next load 
also  our purchased transportation expense has increased significantly due to the growth of our expedited intermodal rail service  which involves the pass through of a portion of our freight revenue to the rail service provider 
our operating measures may continue to change as we continue to execute our strategy 
our xpress global systems segment our xpress global systems segment  which comprised of our total operating revenue in  offers transportation  warehousing  and distribution services to the floorcovering industry  as well as nationwide  scheduled ground transportation of air cargo to customers in the airfreight and airfreight forwarding industries as a cost effective and reliable alternative to traditional air transportation 
during  our xpress global systems segment experienced an operating loss of million  primarily because of lower than anticipated revenue  growth in fixed expenses  and higher transportation costs due to fuel prices and tight capacity within the truckload sector 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of shipments and miles we generate 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
our primary measures of revenue generation are average revenue per loaded mile and average revenue per tractor per week  in each case excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
average revenue per loaded mile  before fuel surcharge revenue  increased to in  from in  and in average revenue per tractor per week improved to  in  from  in  and  in the main factors that impact our profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and purchased transportation expenses  which include compensating independent contractors and providers of expedited intermodal rail services 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing costs  including depreciation  of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and terminal facilities and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
our operating ratio improved to in  from in  and in revenue equipment at december   we had a truckload fleet of  tractors  which included owner operator tractors 
we also operated  trailers in our truckload fleet and approximately tractors dedicated to local and drayage services 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total revenue  excluding fuel surcharge  for each of the fiscal years indicated below 
fuel surcharge revenue is offset against fuel and fuel taxes 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this source of revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits fuel and fuel taxes vehicle rents depreciation and amortization purchased transportation operating expense and supplies insurance premiums and claims operating taxes and licenses communications and utilities general and other operating expenses early extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased to billion from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge  and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to billion in compared to million in us xpress revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to an increase of in average revenue per loaded mile to from 
the increase in average revenue per loaded mile was primarily due to increased rates and from growth in regional and dedicated operations  which generally provide for a shorter length of haul and higher rate per mile 
xpress global systems revenue increased to million in compared to million in within xpress global systems  floorcovering revenue increased to million  due primarily to an increase in revenue per pound of  and airport to airport revenue increased to million  due primarily to revenue generated from acquisitions of airport to airport operations in july and october intersegment revenue decreased to million in compared to million in  due to xpress global systems increased use of third party carriers for truckload services combined with the introduction of owner operators to xpress global systems airport to airport operations 
salaries  wages and benefits increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to driver pay increases of approximately and in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively  an increase in the number of local drivers necessary to support our expedited intermodal rail program  and growth in non driver personnel as a result of the increased volume of business in both of our business segments 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  salaries  wages and benefits decreased to in  compared to in primarily due to the increase in average revenue per loaded mile which more than offset increases in driver and non driver compensation 
effective september   we increased our workers compensation retention level to  per occurrence compared to  per occurrence in the prior period  which could result in greater fluctuations in these expenses in future periods 
workers compensation premiums and claims expense are included in salaries  wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
fuel and fuel taxes  net of fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to an approximate increase in the average fuel price per gallon  combined with the lower fuel efficiency of the new epa compliant engines 
these factors were partially offset by collection of fuel surcharges and a decline in company miles 
our exposure to increases in fuel prices is predominately mitigated by fuel surcharges to its customers  which amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  fuel and fuel taxes  net of fuel surcharge  declined to in compared to in primarily because of the increase in average revenue per loaded mile  combined with an increase in the use of expedited intermodal rail for certain medium to long haul truckload freight 
vehicle rents decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of tractors financed under operating leases to  compared to  during and  respectively 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of trailers financed under operating leases to  compared to  during and  respectively  due to the expansion of our trailer fleet necessary to support the expedited intermodal rail program 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  vehicle rents were in compared to in primarily due to a larger portion of the fleet being financed through debt instead of operating leases  combined with an increase in average revenue per tractor  which more effectively covered this fixed cost 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of owned tractors and trailers to  and  respectively  in compared to  and  respectively  in  as well as increased cost of the new epa compliant engines and lower residual values 
the increased depreciation and amortization reflects our decision to finance our fleet additions with debt versus operating leases  combined with the expansion of our trailer fleet necessary to support the expedited intermodal rail program 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent at in compared to in despite the increase in tractors and trailers financed through debt instead of operating leases primarily due to the increase in average revenue per tractor  which more effectively covered this fixed cost 
purchased transportation increased to million in compared to million in primarily due to the increased use of expedited intermodal rail in the truckload segment for certain medium to long haul truckload freight and an owner operator pay increase of approximately initiated in february this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of owner operators in the truckload segment in to  or of the total fleet  compared to  or of the total fleet  in xpress global systems purchased transportation increased approximately due to higher line haul costs  resulting from higher fuel costs and tight capacity in the truckload industry and the introduction of owner operators to xpress global systems airport to airport operations 
xpress global systems number of owner operators was approximately at december  compared to none in as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  purchased transportation increased to in compared to in primarily due to the growth in the expedited intermodal rail program and increased line haul costs at xpress global systems  which more than offset a decline in the percentage of our tractor fleet being provided by owner operators and the increase in average revenue per loaded mile 
operating expense and supplies increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in driver recruiting and retention costs 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  operating expense and supplies were in compared to in as increases in average revenue per loaded mile and per tractor more than offset these increased costs 
insurance premiums and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability personal injury and property damage  physical damage and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher insurance premiums and a million increase in liability expense  primarily due to an approximate million increase in the provision for current year claims combined with an increase in adverse development related to prior year claims due in part to the settlement of certain large claims 
the increase in liability claims was partially offset by a decrease in physical damage and cargo claims 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  insurance and premiums and claims expense was in compared to in at december   the retention level for cargo loss was  and the retention level for liability was million per occurrence 
we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above amounts for which we are self insured for cargo and liability 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of pending claims  plus any incurred but not reported claims 
the accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and future development based on historical trends additionally  the results of a third party actuarial study were also utilized in establishing the december  liability reserve 
insurance premiums and claims expense will fluctuate based on claims experience  premium rates and self insurance retention levels 
interest expense decreased  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in average borrowings  combined with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to in compared to in see footnote  long term debt and footnote  accounts receivable securitization  of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year 
the rate is higher than the statutory rate of  primarily as a result of per diems paid to drivers which are not fully deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we initiated the per diem driver pay plan in february see footnote  income taxes  of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased to million for from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in us xpress revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to an increase of in average revenue per mile to from 
the increase in average revenue per mile is due to increased rates in over the road and team expedited operations and improved freight selection 
the effect of the increase in average revenue per mile was offset by a slight decrease in average revenue miles per tractor per period 
xpress global systems revenue increased to million in compared to million in within xpress global systems  floorcovering revenue increased to million  due to new and additional business with large floorcovering retailers and manufacturers combined with increased rates and an increase in airport to airport revenue of to million  due to continued penetration in the marketplace 
salaries  wages and benefits increased to in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in workers compensation claims combined with a growth in headcount to support the expansion of facilities and additional volume of business at xpress global systems 
as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages and benefits remained relatively consistent at in compared to in primarily due to the increase in average revenue per mile 
fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge  decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to improvements in the level of fuel surcharges billed to customers in fuel surcharge revenue was million in compared to million in the average fuel price per gallon increased approximately in compared to vehicle rents increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in the average number of tractors financed under operating leases to  compared to  in and  respectively 
we also experienced a slight increase in the average number of trailers leased in to  compared to  in as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  vehicle rents were in compared to in  primarily because a larger portion of the fleet was financed through the use of operating leases 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the increase in the ratio of leased to owned revenue equipment in compared to the decrease was offset by an increase in trailer depreciation  which can be attributed to an increase in the average number of owned trailers to  in compared to  in as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  deprecation and amortization was in compared to in  reflecting the increase in the ratio of leased to owned revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased to million in compared to million in primarily due to the increased use of expedited intermodal rail in the truckload segment for certain medium to long haul truckload freight 
the average number of owner operators remained relatively consistent in and at and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  purchased transportation increased to in compared to in due to the use of the expedited intermodal rail program 
insurance premiums and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability personal injury and property damage  physical damage and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher insurance premiums and a million increase in liability expense primarily due to growth in current year claims combined with adverse development related to claims from prior years 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  insurance and premiums and claims expense was in compared to in at december   the retention level for cargo loss was  and the retention level for liability was million per occurrence 
we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above amounts for which we are self insured for cargo and liability 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of pending claims  plus any incurred but not reported claims 
the accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and future development based on historical trends 
insurance premiums and claims expense will fluctuate based on claims experience  premium rates and self insurance retention levels 
operating taxes and licenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase is principally the result of an increase in vehicle registration and license expense 
vehicle registration and license expense fluctuates based on the trade activity of revenue equipment and the size of the owner operator and company tractor fleet 
the average number of tractors in our fleet including owner operators was  and  respectively  in and as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  operating taxes and licenses remained relatively consistent at in compared to in general and other operating expenses decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is due to the settlement of a litigation matter for million in the fourth quarter of combined with a lower percentage growth in general and administrative expenses as compared to the percentage increase in revenues 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  general and other operating expenses decreased to in compared to in see footnote  commitments and contingencies  of our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the settlement of the litigation matter 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in average borrowings  combined with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to in compared to in see footnote  long term debt  of our consolidated financial statements for further details

liquidity and capital resources our business requires significant capital investments 
we historically have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under a revolving credit facility  cash flows from operations  and long term equipment debt and operating leases 
our primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  borrowing under our revolving credit facility  proceeds of our accounts receivable securitization facility  and long term equipment debt and operating leases of revenue equipment 
each of our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility has maximum available borrowings of million 
we believe that funds provided by operations  borrowings under our line of credit and securitization facility  equipment installment loans and long term equipment debt and operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund our cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through our business will continue to require significant capital investments  particularly for revenue equipment and facilities  over the long term  which may require us to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions and the market price of our class a common stock  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
based on recent operating results  anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing expected to be available  we do not expect any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   cash generated from operations decreased million during as compared to the change was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable resulting from an increase in operating revenue of combined with an increase in day sales outstanding 
these increases were offset by increases in accounts payable  higher earnings and deferred income taxes attributable to improved profitability  and an increase in deprecation resulting from a higher percentage of equipment being owned instead of held under operating leases 
cash generated from operations increased million during as compared to the increase was primarily driven by an increase in earnings of million  combined with improvements in collection of accounts receivables in the truckload segment 
cash used in investing activities increased million during as compared to we invested million  net of sales proceeds  in capital expenditures during compared to million during the increase is due to the financing of tractors through long term debt versus operating leases  combined with the purchase of new trailers to support the expansion of our expedited intermodal rail program 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in compared to we invested million  net of sales proceeds  in capital expenditures during compared to million in the decrease was due to selling significantly more revenue equipment generating cash proceeds  while a greater portion of the replacement of revenue equipment was funded through the use of operating leases 
we expect cash capital expenditures  primarily for the replacement of revenue equipment net of sales proceeds and trade ins  to be approximately to million in cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the increase is due primarily to our stock offering completed in december of  shares of class a common stock which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
cash used in financing activities increased million during compared to the increase is due primarily to an increase in net repayments of long term debt of million in compared to million in the repayments of long term debt during were funded from cash flows from operations 
debt on october   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks  which replaced the existing million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in march the new facility is secured by revenue equipment and certain other assets and bears interest at the base rate  as defined  plus an applicable margin of to or libor plus an applicable margin of to based on our lease adjusted leverage ratio 
at december   the applicable margin was for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the credit facility also prescribes additional fees for letter of credit transactions and a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment and  respectively  at december  
the facility matures in october the credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth  fixed charge  and asset coverage ratios and a leverage ratio 
it also restricts our ability to engage in certain sale leaseback transactions  transactions with affiliates  investment transactions  acquisitions of our own capital stock  the payment of dividends  future asset dispositions except in the ordinary course of business or other business combination transactions and to incur liens and future indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants 
effective october   we also entered into an accounts receivable securitization 
under the securitization  we sell accounts receivable as part of a two step process that provides funding similar to a revolving credit facility 
to facilitate this transaction  xpress receivables  llc xpress receivables was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
xpress receivables is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity  which will purchase accounts receivable from us xpress  inc and xpress global systems  inc xpress receivables will fund these purchases with money borrowed under a new credit facility with three pillars funding  llc 
the borrowings are secured by the accounts receivable and paid down through collections on the accounts receivable 
we can borrow up to million under the securitization facility  subject to eligible receivables  and pay interest on borrowings based on commercial paper interest rates  plus an applicable margin  and a commitment fee on the daily  unused portion of the facility 
the securitization facility is reflected as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
the securitization facility requires that certain performance ratios be maintained with respect to accounts receivable and that xpress receivables preserve its bankruptcy remote nature 
at december   we had million of borrowings  of which million was long term  million was current maturities  and million was the securitization facility 
we also had approximately million in undrawn letters of credit 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of available borrowing remaining under our revolving credit facility and securitization 
current maturities include in balloon payments related to maturing revenue equipment installment notes 
the balloon payments are generally expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of the related revenue equipment  which is generally covered by repurchase and or trade agreements in principle between us and the equipment manufacturer 
equity at december   we had stockholders equity of million and long term debt  net of current maturities  of million  resulting in a debt to long term capitalization ratio of compared to at december  in december  we completed an offering of  shares our class a common stock at per share 
of these shares  we sold  shares  patrick e 
quinn  our co chairman  president and treasurer and max l 
fuller  our co chairman and chief executive officer  sold  and  shares  respectively  and related family partnerships sold  shares 
the offering generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our securitization facility and to retire debt on certain mortgage notes and revenue equipment installment notes 
in may  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock 
the repurchased shares will held as treasury stock and may be used for issuances under our employee stock option plan or for general corporate purposes  as the board of directors may determine 
in june  we repurchased  shares of class a common stock for equity investment in december  we acquired a interest in arnold transportation services  inc arnold and its affiliated companies for million in cash 
arnold is a truckload carrier that provides primarily short haul regional and dedicated dry van service in the southwest  southeast and northeast 
arnold s current management team controls the remaining interest and a majority of the board of directors 
we have not guaranteed any of arnold s debt and have no obligation to provide funding  services or assets 
under the agreement with arnold s management  we have a three year option to acquire of arnold by purchasing management s interest at a specified price plus an agreed upon annual return 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease certain revenue and service equipment and office and terminal facilities under long term non cancelable operating leases 
in making the decision to finance revenue equipment or facilities through long term debt or by entering into non cancelable lease agreements  we consider interest rates  capital requirements and the tax advantages of leasing versus owning the equipment or facilities 
at december   we leased approximately  tractors   trailers and office and terminal facilities under non cancelable operating leases with termination dates ranging from january to january lease payments on revenue equipment and office and terminal facilities are included in vehicle rents and general and other operating expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statement of operations 
rental expense related to revenue equipment and facilities was million in compared to million in the remaining obligation as of december   was million  with million due in the next twelve months 
certain equipment leases provide for us to guarantee a portion of the residual amount under certain circumstances at the end of the lease term 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted under these guarantees is approximately million at december  the residual value of a substantial portion of the leased revenue equipment is covered by repurchase or trade agreements in principle between us and the equipment manufacturer 
cash requirements the following table represents our outstanding contractual obligations at december   excluding letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit are maintained primarily to support our insurance program and are renewed on an annual basis

critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
recognition of revenue we generally recognize revenue and direct costs when shipments are completed 
certain revenue of xpress global systems  representing approximately of consolidated revenues at december   is recognized upon manifest  that is  the time when the trailer of the independent carrier is loaded  sealed and ready to leave the dock 
estimated expenses are recorded simultaneous with the recognition of revenue 
had revenue been recognized using another method  such as completed shipment  the impact would have been insignificant to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in years in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as state tax credit carry forwards or state net operating loss carry forwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined to be not realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations on both a consolidated and separate legal entity basis 
however  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets  we would use our judgment to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required at that time for that period 
the determination of the combined tax rate used to calculate our provision for income taxes for both current and deferred income taxes also requires significant judgment by management 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that the net deferred tax asset or liability be valued using enacted tax rates that we believe will be in effect when these temporary differences reverse 
we use the combined tax rates in effect at the time the financial statements are prepared since no better information is available 
if changes in the federal statutory rate or significant changes in the statutory state and local tax rates occur prior to or during the reversal of these items or if our filing obligations were to change materially  this could change the combined rate and  by extension  our provision for income taxes 
depreciation property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets net of estimated salvage value or trade in value 
we generally use estimated useful lives of years and years for tractors and trailers  respectively  with estimated salvage values ranging from of the capitalized cost 
the depreciable lives of our revenue equipment represent the estimated usage period of the equipment  which is generally substantially less than the economic lives 
the residual value of a substantial portion our equipment is covered by re purchase or trade agreements between us and the equipment manufacturer 
periodically  we evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  but not limited to  its experience with similar assets including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets  conditions in the used equipment market and prevailing industry practices 
changes in useful lives or salvage value estimates  or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material impact on financial results 
further  if our equipment manufacturer does not perform under the terms of the agreements for guaranteed trade in values  such non performance could have a materially negative impact on financial results 
goodwill the excess of the consideration paid us over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  which we adopted effective january  as required by the provisions of sfas  we tested goodwill for impairment using a two step process  based on the reporting unit fair value 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures impairment  if any 
we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and noted no impairment of goodwill in  and goodwill impairment tests are highly subjective 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by sfas no 
 we compared the estimated fair value of the reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill 
we define a reporting unit as an operating segment 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit could be bought or sold 
our methods for estimating reporting unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings  or other financial measures 
each of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples 
claims reserves and estimates claims reserves consist of estimates of cargo loss  physical damage  liability personal injury and property damage  employee medical expenses and workers compensation claims within our established retention levels 
claims in excess of retention levels are generally covered by insurance in amounts we consider adequate 
claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims including estimates of adverse development of known claims  plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims 
accruals for cargo loss  physical damage  liability and workers compensation claims are estimated based on our evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and historical information  primarily our own claims experience  along with assumptions about future events combined with the assistance of independent actuaries in the case of workers compensation and liability 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near future 
workers compensation and liability claims are particularly subject to a significant degree of uncertainty due to the potential for growth and development of the claims over time 
claims and insurance reserves related to workers compensation and liability are estimated by an independent third party actuary and we refer to these estimates in establishing the reserve 
liability reserves are estimated based on historical experience and trends  the type and severity of individual claims and assumptions about future costs 
further  in establishing the workers compensation and liability reserves  we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care and in general  interest rates  legal expenses and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
additionally  changes in assumptions made in actuarial studies could potentially have a material effect on the provision for workers compensation and liability claims 
we have experienced significant increases in insurance premiums and claims expense since september primarily related to workers compensation and liability insurance 
the increases have resulted from a significant increase in excess insurance premiums  adverse development in prior year losses  unfavorable accident experience and an increase in retention levels related to liability and workers compensation claims 
the retention level for liability insurance was  prior to september and has increased to ranges of  to million in subsequent periods 
prior to november  we had no retention for workers compensation insurance  which has increased to ranges of  to  in subsequent periods 
our insurance and claims expense varies based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense and the level of self insured retention 
the increase in self insurance retention levels since november and september has caused insurance and claims expense to be higher and more volatile than in historical periods 
factors that may affect future results our future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
the most significant of these factors are recessionary economic cycles  changes in customers inventory levels  excess tractor or trailer capacity  and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers  such as floorcovering and deferred airfreight from our airport to airport operations  and in regions of the country where we have a significant amount of business 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also are affected by increases in interest rates  fuel prices  taxes  tolls  license and registration fees  insurance costs  and the rising costs of healthcare for our employees 
we could be affected by strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer  port  border  or other shipping locations 
in addition  we cannot predict the effects on the economy or consumer confidence of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state  or heightened security requirements 
any of these could lead to border crossing delays or the temporary closing of the united states canada or united states mexico border 
enhanced security measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other results of competition 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability 
these factors include the following 
we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers  railroads  airfreight forwarders  and other transportation companies 
many of our competitors have more equipment  a wider range of services  greater capital resources  or other competitive advantages 
many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth in the economy 
this may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to continue to expand our business 
many of our customers also operate their own private trucking fleets  and they may decide to transport more of their own freight 
in recent years  many shippers have reduced the number of carriers they use by selecting core carriers as approved service providers 
as this trend continues  some of our customers may not select us as a core carrier 
many customers periodically solicit bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in a loss of business to competitors 
if we are unable to successfully execute our business strategy  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our strategy for increasing our revenue and profitability includes continuing to allocate more of our resources to our dedicated  regional  and expedited intermodal rail strategic business units  improving the profitability of all of our strategic business units through yield management and cost control efforts  and developing greater volume in xpress global systems airport to airport services 
we may experience difficulties and higher than expected expenses in reallocating our assets and developing new business 
for example  in  our subsidiary  xpress global systems introduced airport to airport transportation services for the airfreight and airfreight forwarding industries  which we intend to expand 
however  these airport to airport services have not been profitable since inception 
if we are unable to make our airport to airport business profitable  or continue to grow and improve the profitability of our other business units  our growth prospects  results of operations  and financial condition will be adversely affected 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expenses may exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
we self insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure from workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  and cargo and property damage  as well as employees health costs 
we also are responsible for our legal expenses within our self insured retentions for liability and workers compensation claims 
we currently reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and regularly evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect actual experience 
however  ultimate results may differ from our estimates  which could result in losses above reserved amounts 
our self insured retention limit for auto liability claims is million per occurrence   per occurrence for workers compensation claims  and  per occurrence for cargo claims 
because of our substantial self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
our operating results will be adversely affected if we experience an increase in the frequency and severity of claims for which we are self insured  accruals of significant amounts within a given period  or claims proving to be more severe than originally assessed 
we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with insurance carriers that we believe are financially sound 
although we believe our aggregate insurance limits are sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims  it is possible that one or more claims could exceed those limits 
insurance carriers recently have been raising premiums for many businesses  including trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expense could increase  or we could find it necessary to again raise our self insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced 
our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if these expenses increase  if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits  or if we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage 
our revenue growth may not continue at historical rates  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we have achieved significant revenue growth since becoming a public company in over the past several years  however  our revenue growth rate has slowed 
there is no assurance that our revenue growth rate will return to historical levels or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operating systems to respond to any future growth 
our operating margins could be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
slower or less profitable growth could adversely affect our stock price 
increases in driver compensation or difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
like nearly all trucking companies  we experience substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
in addition  due in part to current economic conditions  including the higher cost of fuel  insurance  and tractors  the available pool of independent contractor drivers has been declining 
because of the shortage of qualified drivers  the availability of alternative jobs due to the current economic expansion  and intense competition for drivers from other trucking companies  we expect to continue to face difficulty increasing the number of our drivers  including independent contractor drivers  who are one of our principal sources of planned growth 
in addition  our industry suffers from high turnover rates of drivers 
this turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing equipment 
if we are unable to continue to attract a sufficient number of drivers and independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our compensation packages  let trucks sit idle  or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands  all of which would adversely affect our growth and profitability 
in addition  the compensation we offer our drivers and independent contractors is subject to market forces  and we may find it necessary to continue to increase their compensation in future periods 
any increase in our operating costs or in the number of tractors without drivers would adversely affect our growth and profitability 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors  and diesel fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly  and prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to economic  political  and other market factors beyond our control 
substantially all of our customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate the effect of price increases over base amounts set in the contract 
however  these arrangements do not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in our not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
our fuel surcharges to customers do not fully recover all fuel increases because engine idle time  out of route miles  and non revenue miles  which are not generally billable to the customer 
we currently do not have any fuel hedging contracts in place 
if we are unable to retain our senior officers  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be harmed 
we are highly dependent upon the services of the following senior officers patrick e 
quinn  our co chairman of the board  president  and treasurer  max l 
fuller  our co chairman of the board  chief executive officer  and secretary  ray m 
harlin  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer  and jeffrey s 
wardeberg  executive vice president operations and chief operating officer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of these persons  except for salary continuation agreements with messrs 
quinn and fuller 
the loss of any of their services could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and future profitability 
we must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth  and we may be unable to do so 
increased prices  reduced productivity  and restricted availability of new revenue equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
we have experienced higher prices for new tractors over the past three years  partially as a result of government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines 
more restrictive environmental protection agency  or epa  emissions standards for will require vendors to introduce new engines  and some carriers may seek to purchase large numbers of tractors with pre engines  possibly leading to shortages 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors and trailers for these or other reasons 
as a result  we expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses and related financing costs for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the new engines are expected to reduce equipment productivity and lower fuel mileage and  therefore  increase our operating expenses 
we have agreements covering the terms of trade in and or repurchase commitments from our primary equipment vendors for disposal of a substantial portion of our revenue equipment 
the prices we expect to receive under these arrangements may be higher than the prices we would receive in the open market 
we may suffer a financial loss upon disposition of our equipment if these vendors refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements  if we fail to enter into definitive agreements that reflect the terms we expect  if we fail to enter into similar arrangements in the future  or if we do not purchase the required number of replacement units from the vendors 
because a substantial portion of our xpress global systems network costs are fixed  we will be adversely affected by any decrease in the volume or revenue per pound of freight shipped through our network 
moreover  if we are not able to increase the volume of freight shipped through our xpress global systems network  that segment may not reach profitability 
our xpress global systems operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
as a result  any decline in the volume or revenue per pound of freight we handle may have an adverse effect on our operating margin and our results of operations 
in addition  if we fail to increase the volume of freight shipped through our xpress global systems network  our airport to airport business may not achieve profitability 
typically  we do not have long term contracts with our airport to airport customers  and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels 
the actual shippers of the freight moved through our network include various manufacturers and distributors 
adverse business conditions affecting these shippers or adverse general economic conditions are likely to cause a decline in the volume of freight shipped through our network 
recently  xpress global systems has experienced lower than expected revenue and higher costs 
our inability to bring this segment to profitability would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our industry or business 
as a result of our level of debt  operating lease obligations  and encumbered assets our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions and competitive pressures is heightened  we will continue to be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to operating lease payments and repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  our profitability is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates because some of our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates  and future borrowings and lease financing arrangements will be affected by any such fluctuations  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or other purposes may be limited 
our operating leases and debt obligations could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
there is no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
service instability in the railroad industry could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer expedited intermodal rail services  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
we depend on the major us railroads for our expedited intermodal rail services 
in most markets  rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad 
any reduction in service by the railroads with whom we have relationships is likely to increase the cost of the rail based services we provide and reduce the reliability  timeliness  and overall attractiveness of our rail based services 
for example  current service disruptions in the railroad industry have impacted expedited rail service throughout the united states 
although the disruptions have been primarily with railroads other than our major providers  it is possible that future service disruptions that affect our operations may occur  which would decrease demand for  or the profitability of  our expedited intermodal rail business 
in addition  because most of the railroads workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements  our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes between the railroads and their union employees 
further  railroads are relatively free to adjust shipping rates up or down as market conditions permit 
price increases could result in higher costs to our customers and our ability to offer expedited intermodal rail services 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
our operations are regulated and licensed by various us  canadian  and mexican agencies 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the united states department of transportation  or dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to us and canadian regulations 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours of service  ergonomics  or other matters affecting safety or operating methods 
future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices  influence the demand for transportation services  or require us to incur significant additional costs 
higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices would adversely affect our results of operations 
beginning in  motor carriers were required to comply with several changes to dot hours of service requirements that may have a positive or negative effect on driver hours and miles and our operations 
a citizens advocacy group successfully petitioned the courts that the new rules were developed without driver health in mind 
pending further action by the courts or the effectiveness of new rules addressing these issues  congress has enacted a law that extends the effectiveness of the new rules until september  we cannot predict whether there will be changes to the hours of service rules  the extent of any changes  or whether there will be further court challenges 
given this uncertainty  we are unable to determine the future effect of driver hour regulations on our operations 
the dot is also considering implementing higher safety requirements on trucks 
these regulatory changes may have an adverse affect on our future profitability 
we may not make acquisitions in the future  or if we do  we may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses 
we have made eleven acquisitions since becoming a public company in accordingly  acquisitions have provided a substantial portion of our growth 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  negotiating  or consummating any future acquisitions 
if we fail to make any future acquisitions  our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected 
any acquisitions we undertake could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or incurring indebtedness 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees  and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make acquisitions in the future  there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate favorable terms or successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
if we fail to do so  or we experience other risks associated with acquisitions  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
seasonality in the trucking industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern as customers increase shipments prior to and reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
additionally  shipments can be adversely impacted by winter weather conditions 
our operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency  increased maintenance costs of revenue equipment in colder weather and increased insurance and claims costs due to adverse winter weather conditions 
revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  fasb  issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r  which supersedes interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  issued in january this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie when a company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both 
fin r also requires consolidation of existing  non controlled affiliates if the vie is unable to finance its operations without investor support  or where other investors do not have exposure to the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
for enterprises that are not small business issuers  fin r is to be applied to all variable interest entities by the end of the first reporting period ending after march  our adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we will adopt sfas r on july  as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk 
our market risk is affected by changes in interest rates 
historically  we have used a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed interest rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable interest rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
we are exposed to variable interest rate risk principally from our securitization facility and revolving credit facility 
at december   we had  in variable rate borrowings outstanding 
we are exposed to fixed interest rate risk principally from equipment notes and mortgages 
at december   we had borrowings totaling  comprised of  of variable rate borrowings and  of fixed rate borrowings 
holding other variables constant such as borrowing levels  the earnings and cash flow impact of a one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would have an unfavorable favorable impact of approximately commodity price risk 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political and market factors that are outside of our control 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through the collection of fuel surcharges 
however  fuel surcharges do not always fully offset increases in fuel prices 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in accordance with sfas  we adjust any derivative instruments to fair value through earnings on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had no derivate financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
