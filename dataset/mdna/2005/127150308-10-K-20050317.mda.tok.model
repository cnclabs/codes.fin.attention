restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
after reviewing this letter  cache s management began a review of its lease related accounting policies and determined that its then current method of accounting for leasehold improvements reimbursed by landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases landlord construction allowances was not in accordance with gaap 
the company had historically accounted for landlord construction allowance reimbursements as reductions to leasehold improvements on the consolidated balance sheets and capital expenditures in investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cache s management has determined that the appropriate interpretation of fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
as of january   the company reclassified landlord construction allowance reimbursements from net leasehold improvements to deferred rent to conform with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
there was no effect on the company s income statements 
leasehold improvements and total assets increased for each year presented as a result of the reclassification and was offset by an increase in deferred rent and total liabilities 
as a result of the above  the company has restated its consolidated balance sheet as of december  and its consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the week periods ended december  and december  see note to the consolidated financial statements of the report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for the week periods ended december  and december  the accompanying management s discussion and analysis describes these corrections 
accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventories 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market using the retail method of accounting 
we make assumptions to adjust the value of inventory based on historical experience and current information 
this procedure inherently reduces the carrying value of inventories as permanent markdowns are initiated 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter transaction or upon receipt by a customer 
sales of merchandise via our website are recognized at the time of shipment to the customer 
our customers have the right to return merchandise 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated returns 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns and record  as a reduction to sales  a provision for estimated product returns  which is determined based on historical experience 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores and office space under operating leases 
most leases contain construction allowance reimbursements by landlords  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term and records the difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent liability 
to account for construction allowance reimbursements from landlords and rent holidays  the company records a deferred rent liability included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the lease term  as a reduction to rent expense on the consolidated income statements 
for leases containing rent escalation clauses  the company records minimum rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term on the consolidated income statement 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
weeks ended weeks ended december  december  january  operating results net sales cost of sales gross profit store operating expenses general and administrative expenses operating income other income net income before income taxes income taxes net income weeks ended january  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
the results of the company for fiscal were favorably impacted by the extra reporting week 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year  for the week period ended january  as compared to the week period in fiscal the one week of additional sales in fiscal was approximately of the total sales increase 
the sales increase reflects million of additional net sales as a result of a increase in comparable store sales 
the remainder of the increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the combined result of higher net sales  partially due to the additional one week of sales in the fiscal period and increased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher initial margins resulting from sourcing improvements 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to the increase in stores opened over the past two years and an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of million 
store operating expenses in fiscal were also higher than fiscal  due to the additional one week period included in fiscal results 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of  or  above the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to from  primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in fiscal costs 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal were also slightly higher than fiscal  due the additional one week period included in fiscal results 
other income 
other income increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year  primarily attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates during fiscal  as compared to fiscal other income generally consists of interest income 
we expect interest income to grow in the future as cash flow from operations is greater than expenditures on new stores and remodeling 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million from million  an increase of  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to higher taxable income  and was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a reversal of state income tax over accrued in prior fiscal years 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased to million from million  an increase of million or  over the same period last year 
weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales as a result of a increase in comparable store sales 
the remainder of the increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores 
we believe our new store expansion and remodeling program will help to materially increase sales during the next few years 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase in gross profit was the combined result of higher net sales and an increase in gross profit margins  due to a more focused approach to inventory management 
we plan to increase inventory turns in future years  as we reduce dress inventory levels  turns of which are historically slower than sportswear inventory turns 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this was due primarily to an increase in the total number of new stores open 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to an increase in payroll expense of million and an increase in advertising expense of million 
we anticipate store operating expenses will run slightly higher than historical levels  as a percent of sales in the short term  as we increase our rate of store expansion 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to increase in corporate level payroll of million and professional fees of  we anticipate general and administrative expenses will return to lower historical levels in the next few years  as we have completed most of the headquarters staffing necessary to fuel the current store expansion 
other income 
other income increased to  from  primarily attributable to higher average cash balances during fiscal  partially offset by lower interest rates in fiscal we expect interest income to grow in the future due to stronger cash flows from operations and higher interest rates  as the us economy recovers 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million from million  an increase of million  over the same period last year 
this increase was attributable to higher taxable income  as well as an increase in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the overall effective income tax rate is attributable to increased levels of federal taxable income subject to tax in a higher tax bracket  as well as a change in the mix of income subject to tax in the various states in which we conduct business 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased to million from million  an increase of million  over the same period last year 
quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during our fourth fiscal quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during our third fiscal quarter july  august and september 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended january  we derived this data from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have prepared this information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that we have included all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 
the operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
cash flows have increased significantly in fiscal and  due to the dramatic increase in gross margin contribution 
we expect this trend to continue over the next several years 
as a result of the restatement of our financial statements to reflect the reclassification of landlord construction allowance reimbursements from net leasehold improvements to deferred rent  cash flow from operations increased in fiscal and from the amounts previously reported 
cash used in investing activities also increased in fiscal and reflecting the offsetting increase in leasehold improvements 
as of january   we had working capital of million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in deferred taxes of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million and a tax benefit of million from stock option exercises  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories of million primarily due to the net increase of stores  reversal of deferred rent of million  and an increase in receivables of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to the net increase of stores 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  a decrease in receivables of million  an increase in accounts payable of  and an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal these amounts were used for the purchase of marketable securities as well as the payment for equipment and leasehold improvements in new and remodeled stores 
our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately to million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  primarily due to stock option exercises and stock issuances 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from stock issuances and stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities was negligible in fiscal we have a line of credit with fleet bank  na  permitting us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
at january   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum annual rate equal to the bank s prime rate  currently 
the agreement relating to this facility contains selected financial and other covenants 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness or create or incur liens on our assets 
while this facility is unsecured  if a default occurs under the facility  we are required to grant the lender a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
we have at all times been in compliance with all loan covenants 
this facility currently expires in november we believe that cash flow from operations  our current available cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  payments due in period within after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations employment contracts  purchase obligations   operating leases      total      payments due in period within after total year years years years in thousands commercial commitments credit facility standby letters of credit   total   we issue standby letters of credit primarily for the importation of merchandise inventories 
the company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear the risk in two specific ways 
first  the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  the statement of income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of january   we had no borrowing under our credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet  if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement requires an entity to recognize the cost of employee services received in share based payment transactions and measure the cost on a grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective for the company s financial statements issued for periods beginning after june  in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the adoption of finr did not have any impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides a three step impairment model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires the company to recognize such impairments as an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and fair value at the reporting date 
the guidance is effective for the company during the first quarter of fiscal the company does not believe that the adoption of eitf will have a significant effect on its financial statements
