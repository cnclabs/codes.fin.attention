when used in this annual report on form k  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to abgenix are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and under risk factors that might affect future results set forth in item of part i of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand our company 
our business we are a biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the discovery  development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
we intend to use our proprietary technologies to build a diversified product portfolio that we expect to develop and commercialize internally or through joint development and commercialization arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnologies companies 
we are co developing our most advanced proprietary product candidate  panitumumab  with amgen 
panitumumab is in pivotal trials  and we have one other product candidate  abx pth  in early stage clinical trials 
in addition  we have entered into a variety of contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and genomics companies involving our technologies 
we use our closely integrated process sciences and manufacturing capabilities for the manufacture of our own proprietary product candidates and also offer these services to our collaborators and others 
we have entered into joint development arrangements with companies such as chugai  u pharma and dendreon  and intend to enter into additional joint development agreements 
we generally expect to self fund preclinical and clinical activities to determine preliminary safety and efficacy before deciding whether to conduct further product development internally or enter into joint development and commercialization agreements 
our strategy is designed to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending and to continue to focus our activities on product development and commercialization 
we also have a broad collaboration in oncology with astrazeneca uk limited 
pursuant to this collaboration we are providing preclinical and clinical research support and process development for up to product candidates to be developed by astrazeneca  and have the opportunity to co develop up to additional products with astrazeneca 
our financial position and liquidity we derive our revenues from our technology out licensing contracts  our proprietary product development agreements  our target sourcing contracts and our production services contracts 
prior to the potential marketing approval of panitumumab  we expect that substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future will result from payments under these and similar arrangements and that payments we receive under these arrangements will continue to be subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our product development activities  both under contractual arrangements with third parties and related to our independent research and development efforts 
regulatory and business factors will require us to expend substantial funds in the course of completing required additional development  preclinical testing and clinical trials of  and attaining regulatory approvals for  product candidates 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we have incurred net losses since we were organized as an independent company  including a net loss of million in we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as a result of our research and development costs and manufacturing start up costs  including costs associated with conducting preclinical development and clinical trials  and charges related to purchases of technology or other assets 
we expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  which included proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes due  net of initial purchasers discount and commission  in december the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
we plan to continue to make significant expenditures to staff and operate our own manufacturing facility and support our research and development activities  including preclinical product development and clinical trials 
we expect that these activities may increase our operating expenses over the next few years in comparison to prior periods 
we may also repurchase a portion of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due results of operations years ended december   and contract revenues contract revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because contract revenues depend to a large extent on the success or failure of research and development efforts undertaken by our collaborators and licensees  our year to year contract revenues can fluctuate significantly and are inherently difficult to predict 
the primary components of contract revenues for all periods were as follows technology licensing we recognized a total of million  million and million in  and  respectively  from licensing our proprietary technologies 
revenues consisted primarily of the following chugai in  we recognized million under an agreement with chugai in which we exclusively licensed to chugai rights under patent applications and patents held by us related to methods of treatment of certain diseases with an antibody 
celltech r d ltd 
in  we recognized million under an agreement with celltech in which we granted a license of our slam technology 
the payments we received represented a research license fee and service fees for the transfer of technology  net of shared closing costs 
we recognized these fees in the first quarter of  during which we fulfilled our obligations to provide celltech with the applicable protocols  technical information  and training to enable celltech to effectively utilize the slam technology 
additionally  in  and we recognized various fees  such as research license and service fees  research milestone payments  product license fees  product development and option fees  under agreements related to the licensing of our xenomouse technology 
these revenues were generated from several collaborators  but were primarily from pfizer  amgen  chiron and curagen 
proprietary product development we recognized a total of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in each of these periods  we recognized revenue for development reimbursement pursuant to our joint development and commercialization agreements for the development of the panitumumab program 
in addition to the panitumumab program  and also included the development of abx cbl 
in  and  these revenues consisted of reimbursement of development costs 
the revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in reimbursement of development costs as our collaborator s cost exceeded our cost for the development of the panitumumab program 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the discontinuation of the development of the abx cbl program in  which resulted in the reduction of development costs related to reimbursements 
non manufacturing production services we recognized a total of million and million in and  respectively  for production services 
in both and  these revenues consisted primarily of process sciences services and were generated from one of our product services agreements 
in we did not recognize any revenues from our production services 
contract manufacturing revenues contract manufacturing revenues totaled million in these revenues consisted primarily of manufacturing services for the manufacture of an antibody product for a customer under a production services agreement 
in and  we did not recognize any revenues from manufacturing services 
cost of goods manufactured cost of goods manufactured was million in cost of goods manufactured included material  direct labor  outside testing and overhead costs associated with manufacturing an antibody product for a customer under a production services agreement 
in and  we did not have any cost of goods manufactured 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in the major components of research and development expenses for  and were as follows december  in thousands product development    research    in licensing    total research and development costs    product development costs include costs of preclinical development  cell line development and conducting clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates 
additionally  starting in  product development includes costs related to cell line development activities we perform under our production services contracts 
the primary components of product development include the costs of abgenix personnel  drug supply costs  research fees charged by outside contractors  co development costs  and facility expenses including depreciation 
our product development costs increased in as compared to  primarily due to a significant increase in the development costs for the panitumumab program 
to a lesser extent  the increase was due to costs related to new preclinical and clinical product candidates including abx pth 
in  our product development costs decreased in comparison to development costs for the panitumumab program increased significantly in  however  offsetting this increase were decreases that were primarily related to discontinuing the development of abx il and abx cbl  as well as decreases in costs for abx pth  abx ma and other pipeline product candidates 
product development costs can vary significantly from period to period depending on the progress of the development activities in the period 
overall  we expect costs associated with product development to increase in as we and our co development partner amgen continue to focus our development efforts on the panitumumab program 
in addition  we expect product development costs related to abx pth to increase in research costs include costs associated with research  and testing of antibodies we generate  whether for ourselves or for our customers  prior to the development stage which begins with the commencement of preclinical activities 
research costs also include the costs of research relating to proprietary technologies  including enhancements to those technologies 
the primary components of research costs include the costs of abgenix personnel  facilities  including depreciation  and lab supplies 
our research costs generally remained at the same level in as compared to beginning in october of  we implemented a restructuring of our operations and reduced many of our research and testing activities including those related to new target validation 
as a result  our research costs decreased in as compared to we expect research costs to increase in due to increased research activities related to our proprietary and partner pipelines 
in licensing costs include costs to acquire licenses to develop and commercialize various technologies and product candidates 
in licensing costs decreased in and primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with licensing charges from arrangements with research institutions and others 
we expect in licensing costs to decrease in major components of research and development costs for and were as follows costs of abgenix personnel personnel costs primarily include salary  benefits  recruiting and relocation costs 
costs of abgenix personnel to support research and development activities increased in from and decreased in from the increase in was primarily due to increased personnel costs for process sciences and preclinical research and increased use of our manufacturing facility for development activities  including process validation for the manufacture of our conformance lots 
the decrease in was attributed to our restructuring plan implemented in october  which resulted in an approximately reduction in total employees overall 
we were able to support a reduced workforce in due to discontinuing the development of abx il and abx cbl and because our co development partner has taken over responsibility for many new development activities for the development of panitumumab 
consulting and outside contractors costs of consulting and outside contractors to support research and development activities decreased in from and decreased in from the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction of activities performed by outside contractors related to toxicology studies  and the decrease was offset in part by an increase in clinical trial activities for panitumumab 
the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction of activities performed by outside contractors related to the development of cell lines for our product candidates 
clinical research fees clinical research fees including clinical investigator site fees  monitoring costs  and data management costs  increased in from and decreased in from the increase in was primarily due to increased clinical trial activities for panitumumab and abx pth 
the decrease in was primarily due to the decrease in clinical trials being conducted for abx il and abx cbl  partially offset by increased clinical trial activities for panitumumab 
drug supply costs drug supply costs decreased in from and decreased in from the decrease in was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing the conformance lots 
the decrease in was primarily due to discontinuing the clinical trials related to abx il and abx cbl 
co development costs co development costs  which primarily consist of reimbursement to amgen for our share of panitumumab development costs  increased in from and increased in from the increases in both years were primarily related to cost sharing for activities performed by amgen associated with the co development of panitumumab 
facility and other overhead related costs these costs  which primarily consist of depreciation  rent and other facility related costs  increased in from and decreased in from the increase in was primarily related to increased use of our manufacturing facility for development activities  including process validation activities to the manufacture of panitumumab conformance lots 
the decrease in was primarily related to facility expenses charged to manufacturing start up costs in as we began manufacturing antibody therapeutic candidates in portions of our manufacturing facility in the second quarter of manufacturing start up costs manufacturing start costs were million and million in and  respectively 
we began manufacturing antibody therapeutic candidates in portions of our manufacturing facility in the second quarter of  at which time we began to depreciate the portions of the facility that were placed into service 
manufacturing start up costs include certain costs associated with our new manufacturing facility  including depreciation  outside contractor costs and personnel costs for activities such as quality assurance and quality control 
the primary component of this cost in was a fee of approximately million for the negotiated cancellation of a manufacturing supply agreement with an outside contractor  lonza biologics plc 
the manufacturing agreement was for a production suite held exclusively for us  which we were not using 
in addition to the absence of the cancellation fee in  the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the increased use of our manufacturing facility for the manufacture of panitumumab and other development activities  including process validation for the manufacture of panitumumab conformance lots 
amortization of identified intangible assets our identified intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology including patents and certain royalty rights we acquired through the acquisitions of hesed biomed in  abgenix biopharma and intraimmune in  and jt america s interest in xenotech in amortization of intangible assets totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
beginning january   upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we will perform impairment tests annually  or earlier if indications of impairment exist 
we conducted an initial test for impairment of our goodwill in and an annual impairment test in  and  and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the decrease in amortization in from was due to a reduction in intangible assets due to the write off in the second quarter of of the remaining value of the catalytic antibody technology that we acquired through the acquisition of hesed biomed inc general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include compensation  professional services  consulting and other expenses related to information systems  legal  finance  and an allocation of facility costs 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a charge of million in related to the sublease of one of our facilities 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in consulting services related to the implementation of our new information systems in and in legal costs  partially offset by a charge of million in due to the sublease of one of our facilities for less than our obligation under the lease 
impairment of intangible assets in june  we determined that an impairment of the company s acquired technology in the field of catalytic antibodies had occurred and that the estimated value had declined to zero 
this technology  which includes intellectual property  was acquired in through the acquisition of hesed biomed  inc we decided to focus our resources on other research and development projects and to wind down our catalytic antibody program 
additionally  after assessing the associated patent position and the likelihood of sale or license of the technology to a third party  we further determined in that the possibility of generating positive future cash flows from the technology was remote 
as a result of this determination  we recorded an impairment charge of million in in  we decided to discontinue the development of anti properdin antibodies 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million for previously capitalized costs related to licenses and research funding for the development of therapeutic antibodies to the complement protein properdin  which we licensed from gliatech  inc restructuring charge in october  we announced a restructuring plan  which consisted primarily of a reduction in employees 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in to account for severance  medical and other benefits associated with this restructuring 
of the million  million was paid in and the remainder in interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and loss from early extinguishment of debt 
interest and other income expense  net  totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in as compared to was due to the million of loss from early extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of million of our convertible subordinated notes due and the result of lower average cash  marketable securities and cash equivalent balances 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average investment balances 
interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our convertible subordinated notes due interest expense totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the interest related to the credit facility with amgen and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest 
the interest expense increase in as compared to was primarily due to the million of convertible notes due we issued in march  which accrue interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
interest expense in the amount of million  million and million related to the convertible notes was capitalized in  and  respectively 
capitalized interest decreased in and the third and fourth quarters of because we placed into service a portion of our manufacturing facility in when we began manufacturing antibody therapeutic candidates in that portion of the facility 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which accrue interest at an annual rate of payable semi annually  and used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase million of the outstanding notes due in  we expect to pay and record expense of approximately million in interest related to our convertible notes assuming we do not repurchase or otherwise retire any additional notes due additionally  we will record interest at on the amounts we draw on our credit facility with amgen until we repay the balance in full 
for the year ended december   the amount of interest expense recorded under the amgen arrangement was  the amount of any such advances  plus interest  may be repaid out of profits resulting from future product sales  however  we are generally not obligated to repay any portion of the outstanding balance if panitumumab does not reach commercialization 
impairment of investments in  we invested million in equity securities of mds proteomics  a privately held company  in connection with our collaboration with that company 
as of december  and june   we determined that an impairment of our investment had occurred and estimated that the value of our investment had declined to zero and million  respectively 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of and second quarter of the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated value as determined by our management and our revised or original cost basis 
we purchased an aggregate amount of million of common stock of curagen and immunogen as strategic investments at various times in and in  declines in the fair value of the curagen and immunogen common stock were deemed to be other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded a total impairment charge of million for the year ended december  as of december   these investments were recorded at fair value in long term investments on the balance sheet  and the net unrealized holding gain of million is included as a component of stockholders equity 
if we deem these investments further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on these investments 
foreign income tax expense foreign income tax expense was recorded reflecting an income tax provision on foreign contract research projects of approximately  in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
we have also invested in certain marketable equity securities of immunogen and curagen for strategic reasons 
these securities had a fair value of million at december  cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this reflects an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the major components of the changes in cash used in operating activities were primarily the following an increase of million in in our liability to amgen under the joint development agreement 
there was no such liability outstanding in and an increase of million and million in and  respectively  in payments pursuant to the lonza contract cancellation obligation 
as of december   we had no remaining obligations to lonza 
an increase of million and a decrease of million in and  respectively  in research and development and manufacturing start up costs  not including the lonza contract cancellation charge in  amortization of identified intangible assets and depreciation related to the development of new products 
an increase of million in costs of goods manufactured in there was no cost of goods manufactured in and a decrease of million and an increase of million in and  respectively  in customer payments 
both the decrease in and the increase in were affected by the timing of payments received under our contracts 
a decrease of million and million in and  respectively  in cash from interest income 
the decrease in was due to lower average balances of cash equivalents and marketable securities  partially offset by a gradual increase in interest rates throughout the decrease in was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average balance of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by and used in investing activities primarily consisted of the following capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the investments in  and reflected primarily investment in construction in progress and equipment for our new manufacturing facility as well as investment in lab equipment 
the investments in also included investment in leasehold improvements in our new office facility and process science laboratory and investments in computer hardware and software  including the acquisition of a new enterprise resource planning system 
sales and maturities  net of purchases  of marketable securities of million and million in and  respectively  and purchases  net of sales and maturities  of marketable securities of million in cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by financing activities included million of net proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes due  as described below 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to repurchase million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due  which we issued in march in  cash provided by financing activities included million of net proceeds from our issuance of series a and a redeemable convertible preferred stock  as described below 
in  cash provided by financing activities included million of net proceeds from our issuance of convertible subordinated notes due  as described below 
in  and we received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively from the issuance of our common stock upon exercise of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in december  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in a private placement 
the notes are senior in right to any existing indebtedness which is subordinated by its terms  including our convertible subordinated notes due and convertible subordinated note due the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per each  principal amount of notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of payable on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on december  and are redeemable at our option on or after december  at the specified redemption prices 
in addition  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  subject to certain conditions  if we undergo certain changes in control 
in addition  upon certain changes in control and subject to certain conditions  additional shares of common stock may become issuable to holders upon conversion of the notes 
holders of the notes also may require us to repurchase their notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of an event of default 
proceeds from issuance of the notes  net of commissions payable to the initial purchasers  were million 
in october  in connection with a collaboration agreement  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with astrazeneca 
pursuant to the agreement  we issued to astrazeneca million of series a and million of series a convertible preferred stock which mature and years  respectively  from the date of issuance 
the net proceeds from the securities were million 
due to the redemption feature  we do not record the redeemable convertible preferred stock in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to its terms  the series a preferred stock was redeemed at the option of astrazeneca in february and we issued astrazeneca a convertible subordinated note with a principal amount of million  which matures on october  no interest is payable on the note except in the event of a payment default by us 
subject to various terms and conditions  if a certain milestone event is reached  we will have the option to issue to astrazeneca up to million of series a preferred stock and if a further milestone event is reached  we will have the option to issue to astrazeneca up to million of series a preferred stock 
each of the series a preferred stock and the series a preferred stock will have a maturity date that is five years from issuance 
subject to certain conditions  we can convert each series of preferred stock and can convert the convertible subordinated note issued to astrazeneca into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of a the average market price for the days prior to the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date provided that the average market price shall in no event be higher than of the market price on the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date or b per share 
astrazeneca may convert each series of preferred stock and the convertible subordinated note into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  at any time prior to the earlier of a the redemption date or b the maturity date  as applicable 
we must redeem all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock  if any  at a cash redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference by october   the mandatory redemption date 
the note matures on october   if still outstanding 
in addition  we can  upon at least days notice to the holder  redeem the shares of series a preferred stock and the convertible subordinated note for cash in an amount equal to its liquidation preference or face amount  as the case may be  at any time prior to maturity of the instrument 
in addition to the mandatory redemption and maturity dates of these securities  certain events can give rise to an earlier redemption 
in certain circumstances  we have certain rights to convert the securities into common stock instead of redeeming the securities for cash 
see note to the financial statements for a full description of the conversion  redemption  and liquidation rights 
in march  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share subject to certain adjustments 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of and we are obligated to pay interest on march and september of each year 
the notes will mature on march  and are redeemable at our option on or after march   or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control 
in addition  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon occurrence of an event of default 
proceeds from the sale of the notes  net of commissions payable to the initial purchasers of the notes but before subtracting other offering expenses payable by us  were million 
in march and february  we obtained stand by letters of credit for million and million  respectively  from a commercial bank as security for our obligations under two facility leases 
these were increased in january to and million  respectively  in connection with amendments to our facility leases 
in december  the million stand by letter of credit increased to million 
the outstanding stand by letters of credit are secured by an investment account  in which we must maintain a balance of approximately million 
financing uncertainties related to our business plan 
we plan to continue to make significant expenditures to staff and operate our own manufacturing facility and support our research and development activities  including preclinical product development and clinical trials 
we also intend to look for opportunities to acquire new technology through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions 
we may spend additional amounts to support new production services contracts 
we currently intend to use our available cash on hand to finance these projects and business developments  but we might also pursue other financing alternatives  such as equity  equity linked debt or debt financing  a bank line of credit  sale lease back financing  asset sales  funding by one or more collaborators or a mortgage financing  that may become available to us 
we have a currently effective shelf registration that allows us to issue from time to time up to million in equity or debt securities 
whether we use cash on hand or choose to obtain financing will depend on  among other things  the future success of our business  the prevailing interest rate environment and the condition of financial markets generally 
in october  we entered into an amendment of our joint development and commercialization agreement with amgen for the co development of panitumumab 
under the agreement  amgen is obligated to make available in and up to million in advances that we may use to fund a portion of our share of development and commercialization costs after we have contributed million toward development costs in as of december  we had a carrying balance of million and had drawn an additional million under this facility in february we expect to continue to make use of this credit facility in up to the million limit 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
two of our proprietary product candidates  panitumumab and abx pth  are in various stages of clinical trials which may require significant expenditures in the foreseeable future 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
we test our potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies to identify disease indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials on our own or with our collaborators to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for one or more indications for a given product candidate in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
for example  in january and may  we announced that clinical trials of our proprietary product candidate abx il as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis  respectively  did not support further clinical studies of that product candidate 
additionally in february  we announced that the clinical trial of our proprietary product candidate abx cbl as a treatment for graft versus host disease  did not support further clinical studies of that product candidate 
an important element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a diverse range of product candidates for selected disease indications in our areas of focus 
we may enter co development agreements  similar to our agreement with amgen for panitumumab  and may enter into additional joint development agreements earlier in the development life cycle of product candidates than we did in our existing co development agreements 
we have begun to implement our collaboration strategy through co development arrangements with companies such as chugai  u and dendreon 
our strategy is designed to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
the decisions to terminate or wind down our clinical programs for developing abx il  abx cbl and abx ma have reduced the diversity of our product portfolio 
we believe that this effect is temporary in view of the number and diversity of potential product candidates we have in preclinical development 
for example  we recently advanced abx pth from the preclinical stage into a clinical study in patients with secondary hyperparathyrodism 
to the extent  however  that we are unable to maintain a diverse and broad range of product candidates  our success would depend to a greater extent on the success of one or a few product candidates 
our proprietary product candidates also have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
the number  size and type of clinical trials we conduct for a particular product candidate are also affected by the policies of the fda and european regulatory agencies regarding the availability of possible expedited approval procedures  which we may seek to utilize 
these policies may change from time to time 
as we conduct clinical trials for a given product candidate  we may decide or the fda may require us to make changes in our plans and protocols 
such changes may relate to  for example  changes in the standard of care for a particular disease indication  comparability of efficacy and toxicity of materials where a change in materials is proposed  or competitive developments foreclosing the availability of expedited approval procedures 
we may be required to support proposed changes with additional preclinical or clinical testing  which could delay the expected time line for concluding clinical trials 
in addition  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we also may be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other parts of our business 
in particular  our future liquidity and capital requirements also will depend on many factors other than our research and development activities  including the scope and results of preclinical development and clinical trials  the retention of existing and establishment of further co development  licensing  manufacturing and other agreements  if any  continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the cost of establishing our manufacturing capabilities and complying with good manufacturing practice regulations  the cost of conducting commercialization activities and arrangements  the time and expense involved in seeking regulatory approvals  competing technological and market developments  the time and expense of filing and prosecuting patent applications  and enforcing and defending against patent claims  our investment in  or acquisition of  other companies  the amount of product or technology in licensing in which we engage  and other factors not within our control 
we believe that our current cash balances  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and the cash generated from our licensing and other agreements will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least one year 
however  because of the uncertainties in our business discussed above  among others  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
in addition  we may choose to  or prevailing business conditions may require us to  obtain additional financing from time to time 
we may choose to raise additional funds through public or private financing  licensing and other agreements or other arrangements 
we cannot be sure that any additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity or equity related financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants 
we may also choose to obtain funding through collaborations  licensing and other contractual arrangements 
such agreements may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
history of net losses 
we have incurred net losses since our organization as an independent company  including in the last five years net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs relating to the development of our xenomouse and xenomax technologies and antibody therapeutic product candidates  general and administrative costs relating to our operations  manufacturing start up costs relating to our new manufacturing facility including depreciation  outside contractor costs and personnel costs for activities such as quality assurance and quality control  impairment charges relating to our strategic investments in curagen  immunogen and mds proteomics  impairment charges relating to technology in the field of catalytic antibodies  which includes intellectual property that was acquired through the acquisition of hesed biomed 
we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as a result of our research and development costs  including costs associated with conducting preclinical development and clinical trials  which will continue to be substantial  charges related to purchases of technology or other assets  and costs associated with establishing and operating our manufacturing facilities 
we intend to invest significantly in our products prior to entering into licensing agreements 
this will increase our need for capital and will result in losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that the amount of operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases or decreases in our research and development efforts  the execution or termination of licensing and other agreements  and the initiation  and success or failure  of clinical trials 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards exclude losses incurred prior to our formation in july further  we have capitalized the amounts associated with the patent cross license and settlement agreement with genpharm  which we have expensed for financial statement accounting purposes and we are amortizing those amounts over a period of approximately years for tax purposes 
the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
critical accounting estimates several estimates and judgments involved in the application of accounting principles impact the financial results that we report 
we are required to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in our estimates or judgments could materially impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  and accounting for goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes and stock option valuation 
revenue recognition we derive our contract revenue from license  option  service and milestone fees received from customers 
services include those performed under our technology out licensing  co development and production services agreements 
as described below  within the framework of generally accepted accounting principles  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and applied in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue in any period 
abgenix enters into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in order to meet its customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of up front fees  license payments  research and development services  milestone payments  future royalties  and manufacturing arrangements 
multiple element revenue agreements entered into on or after july  are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in eitf must be treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or sooner if indications of impairment exist 
under our accounting policy  we have adopted the beginning of the fourth quarter as an annual goodwill impairment test date 
following this approach  we compare the carrying values available as of september with the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to assess if there has been a potential impairment  and  if impairment is indicated  complete the measurement of impairment under the procedures established by sfas because we have determined that we have one reporting unit under sfas no 
 our market capitalization is considered to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the reporting unit 
we also consider whether current business and general market conditions suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit has likely declined below its carrying value 
for a brief period during the first quarter of  our common stock had traded at a price that represented a market capitalization less than our book value 
however this condition did not persist for long and since march   our common stock has traded at a price that represents a market capitalization higher than our book value 
our market capitalization at december  was million based on the december  stock price of per share 
accordingly  no impairment has occurred 
if we were to determine in a future period that an impairment of goodwill existed  the impairment measurement procedures could result in a charge for the impairment of goodwill 
furthermore  a change in our determination of reporting units could result in a charge for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
a change in the determination of reporting units could occur should we reorganize into reporting units such that each unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management to evaluate the performance of that unit 
as of december   the carrying value of our goodwill was million 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets held and used must be tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is being used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current expectation that  more likely that not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
during  we decided to discontinue the development of therapeutic antibodies to the complement protein properdin 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to the license to develop and commercialize antibodies to properdin 
the impairment charge was included in research and development expenses on our statement of operations 
in  management determined that an impairment of our acquired technology in the field of catalytic antibodies had occurred and that the estimated value had declined to zero 
this technology  which includes intellectual property  was acquired in through the acquisition of hesed biomed  inc we decided to focus our resources on other research and development projects and decided to wind down our catalytic antibody program 
additionally  after assessing the associated patent position and the likelihood of sale or license of the technology to a third party  management further determined that the possibility of generating positive future cash flows from the technology was remote 
as a result of this determination  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended june  as of december   we have determined that no changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that an additional impairment of an intangible asset had occurred 
if we were to determine in a future period that an impairment of intangible assets has occurred  the impairment measurement procedures could result in a charge for the impairment of long lived assets 
as of december  the carrying value of our intangible assets was million 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the calculation of tax liabilities  the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
results of operations in each jurisdiction involve intercompany agreements between our canadian subsidiary and us parent 
such agreements could be unfavorably interpreted by the applicable taxing authorities  causing an increase in the income tax provision and an increase in our net loss 
the assessment of the income tax implications of this intercompany relationship requires significant management judgment 
stock option valuation the preparation of the notes to our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes to the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in lights of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   future minimum payments for certain contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  were as follows total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases      convertible notes due interest    convertible notes due interest    convertible note due   redeemable convertible preferred stock  amgen  purchase orders   total      amounts represent total of minimum payments for the entire period 
the million long term obligation to amgen consists of million in advances under the credit facility and  of interest 
we have a commitment to share equally all development and commercialization costs for panitumumab pursuant to our development and commercialization agreement with amgen 
as amended in october  that agreement provides that amgen will have decision making authority for development and commercialization activities and will make available to us in and up to million in advances that we may use to fund our share of development and commercialization costs for panitumumab after we have contributed million toward development costs in as of december   we had a carrying balance of million under this facility consisting of million in advances and  of interest accrued at the contract rate of per annum 
we have drawn a cash advance of an additional million in february we expect to continue to draw on this credit facility up to the million limit in the amount of any such advances  plus interest  may be repaid out of profits resulting from future product sales and we are generally not obligated to repay any portion of the loan if panitumumab does not reach commercialization 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative 
sfas no 
r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas no 
as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas no 
r  which is effective july   permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we expect to use the modified prospective transition method  which requires that compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date as well as for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for our share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and do not recognize compensation costs for our employee stock options 
accordingly  we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 
as shown in note of our consolidated financial statements under the heading of stock based compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate sensitivity on our investments in debt securities and our outstanding fixed rate debt 
the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid  investment grade and government debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and our goal is to maintain an average maturity of approximately one year 
in addition  as of december   we had million of outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in  and million of outstanding convertible senior notes due in the fair value of these convertible notes may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  as well as changes in the market price of our common stock 
a hypothetical per annum decrease in interest rates would result in an adverse net change in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
equity price risk 
we are exposed to equity price risk on strategic investments  such as those we have made in curagen and immunogen 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
with respect to curagen and immunogen  each of whose common stock is publicly traded  the aggregate market value of our investments in these securities was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
due to decreases in the market prices of the shares of curagen and immunogen  we recorded impairment charges of million in related to these investments 
the trading prices of shares of curagen and immunogen have fluctuated significantly since we purchased these securities 
each additional decrease in market value of these securities would result in a decrease in value of approximately million and million from the fair value of those investments at december  and  respectively 
additional price declines could cause us to record additional impairment charges in future periods
