when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires  develops  markets and sells prescription drugs through our us direct sales force and international distributors 
we focus on the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases and gastroenterological disorders  which are served by a limited group of physicians such as neurologists and gastroenterologists 
our strategy is to acquire or develop pharmaceutical products that we believe have sales growth potential  are promotionally responsive to a focused and targeted sales and marketing effort  complement our existing products and can be acquired at a reasonable valuation relative to our cost of capital 
in addition  through corporate collaborations  we intend to develop new medications focused on our target markets 
for the year ended december   our total revenues were million 
large multinational companies dominate the us prescription pharmaceutical market 
these companies tend to focus on drugs with annual sales in excess of billion and often divest products that  as a result of consolidation or lack of strategic fit  do not meet the threshold level of sales required for continued marketing and promotion 
since our inception  we have acquired and licensed products from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  schwartz pharma ag  nastech pharmaceutical company inc nastech and other pharmaceutical companies 
smaller drug development or biotechnology companies that do not have the capabilities to effectively market and sell food and drug administration fda approved products may also be sources of products 
since  we have introduced seven products and currently market four products in the united states 
we promote certain of our products through our nationwide sales and marketing force  targeting high prescribing specialty physicians such as gastroenterologists  bariatric surgeons  and neurologists  and select primary care physicians 
we contract with third parties for the manufacture  warehousing  and distribution of our products 
our current products are hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  nascobal  the only prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and glofil  an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function 
consistent with our efforts to focus on sales and marketing  our spending on research and development activities has been modest 
we have entered into several agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain acquired technology 
in june  we signed a definitive license agreement with fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc fabre kramer of houston  texas  whereby we granted fabre kramer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize hypnostat tm intranasal triazolam for the treatment of insomnia and panistat tm intranasal alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorders 
we have a development agreement with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel of south san francisco  california for our antiviral drug discovery program  and a development agreement with 
table of contents dainippon pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
dainippon of osaka  japan for our antibacterial program 
in  no revenues were received  and no significant expenses were incurred as a result of these agreements 
we have rights to the following registered trademarks hp acthar gel  ethamolin  nascobal and glofil we also have the following unregistered trademarks migrastat tm  emitasol tm  hypnostat tm and panistat tm 
pramidin is owned by sirton pharmaceuticals spa sirton 
emitasol is approved in italy as pramidin and has been marketed in the past by sirton 
each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
questcor is the surviving corporation of a merger between cypros pharmaceutical corporation and ribogene  inc ribogene 
the merger was completed on november  our principal office is located at whipple road  union city  california and our telephone number is our corporate internet address is www

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 
strategy we believe that our ability to market  develop and acquire prescription products and our ability to focus our promotional efforts  product development programs and overall company resources in limited therapeutic areas uniquely positions us to continue to grow 
the key elements of our strategy include increase sales of products through targeted promotion 
we seek to increase sales by promoting certain of our products to high prescribing specialty physicians through our nationwide sales and marketing force 
our current target audience for nascobal is gastroenterologists  bariatric surgeons and neurologists  and neurologists for acthar 
product usage and recommendations by these specialists generally influence usage by primary care physicians 
identify and license or acquire prescription products 
we seek to acquire the rights to pharmaceutical products that we believe will i benefit from increased marketing efforts directed at high prescribing specialty physicians  ii leverage our existing sales infrastructure  and iii complement our existing products 
since our inception  we have acquired or licensed seven products 
products to be considered for acquisition would have to be complementary to our existing products  synergistic with promotional efforts currently being undertaken by our sales force  and contribute to our gross margin 
we intend to purchase products with cash generated from operations  if any  from debt financings  or from capital raised through the sale of equity on terms acceptable to us 
develop and market new or improved formulations of prescription products that complement our target therapeutic areas and sales strategy 
we intend to fund development with cash generated from operations  if any  and corporate collaborations 
marketed pharmaceutical and related healthcare products our marketed products as of december  include acthar  which we acquired in july  nascobal  which we acquired in june  ethamolin  which we acquired in november  glofil  which we acquired in august  and vsl  which we acquired the rights to market and sell pursuant to a promotion agreement effective january the vsl promotion agreement expired effective january acthar 
hp acthar gel acthar is a natural source  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth 
unlike synthetic acth  acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
it works by stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete the natural endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
acthar is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the treatment of infantile spasm is  periodic flares associated with ms  and various forms of arthritis  collectively called joint pain 
although the fda 
table of contents approved package labeling does not mention is  acthar has been used to treat this condition 
we believe is is the disease with the most compelling need for acthar treatment 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasm generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the market for is therapies has not changed much over the last several years 
acthar remains the treatment of choice  however  acthar s availability in the several years before our acquisition of the drug from aventis was very restricted 
as such  many physicians used synthetic steroids and even sought to obtain vigabatrin from canada  an unapproved product in the united states 
vigabatrin  an enzyme inhibitor  is marketed under the trade name sabril in canada 
a symposium on is  sponsored by the child neurology society  discussed the fact that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
the proceedings of that symposium have been made available to all pediatric neurologists as a continuing medical education monograph 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience painful  episodic flares 
during  we began to promote acthar as an alternative to intravenous methylprednisolone  a corticosteroid  for the treatment of exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is currently the treatment of choice for this indication 
the primary advantage of acthar in this setting is that it provides the patient with the freedom and convenience of intramuscular or subcutaneous administration at home  rather than the intravenous administration of methylprednisolone  without sacrificing efficacy or tolerability 
sales promotion of acthar for joint pain is not anticipated at this time 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteriods  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasms and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
solu medrol  the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms flare  is now available to patients after an announced shortage in nascobal 
in june  we acquired nascobal  an fda approved nasal gel formulation of cyanocobalamin usp vitamin b  from nastech  a leading formulation science company 
we began distributing nascobal in july we are marketing nascobal for patients with ms and crohn s disease  as well as for patients who have undergone bariatric surgery  since these patients are at high risk of developing severe deficiencies of vitamin b due to a compromised ability to absorb vitamin b through the gastrointestinal system 
cyanocobalamin is one of the b cobalamin class of vitamins 
cyanocobalamin is the principal member of the class  and the most widely employed in medicine in the united states 
it is currently commercially available over the counter in an oral formulation and by prescription in injectable and nasal formulations 
the diets of most adult americans provide the recommended intake of vitamin b  but deficiency can still occur 
vitamin b deficiency has a number of causes  including malabsorption of vitamin b resulting from structural or functional damage to the gastrointestinal system  caused by surgery or various disease states 
vitamin b deficiency of this type has traditionally been treated with an intramuscular injection of vitamin b most individuals who develop a vitamin b deficiency resulting from structural or functional damage to the gastrointestinal system have an underlying stomach or intestinal disorder that limits the absorption of vitamin b characteristic signs of vitamin b deficiency include fatigue  weakness  nausea  constipation  flatulence gas  loss of appetite and weight loss 
deficiency also can lead to neurological changes such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet 
additional symptoms of vitamin 
table of contents b deficiency are difficulty in maintaining balance  depression  confusion  poor memory and soreness of the mouth or tongue 
sometimes the only symptom of these intestinal disorders is anemia resulting from vitamin b deficiency 
dietary deficiency of vitamin b has also been seen in strict vegetarians but this type of deficiency can be treated with oral vitamin b supplements 
currently in the united states approximately million injection dosages of vitamin b are prescribed annually to address all causes of vitamin b deficiency 
although the potential market for the use of nascobal is large  we have initially focused our promotional efforts on patients who through surgery or as a result of disease cannot readily absorb vitamin b  including patients susceptible to a vitamin b deficiency caused by crohn s disease  gastric bypass surgery or ms 
people with crohn s disease may have difficulty absorbing vitamin b because of intestinal inflammation 
crohn s patients who have had both a primary and secondary surgical resection of their small bowel may develop vitamin b deficiency 
vitamin b deficiency can also predate surgery in crohn s patients 
a study in patients with crohn s disease found that up to of those who had not had surgery showed signs of vitamin b deficiency  probably due to the malabsorption caused by the disease itself 
surgical procedures of the gastrointestinal tract  such as surgery to remove all or part of the stomach  often result in a loss of cells that secrete stomach acid and intrinsic factor  a substance normally present in the stomach 
surgical removal of the distal ileum  a section of the intestines  also can result in the inability to absorb vitamin b individuals who have had either of these surgeries usually require lifelong supplemental vitamin b to prevent a deficiency 
in the us alone there are approximately  crohn s patients  of which approximately  are candidates for vitamin b therapy 
gastric bypass surgery is a surgical procedure performed on morbidly obese patients 
obesity is a major health problem in the united states and it is estimated that over million americans are classified as morbidly obese 
to assist with weight loss  bariatric surgeons perform a variety of surgical procedures on the stomach and intestines designed to restrict or limit the intake of food 
as a result of these procedures  the absorption of vitamin b through diet is extremely limited 
in fact  approximately of patients two years after surgery had significant vitamin and mineral deficiency 
in  it is estimated that  gastric bypass surgeries were performed and the number of procedures is expected to increase in a study of ms patients found that over had abnormally low serum vitamin b levels 
cerebral spinal fluid levels of vitamin b were also reduced in patients with ms 
it is speculated that vitamin b associated transmethylation may be an important component in the demyelination that is characteristic of ms 
over  people in the us have ms 
vitamin b deficiency may also result from a variety of disease states 
it is estimated that of the us population approximately  people will develop pernicious anemia in their lifetime 
pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin b pernicious anemia occurs when there is an absence of intrinsic factor  a substance normally present in the stomach 
vitamin b deficiency is found in up to of patients over years old 
another study suggests that approximately half of americans over can not absorb the vitamin b contained in their food 
among the estimated  hiv and aids patients in the us  to or approximately  people are vitamin b deficient 
current maintenance treatment for vitamin b deficiency calls for injections of vitamin b once per month for life 
this chronic need for vitamin b replacement therapy often requires frequent trips to a health care professional s office or visits by a home health care professional to receive injections 
nascobal gel is the only intranasal vitamin b available  and is the only non injectable prescription vitamin b therapy 
it is administered once a week which can enhance compliance and provide more consistent blood levels than monthly injections of vitamin b nascobal is covered by most major pharmaceutical benefit programs 
in september  the fda approved our request to have nascobal labeled for first line use for all vitamin b deficiencies except pernicious anemia 
previously  the approved nascobal labeling required the initial stabilization of vitamin b levels with injectable vitamin b before switching to nascobal 

table of contents nascobal is manufactured for us by nastech under a long term supply agreement 
the purchase price is adjusted annually based on increases in nastech s raw materials costs and the producer price index for pharmaceutical preparations 
as part of our acquisition of nascobal  we also acquired the rights to nascobal nasal spray  a new dosage form  for which a new drug application nda was filed by nastech with the fda in december the fda approved the nda for nascobal nasal spray in february nascobal competes in the market for vitamin b replacement therapy 
this market on a unit basis is dominated by inexpensive generic vitamin b injections 
the vitamin b injection requires the additional expense of a doctor s office visit once a month 
some patients may also receive over the counter vitamin b tablets or sublingual formulations of vitamin b  however  the effectiveness of tablets and sublingual formulation is questionable in the patients for whom nascobal is marketed 
ethamolin 
end stage liver disease  also known as hepatic cirrhosis  results in approximately  deaths annually in the united states 
hepatic cirrhosis promotes the formation of enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  through development of portal hypertension 
when portal venous blood pressure rises  the varicosities that develop may cause life threatening upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and are associated with a high mortality rate 
at least  patients in the united states have either actively bleeding esophageal varices or esophageal varices that are at imminent risk of bleeding 
early and effective treatment of esophageal varices to achieve hemostasis is essential to a favorable outcome in a bleeding patient 
the most common pharmaceutical treatment protocol involves the injection of a sclerosing agent into the varix  achieving clot formation and obliteration of the varix 
sclerotherapy agents are chemicals that are injected into varicose veins that damage and scar the inside of the vein  causing it to close 
this form of hemostasis is called sclerotherapy and usually requires multiple treatment sessions 
ethamolin is the only sclerotherapy agent approved by the fda for the treatment of esophageal varices that have recently bled 
however  there is strong competition from band ligation  a form of surgery that is becoming the treatment of choice for this emergent clinical condition 
at the present time  we are not actively promoting ethamolin 
ethamolin is manufactured for us by ben venue laboratories ben venue on a purchase order basis 
the purchase price is based on ben venue s costs at the time of manufacture 
several companies may offer less expensive sclerotherapy agents that compete with ethamolin 
however  ethamolin is the only product which is fda approved for treating esophageal varices 
other competitive agents include scleromate tm an injectable agent used to treat varicose veins and spider veins  rubber band ligation methods procedures in which bleeding esophageal varices are tied off at their base with rubber bands  cutting off the blood flow such as the multi band superview manufactured by boston scientific  the multi band six shooter manufactured by wilson cook medical inc  and the multi band ligator manufactured by bard 
other products may reduce the number of bleeding esophageal varices by lowering portal hypertension  such as sandostatin manufactured by novartis 
the competition to market fda approved active bleeding esophageal varices therapies is intense 
glofil glofil is approved by the fda for measuring glomerular filtration rate gfr  a measurement of kidney function 
nephrology  transplant  oncology and nuclear medicine departments at major medical centers are the primary users of glofil glofil is an injectable radioisotope diagnostic agent  which provides rapid information on gfr with great accuracy 
radioisotopes have very short half lives and require special handling 
present diagnostic procedures for measuring kidney function include serum creatinine and creatinine clearance tests 
these two tests are the most commonly performed methods of measuring kidney function because of their low cost 
however  both methods may significantly overestimate kidney function in the estimated  patients with severe renal disease 
the utility of glofil has been established in published clinical studies as being a more direct and accurate measure of kidney function yielding much more reliable results than serum creatinine or creatinine clearance tests 
this improved accuracy can be essential in monitoring disease progression  implementing appropriate interventions and assessing the degree of success of kidney grafts  post transplant 
however  most early stage patients are not deemed to require this degree of accuracy in the determination of renal function 

table of contents due to its high degree of accuracy  glofil has also been used in clinical trials administered by the national institutes of health nih 
use of glofil in clinical trials can provide the trial administrators with an accurate measure of kidney function and illustrate the effects of the drug being studied on normal kidney function 
the biggest impediment to future growth in the sales of glofil is the current lack of availability of the test to practicing clinicians  because routine testing with glofil requires dedicated laboratory facilities and trained technicians 
due to the lack of strategic fit  the promotional efforts on glofil are limited to supporting existing users 
glofil is manufactured for us by iso tex diagnostics  inc iso tex from whom we purchase on a lot by lot basis 
the purchase price is based on iso tex s costs at the time of manufacture 
there are numerous products that may be viewed as competitors to glofil these include intrinsic tests  such as serum creatinine tests and creatinine clearance tests  both of which are used to measure how quickly the kidneys are able to clear creatinine  an endogenously produced chemical from the blood 
extrinsic tests use such products as omnipaque an injectable contrast media agent  manufactured by sanofi  a division of sanofi synthelabo  and conray iothalamate meglumine another injectable contrast medium  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc there is intense competition among both fda and non fda approved products to measure kidney function 
vsl we acquired us promotion rights from vsl pharmaceuticals  inc for vsl under an agreement effective january vsl is a patented over the counter probiotic preparation of eight live freeze dried lactic acid bacterial species 
probiotics are living organisms in foods and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
we formally launched vsl to the market as a dietary supplement to promote normal gastrointestinal gi function at the annual digestive disease week meeting in may we purchased vsl products from sigma tau pharmaceuticals  inc sigma tau pharmaceuticals at a fixed price 
effective january   vsl pharmaceuticals  inc assigned the promotion agreement for vsl to sigma tau pharmaceuticals 
sigma tau pharmaceuticals entered into a promotion agreement with inkine pharmaceutical company  inc inkine 
under the terms of the agreement  sigma tau pharmaceuticals paid inkine a fixed fee to promote vsl to gastroenterologists 
in  we may have benefited from this increased promotion effort in that we were responsible for taking orders and shipping vsl directly to customers 
as such  we recognized the revenues for the sales of vsl in the united states regardless of which company promoted the product 
the promotion agreement expired in january in accordance with its terms  as sigma tau pharmaceuticals has chosen to assume promotional efforts for vsl inulin 
due to minimal demand  increasing production costs and lack of strategic fit  we discontinued marketing and selling inulin in september in december we sold the inulin product and marketing rights 
drug development our development stage products include the intranasal drugs emitasol  hypnostat and panistat 
intranasal drugs emitasol through our merger with ribogene  we acquired emitasol  an intranasal form of metoclopramide  which is an approved antiemetic available in oral and intravenous forms to treat diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent acute chemotherapy induced emesis 
we  through future strategic partners  may also choose to investigate emitasol for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy 
emitasol was developed and marketed in certain countries throughout the world through corporate partners 
it is approved in italy as pramidin  and during approximately  units were distributed by 
table of contents sirton under our license agreement in italy for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis 
this agreement expired in accordance with terms in june we entered into a marketing agreement in december with ahn gook pharmaceuticals ahn gook  for intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in korea 
ahn gook also signed an agreement with sirton to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide finished product 
emitasol has been approved in korea  and is distributed by ahn gook in korea for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis  on a hospital by hospital basis 
in the united states  emitasol could be proposed as a method to control diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent delayed onset emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy 
in  the fda approved merck s emend aprepitant with ht antagonist for various indications  including delayed onset emesis  and mgi pharma s aloxi palonsetron hydrochloride for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy 
given these approvals  our potential to develop emitasol for delayed onset emesis has diminished 
at the present time  due to high development costs  we have no plans to investigate or develop further uses of emitasol 
hypnostat and panistat through our merger with ribogene  we acquired hypnostat  an intranasal form of triazolam for the treatment of insomnia  and panistat  an intranasal alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorders 
in june  we signed a definitive license agreement with fabre kramer  whereby we granted fabre kramer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize hypnostat and panistat 
immediately after the license agreement was signed  we received a cash payment of  for the transfer of all technology related to the products 
we are entitled to future payments from fabre kramer when specific developmental milestones are met 
in we received a milestone payment from fabre kramer of  which we recognized as revenue as there were no continuing obligations 
we will also receive a milestone payment upon the acceptance of a new drug application and the approval of a new drug application for hypnostat and panistat  provided fabre kramer has not entered into an agreement prior to these events 
if fabre kramer has entered into an agreement  we will share the payments received by them under the agreement 
in addition  we are entitled to a share of future worldwide product related fabre kramer revenues  based on a percentage of total revenues 
no further payments have been received and fabre kramer has informed us that development efforts have ceased 
fabre kramer intended to develop panistat for the management of panic disorder or the short term relief of anxiety symptoms 
we believe that panistat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating panic disorders 
to date  no clinical work has been performed on panistat 
we believe it will be several years  if ever  before panistat is commercially available 
glial excitotoxin release inhibitors geris the geris are neuroprotective compounds that may prevent ischemic brain damage originating from astrocytes astroglial cells 
astrocytes serve important metabolic functions and are thought to be responsible for the bulk of brain swelling following stroke or injury 
the geri compounds were being funded by a small business innovation research sbir grant from the nih 
the grant was terminated on july  we do not intend to expend any additional resources on these compounds nor do we expect to realize license fees or revenues from such programs 
other strategic alliances and collaborations the dainippon agreement we have an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with dainippon to use our antibacterial peptide deformylase and ppgpp degradase technology for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we have retained the right to co promote  in europe and the united states  certain products resulting from the arrangement 
we will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones up to the amount of million in japan and million in one other major market 
the first milestone payment will occur upon the initiation of a human clinical trial 
table of contents using a compound included in the agreement 
we will receive a potential royalty on net sales that will range from to  depending on sales volume and territory 
dainippon has been conducting research on two specific bacterial targets  peptide deformylase and ppgpp degradase 
to date  dainippon has focused most of their efforts on the deformylase project 
their efforts on the ppgpp degradase project have ended 
several compounds have been synthesized and tested in vivo against drug resistant bacteria 
although the compounds have shown good in vivo activity  dainippon has not selected any compounds for clinical studies in animals 
there can be no assurance that dainippon will ever select any compounds for preclinical studies or if selected that these compounds will eventually be approved as drugs 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with dainippon 
the rigel pharmaceuticals agreement we have an exclusive agreement with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel to use our antiviral technology 
under the agreement  we have assigned to rigel certain antiviral technology  including our hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site and nsa drug discovery technology  for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we will be entitled to potential future milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones  including the selection of a compound developed under the agreement for submission as an investigational new drug  and royalty payments on sales 
the status of this project is on going at rigel 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with rigel 
licenses and distribution agreements csc pharmaceuticals handels gmbh csc 
in april  ribogene entered into an agreement with csc which was assigned to us upon our merger with ribogene 
the agreement grants csc an exclusive license to market and sell emitasol in austria  poland  the czech republic  bulgaria  russia  hungary  the slovak republic  romania  and the remaining community of independent states and eight other eastern european countries 
csc has agreed to pay us a royalty based on net sales within the countries listed above 
the agreement will expire on a country by country basis years after the first commercial sale in that country 
although we can terminate the license if csc did not obtain approval in any country contained in the agreement by april   we have not done so  since csc has filed for regulatory approval in austria  russia  hungary and the slovak republic 
in  csc received approval to market emitasol in poland and the czech republic 
csc has also filed for approval in several other countries 
as of the end of  csc has not begun to market emitasol in poland and the czech republic and has no immediate plans to do so 
it is difficult to predict when  if ever  csc will begin to market emitasol in their approved territories 
laboratorios silesia sa 
in december  we signed a license agreement with laboratorios silesia sa for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in chile 
laboratorios silesia sa also signed an agreement with sirton to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide finished product under the trade name pramidin 
this product is marketed as pramidin in italy 
we received a small up front payment and will receive royalties on net sales  if any  of emitasol in this territory 
the product was submitted for approval in chile and was rejected 
as of december  the status of this product remains uncertain 
ahn gook pharmaceutical co  ltd 
ahn gook 
we entered into a license agreement in december and amended in december with ahn gook for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed in korea under the trade name emitasol 
ahn gook received government approval to market emitasol in and began selling in the republic of korea in the first half of through  the sales of the product have been minimal 
ahn gook intends to manufacture emitasol in korea 
we received an up front cash payment of  in and a milestone payment of  in upon transfer of technology and will earn future royalties based on actual sales in korea 
in december  we expanded the license agreement to include twelve additional countries in asia and since we have no future obligations  we 
table of contents recognized  in revenues related to the up front cash payment and milestone payment under the agreement 
we did not receive payments or royalties under this agreement in or manufacturing we do not currently manufacture any of our acquired products 
our commercial products  acthar  nascobal  ethamolin and glofil  are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials using active pharmaceutical ingredient api purchased from aventis aventis api 
we began shipping this lot to customers in september we have now produced a total of three commercial acthar lots at cbl using aventis api 
in  we transferred the acthar api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
in late  we filed an nda supplement with the fda seeking approval for the api manufacturing site transfer 
the fda has approved our use of aventis api in the production of acthar finished vials until the api manufacturing site transfer is approved 
we expect to use the biovectra api in to produce finished acthar product for commercial use once the fda approves the api manufacturing site transfer 
based on internal sales forecasts  our existing inventory of the aventis api should be adequate to supply the annual demand for acthar through we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which requires minimum production totaling million during the term of the agreement 
the agreement terminates on december  and includes two one year extension options 
the production of acthar api and finished vials are subject to inspection and ultimate approval by the fda 
while we have reviewed our plans and progress to date with the fda  and received a positive response  additional approvals are required 
the fda approved our supplemental new drug application filed on september  to extend the labeled shelf life of acthar from twelve months to months from the date of manufacture 
we have selected a new contract laboratory to perform three bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
two of these bioassays have been successfully transferred to the contract laboratory  and we are awaiting fda approval of these two transfers 
we have experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of the third assay  potency 
zlb behring zlb has agreed to support questcor through by continuing to conduct the two bioassays until we receive fda approval  and conduct the potency testing and assist us on the potency assay transfer 
work on the potency assay transfer is planned to restart by mid there are no assurances that we will be successful in transferring this assay 
if we are unable to efficiently and timely validate the potency assay prior to the end of  we will not be able to release both api and finished vials  and therefore we may not be able to meet the expected demand for acthar 
the transfer of manufacturing from aventis to our new contract manufacturers results in higher unit costs than the fixed price manufacturing agreement with aventis  which decreases our gross margins on sales of acthar 
nascobal is manufactured for us by nastech under a long term supply agreement 
the purchase price is adjusted annually based on increases in nastech s raw materials costs and the producer price index for pharmaceutical preparations 
nastech manufactures nascobal at its fda approved  current good manufacturing practice cgmp manufacturing facility in hauppauge  new york 
during  we successfully transferred the manufacturing of ethamolin from schering plough to ben venue 
we obtained fda approval for the transfer to ben venue in september ben venue manufactures ethamolin for us on a purchase order basis 
we believe we have sufficient product on hand to cover demand through late a new lot of ethamolin is scheduled to be manufactured by mid our manufacturer of glofil was subject to an fda inspection in june as a result of this inspection  the fda placed our manufacturer back onto a normal two year inspection cycle 
the fda had 
table of contents previously placed the manufacturer on a yearly inspection cycle as a result of fda inspections conducted prior to there can be no assurance that any of our api or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness or the fda s cgmp requirements 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain fda approval for the acthar api manufacturing site transfer  nor that our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of api or finished forms of our products may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for any of our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
sales and marketing as of december   we have hired  trained and deployed a total of product specialists and sales and marketing personnel to support the commercialization of our primary promoted products  acthar and nascobal 
our strategic focus in was neurology and gastroenterology 
our promotion and educational efforts for acthar are focused on pediatric neurologists and on a subset of high potential neurologists dedicated to the treatment of multiple sclerosis in adults 
we market nascobal to physicians who treat patients at high risk of developing deficiencies of vitamin b our priority targets for nascobal are gastroenterologists crohn s disease  bariatric surgeons gastric bypass surgery  neurologists ms  dementia and a select number of primary care physicians 
each of these physician specialists sees a high number of patients with a compromised ability to absorb vitamin b through the gastrointestinal system 
we are not actively marketing ethamolin and glofil at this time 
international distribution agreements beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
in october we signed an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
beacon of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
sales to beacon were   and  in  and  respectively 
idis limited in november  we signed an agreement with idis limited idis of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar  ethamolin and nascobal on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia and new zealand where acthar and ethamolin are sold through a distributor and the uk where acthar is sold through beacon 
sales to idis in were  there were no sales to idis in competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with acthar  nascobal  ethamolin and glofil moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition and commercialization of products 

table of contents most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that are currently in the development stage  when they are approved  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products the processes carried out in the production of pharmaceutical products by pharmaceutical firms  including manufacturers from whom we purchase products  are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 
drug products must be manufactured  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with current cgmps 
the fda may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
drugs in development our products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca and the public health service act  and foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us and current or potential development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we have obtained patent coverage  either directly or through licenses from third parties  for nascobal and some of our products in development or marketed overseas 
we currently own one us patent that is scheduled to expire on april   covering certain formulations of nascobal 
we could face increased competition in connection with our nascobal gel formulation from competitors entering the market after expiration of the us patent on 
table of contents april  we hold the right to have assigned to us two pending patent applications in the us for a new spray formulation of nascobal and related technology 
we own eighteen issued us and foreign patents covering hypnostat and panistat  seven issued us and foreign patents covering emitasol  and eight issued us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
we acquired intellectual property associated with our intranasal program  including emitasol for diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis associated with chemotherapy  migrastat intranasal propranolol for migraine treatment  and intranasal benzodiazepines such as hypnostat and panistat for various conditions such as anxiety  seizures  panic attacks and sleep disorders 
we have licensed rights to intranasal metoclopramide in italy  chile  south korea  austria  the russian federation  asia excluding japan and certain former eastern european countries 
the former italian licensee  sirton  received approval to market intranasal metoclopramide pramidin in italy 
the agreement with sirton expired according to terms in june there can be no assurance that the foreign licensees will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market emitasol  or that  in the event such approvals are obtained  emitasol will achieve market acceptance in such countries  or that we will ever realize royalties on sales of emitasol in such countries 
we also have a number of patent applications currently pending in patent offices around the world on our various products and expect to file additional applications in the future

we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

we make available free of charge through our website our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and all amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with  or furnished to  the sec  by providing a hyperlink to the sec s website directly to such reports 
risk factors we have a history of operating losses and may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we have a history of recurring operating losses 
our accumulated deficit through december  was million  of which million represented the net loss applicable to common shareholders for the twelve months ended december   million represented the net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december   and million represented the net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  operating losses are expected to continue at least through the end of to date  our revenues have been generated principally from sales of acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl in july  we began selling nascobal  a product that we acquired in june we discontinued selling inulin in september the promotion agreement for 
table of contents vsl expired in january and we will no longer be selling vsl we do not expect emitasol  hypnostat or panistat to be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations will be dependent in large part upon our ability to develop  finance and implement an effective promotional strategy for current products  finance and acquire additional marketed products  finance operations with external capital until consistent positive cash flows are achieved  obtain fda approval for the acthar api manufacturing site transfer and the transfer of the acthar bioassays  continue to receive products from our sole source contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at acceptable costs  continue to control our operating expenses  and ensure customers compliance with our sales and exchange policies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  or if we are unable to contain costs and expenses  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if our revenues from product sales decline or fail to grow  we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
we rely heavily on sales of acthar and nascobal 
we expect to continue to rely on sales of these products in we review external data sources to estimate customer demand for our products 
in the event that demand for our products is less than our sales to wholesalers  excess inventory may result at the wholesaler level  which may impact future product sales 
if the supply of acthar or nascobal available at the wholesale level exceeds the future demand  our future revenues from the sales of acthar or nascobal may be affected adversely 
we monitor the amount of acthar and nascobal at the wholesale level as well as prescription data obtained from third party sources to help assess product demand 
although our goal is to actively promote acthar and nascobal  and we have no reason to believe that our promotion of acthar and nascobal will not be successful  we cannot predict whether the demand for acthar and nascobal will continue in the future or that we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar and nascobal 
we may choose  in the future  to reallocate our sales and promotion efforts for acthar and nascobal which may result in a decrease in revenues from one or both of the products 
if the demand for acthar or nascobal declines  or if we are forced to reduce the prices  or if exchanges of expired products are higher than anticipated  or if we are forced to re negotiate contracts or terms  or if our customers do not comply with our existing policies  our revenues from the sale of acthar or nascobal would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  and we are unable to raise the price correspondingly  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our revenues from the sale of acthar or nascobal decline or fail to grow  our total revenues  gross margins and operating results would be harmed and we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
if we are unsuccessful in completing the acthar manufacturing site transfer  we may be unable to meet the demand for acthar and lose potential revenues 
any delays or problems associated with obtaining fda approval for the acthar api manufacturing site transfer or the transfer of the three bioassays including potency to a new contract laboratory could reduce the amount of the product that will be available for sale and adversely affect our operating results 
in  we 
table of contents signed an agreement with cbl  a contract manufacturer for acthar finished product  and transferred the final fill and packaging process from aventis to cbl 
we also produced our first lot of acthar finished vials using the aventis api in we have now produced a total of three commercial acthar lots at cbl using aventis api 
in  we transferred the acthar api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
in late  we filed an nda supplement with the fda seeking approval for the api manufacturing site transfer 
the fda has approved our use of aventis api in the production of acthar finished vials until the api manufacturing site transfer is approved 
use of aventis api is conditioned on the results of yearly re testing meeting current api specifications 
we expect to use the biovectra api in to produce finished acthar product for commercial use once the fda approves the api manufacturing site transfer 
based on internal sales forecasts  our existing inventory of the aventis api should be adequate to supply the annual demand for acthar through however  if demand exceeds our forecasts  if fda approval of the acthar api manufacturing site transfer is delayed  or if the aventis api yearly re testing results fail to meet current api specifications  we could be unable to meet demand and we could lose potential revenues 
the production of acthar api and finished vials are subject to inspection and ultimate approval by the fda 
while we have reviewed our plans and progress to date with the fda  and received a positive response  additional approvals are required 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer has several risks that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results in future years 
such risks include the ability of the new contractors to produce api in sufficient quantities  on a timely basis  at an acceptable cost  that meet the potency specification  and the possibility that the production facility and the process will be not be approved by the fda 
although we believe that the acthar api manufacturing site transfer will be successful  there can be no assurance that the manufacturing site transfer will be approved by the fda and that the transfer will not have a materially adverse impact on the company in the future 
we have selected a new contract laboratory to perform three bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
two of these bioassays have been successfully transferred to the contract laboratory  and we are awaiting fda approval of these two transfers 
we have experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of the third assay  potency 
zlb has agreed to support questcor through by continuing to conduct the two bioassays until we receive fda approval  and conduct the potency testing and assist us on the potency assay transfer 
work on this assay transfer is planned to restart by mid there can be no assurances that we will be successful in transferring this assay 
if this laboratory is unable to validate this specific assay  we may be forced to find a new contractor to complete this work  which in turn could increase our costs substantially 
if we are unable to efficiently and timely validate the potency assay before the end of  we will not be able to release api and finished goods and therefore we may not be able to meet the expected demand for acthar 
once the fda approves the acthar api manufacturing site transfer  the cost of the product will increase which will cause our gross margins to decline 
in addition  if the approvals by the fda do not occur on a timely basis  we could lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose the fda approval of our products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
if our customers do not comply with our product exchange policy or demand that we implement a credit memoranda return policy for product lots covered by our product exchange policy  our revenues would be significantly impacted 
our product exchange policy is applicable to production lots released prior to june   under which we ship replacement product for expired product returned to us within six months after expiration 
the standard policy in the industry is to issue credit memoranda in exchange for expired product 
the three largest wholesalers to which we sell have expressed dissatisfaction with our product exchange policy and  although they have complied to date  our ability to enforce this policy on wholesalers whose influence within the 
table of contents pharmaceutical industry and resources are far greater than ours may prove to be difficult 
since we sell a majority of our products to the three largest wholesalers and no viable alternatives currently exist  we may be forced to change our product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy in which credit memoranda are issued for all returns currently subject to the product exchange policy 
in the event this occurred  the negative financial impact on our revenues  operations and cash position would be substantial in the near term 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a transition plan for expired product returns from the product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy for the return of expired product within six months beyond the expiration date 
expired product returned from lots released after may  are subject to this credit memoranda return policy in which a credit memoranda will be issued for the original purchase price of the returned product 
should this transition plan to a credit memoranda return policy not be adhered to and we are forced to issue credit memoranda for all returns currently subject to the product exchange policy  the reserves for credit memoranda would be significantly increased  with an offset to gross product sales at the time of the policy change 
this change in policy would have a significant negative financial impact at the time of the change  reducing gross product sales by the amount of the estimated future credit memoranda to be issued  offset by a reduction in cost of product sales for the elimination of the reserve for product replacement 
due to the short shelf life of acthar months  significant quantities could expire at the wholesale or pharmacy level  which could then be returned for replacement product under our product exchange policy  or credit memoranda under our credit memoranda return policy 
we are actively monitoring inventory levels at the wholesalers and have implemented a plan designed to minimize the amount of returns of expired product 
however there can be no assurance that our actions will be effective in reducing the return of expired product or minimizing the negative impact on receivables and future sales 
such shipment of replacement product may displace future sales 
see the critical accounting policies section in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition for further discussion of our product exchange and credit memoranda return policies 
if our customers do not comply with the terms on which we extend them credit  our cash flows and ability to fund operations may be adversely impacted 
certain wholesalers are not complying with our product exchange policy 
these wholesalers are deducting from amounts owed to us the full price of expired acthar they plan to return 
while we reached an agreement with the three largest wholesalers to pay these short remittances returns receivable upon their receipt of replacement product for the acthar that expired in november  may and december  these wholesalers have continued to deduct from amounts owed to us the full price of expired acthar they return to us 
additionally  certain wholesalers received an administration fee from us for the expired product that was exchanged 
certain wholesalers have continued to short remit for expired product returns in and as of december   the returns receivable amount is  as of december   replacement units have been shipped with respect to approximately of the amounts owing to us and we are seeking reimbursement from these wholesalers 
the next acthar lot expires in may  the next ethamolin lot expires in january and the next nascobal lot expires in february we expect that the wholesalers will continue to short remit us in the future as these lots and other lots expire and they seek to return expired product 
should these wholesalers not reimburse us for the returns receivable upon shipment of replacement product  the negative impact on our cash and operations would be substantial 
most of our revenues  and consequently our receivables  are derived from the three largest us drug wholesalers 
as of december   of our accounts receivable excluding allowances was attributable to these three wholesalers 
consequently  our cash flows and ability to fund operations are highly dependent on these wholesalers financial ability and willingness to pay amounts due on a timely basis 
should these wholesalers in particular not reimburse us for returns receivable upon shipment of replacement product  or not pay us amounts due on a timely basis for any reason  the negative impact on our cash and operations would be substantial 

table of contents we have little or no control over our wholesalers buying patterns  which may impact future revenues  exchanges and excess inventory 
we sell our products primarily through major drug wholesalers located in the united states 
consistent with the pharmaceutical industry  most of our revenues are derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
these wholesalers represented over of our gross product sales for fiscal year while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at the three largest wholesalers using inventory data obtained from them  historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
we rely solely upon the wholesalers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
there can be no assurance that these wholesalers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid outages or inventory build ups 
on occasion we note that the wholesalers buy quantities of product in excess of the quantities being sold by them  resulting in increasing inventories 
our therapeutic pharmaceutical products have expiration dates that range from to months from date of manufacture 
we will generally accept for exchange or credit pharmaceutical products returned within the six month period following the expiration date 
we establish reserves for these exchanges or credit memoranda at the time of sale 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately forecast the reserve requirements needed to provide for exchanges or credit memoranda issued in the future 
although our estimates are reviewed quarterly for reasonableness  our product return activity could differ significantly from our estimates because our analysis of product shipments  prescription trends and the amount of product in the distribution channel may not be accurate 
judgment is required in estimating these reserves 
actual amounts could be significantly different from the estimates and such differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
we do not control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of the drug wholesalers who purchase our products 
these are sophisticated companies that purchase our products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and perceived business interests 
our sales are subject to the purchase requirements of the major wholesalers  which  presumably  are based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any customer  during any period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of one or more of our products during the same period  resulting in increases or decreases in product inventory existing in the distribution channel 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or otherwise impaired inventory 
reserves for excess finished goods and work in process inventories are based on an analysis of expected future sales that will occur before the inventory on hand expires 
reserves for raw material inventories are based on viability and projected future use 
judgment is required in estimating reserves for excess or impaired inventories 
actual amounts of required reserves could be different from the estimates and such differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
our inability to secure additional funding could lead to a loss of your investment 
we raised gross proceeds of million through a private placement of series b preferred stock in january  million through a private placement of common stock in june  and million and the surrender of outstanding warrants through a private placement of common stock in january we anticipate that our capital resources based on our internal forecasts and projections will be adequate to fund operations and capital expenditures through at least december   unless our fiscal year revenues are less than we expect 
in february  nastech was successful in obtaining approval for the nda covering the nasal spray formulation and in february  million was paid to nastech 
if the patent covering the nasal spray formulation issues after the approval of the nda  we would be required to pay an additional million to nastech 
on april   we will be required to redeem our convertible debentures  which have a face value of million  for cash  or a combination of million in cash and the remainder in common stock 
if we experience unanticipated cash requirements  or if revenues are less than we expect  or we are required to make the milestone payment to nastech before december   we could be required to raise additional funds 
regardless  we may seek additional funds before the end of  through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
additionally  we may seek to raise capital whenever conditions 
table of contents in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
there can be no assurance that additional funds can be obtained on desirable terms or at all 
if revenues from product sales are less than we expect or if further capital resources are not available  or if such resources cannot be obtained on attractive terms to us  this may further limit our ability to fund operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  the cost and timing of the acthar site transfer  achieving better operating efficiencies  maintaining customer compliance with our policies  obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers and completing the site transfer to new contract manufacturers  and acquiring or developing additional products 
we may obtain additional financing through public or private debt or equity financings 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to reduce our operations or to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our products or manufacturing efforts 
if we are unable to contract with third party contract manufacturers  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our marketed products  acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  and glofil and other products that we may develop  commercialize or acquire in the future 
contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
ethamolin is currently manufactured by ben venue 
we do not have a formal ethamolin manufacturing contract with ben venue  however we have an agreement on terms and conditions  and we purchase product on a purchase order basis under these agreed upon terms and conditions 
glofil is manufactured by iso tex from whom we purchase on a lot by lot basis 
nascobal is manufactured by nastech under a long term supply agreement 
see if we are unsuccessful in completing the acthar manufacturing site transfer  we may be unable to meet the demand for acthar and lose potential revenues for discussion of third party contract manufacturers of acthar 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our required products and services on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if the required approvals by the fda and other regulatory authorities do not occur on a timely basis  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose fda approval of our products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
if our third party distributors are unable to distribute our products or the costs to distribute our products increase substantially  we will lose potential revenues and profits 
we transferred certain product distribution functions  including warehousing  shipping and quality control studies  to third party distributors 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may experience difficulties at the third party contractor level that could reduce  delay or stop shipments of our products 
if we 
table of contents encounter such distribution problems  our products could become unavailable and we could lose revenues  or the costs to distribute these products could become higher than we anticipated 
in fiscal year  of our gross product sales were derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
two of these three wholesalers instituted a distribution fee for handling our products during as a result  our distribution costs increased by  if other wholesalers institute similar fees  or if such fees increase in magnitude in the future  our costs to distribute products will increase  and our gross profit margins will decline 
the company has experienced changes in key personnel which will have an uncertain impact on future operations

james l 
fares and our executive vice president of commercial development  mr 
steve cartt 
if we were to lose mr 
fares or mr 
cartt  as employees  our business could be harmed 
we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
although some changes in staffing levels are expected during  recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  financial operations  business development  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
our commercial products and our products in the development stage may not be accepted by the market  which may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully developed  will compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize the products that we may develop or that our corporate partners may develop 
the degree of market acceptance of our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payers  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 

table of contents a large percentage of our voting stock is beneficially owned by a small number of stockholders  who in the future could attempt to take control of our management and operations or exercise voting power to advance their own best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
sigma tau finanziaria spa and its affiliates sigma tau beneficially own  directly or indirectly  approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock  and they beneficially own  including shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a convertible debenture  approximately of our outstanding common stock  as of march  additionally  as reported on amendment no

accordingly  these stockholders  acting individually or together  could control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership may  at a minimum  have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of us by a third party 
it may also place us in the position of having these large stockholders take control of us and having new management inserted and new objectives adopted 
if competitors develop and market products that are more effective than ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
for example  there are products on the market that compete with acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  and glofil moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of ours  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  and to develop  acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection  or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for clinical development  manufacturing  and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions will compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
if our competitors succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we develop or acquire  our technology and future drugs may be rendered obsolete and noncompeti 
table of contents tive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the fda or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we will 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market specific products 
we do not know if drugs resulting from the joint efforts of our existing or future collaborative partners will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development or whether we will obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere 
if we fail to maintain or enter into new contracts related to collaborations and in licensed or acquired technology and products  our product development and commercialization could be delayed 
our business model has been dependent on our ability to enter into licensing and acquisition arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology for commercialization or marketed products 
if we are unable to enter into any new agreements in the future  our development and commercialization efforts will be delayed 
disputes may arise regarding the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license and acquisition agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  current license and acquisition agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
if collaborators do not commit sufficient development resources  technology  regulatory expertise  manufacturing  marketing and other resources towards developing  promoting and commercializing products incorporating our discoveries  the progress of our licensed products development will be stalled 
further  competitive conflicts may arise among these third parties that could prevent them from working cooperatively with us 
the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities by the parties could depend on the achievement of milestones by us and otherwise generally may be controlled by other parties 
in addition  we expect that our agreements with future collaborators will likely permit the collaborators to terminate their agreements upon written notice to us 
this type of termination would substantially reduce the likelihood that the applicable research program or any lead candidate or candidates would be developed into a drug candidate  would obtain regulatory approvals and would be manufactured and successfully commercialized 
if none of our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products  or if we do not receive milestone payments or generate revenues from royalties sufficient to offset our significant investment in product development and other costs  then our business could be harmed 
disagreements with our collaborators could lead to delays or interruptions in  or termination of  development and commercialization of certain potential products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which could be time consuming and expensive and may result in lost revenues and substantial legal costs which could negatively impact our results from operations 
in addition  if we are unable to acquire new marketed products on a timely basis at an appropriate purchase price and terms  we may not reach profitability and may not generate sufficient cash to fund operations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and 
table of contents are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
we currently own one us patent that is scheduled to expire on april   covering certain formulations of nascobal 
we could face increased competition in connection with our nascobal gel formulation from competitors entering the market after expiration of the us patent on april  the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
since we must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that our corporate partners or we develop  impose significant additional costs on our corporate partners and us  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and decrease our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are 
table of contents subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
our ability to generate revenues is affected by the availability of reimbursement on our products  and our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from third party payors 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and private insurance plans 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may also impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic is approved  the reimbursement status and rate of such a product is uncertain 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for existing products may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for our products may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products  which could result in lower product sales or revenues  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
in the united states  proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such changes enacted may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
the medicare prescription drug improvement act  enacted in december  provides for  among other things  an immediate reduction in the medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs administered in a physician s office 
the medicare act  as well as other changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for our products  may reduce or eliminate reimbursement of our products costs 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in several states and local metropolitan areas 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to innovative medicines  the market acceptance of these products may be reduced 
we are unable to predict what impact the medicare act or other future legislation  if any  relating to third party reimbursement  will have on our product sales 
to facilitate the availability of our products for medicaid patients  we have contracted with the center for medicare and medicaid services 
as a result  we pay quarterly rebates consistent with the utilization of our products by individual states 
we also give discounts under contract on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
if these discounts and rebates become burdensome to us and we are not able to sell our products through these channels  our net sales could decline 

table of contents our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the american stock exchange  have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to prepare to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations for fiscal years ending on or after july  regarding our management s required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation of that assessment will require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
although management believes that ongoing efforts to assess our internal control over financial reporting will enable management to provide the required report  and our independent auditors to provide the required attestation  under section  we can give no assurance that such efforts will be completed on a timely and successful basis to enable our management and independent auditors to provide the required report and attestation in order to comply with sec rules effective for us 
moreover  because the new and changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our common stock  like that of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
our stock price has ranged in value from to over the last two years 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation  the quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings or losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  our ability to obtain product from our contract manufacturers  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business will expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and for those products we currently market 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to  however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted

we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires  develops  markets and sells prescription drugs through our us direct sales force and international distributors 
we focus on the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases and gastroenterological disorders  which are served by a limited group of physicians such as neurologists and gastroenterologists 
our strategy is to acquire or develop pharmaceutical products that we believe have sales growth potential  are promotionally responsive to a focused and targeted sales and marketing effort  complement our existing products and can be acquired at a reasonable valuation relative to our cost of capital 
we currently market four products in the united states hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  nascobal  the only prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  including vitamin b deficiencies associated with crohn s disease  gastric bypass surgery and ms  
table of contents ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and glofil  an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function 
we have also marketed vsl and inulin 
our promotion agreement for vsl expired in january in accordance with its terms 
vsl will be promoted in the future by sigma tau pharmaceuticals  inc sigma tau pharmaceuticals  an affiliate of sigma tau finanziaria spa sigma tau  a significant shareholder and affiliate of the company 
due to minimal demand  increasing production costs and lack of strategic fit  we discontinued marketing and selling inulin in september in june we acquired nascobal  a food and drug administration fda approved nasal gel formulation of cyanocobalamin usp vitamin b  from nastech pharmaceutical company inc nastech for million 
we began distributing nascobal in july we are marketing nascobal for patients with ms and crohn s disease  and patients who are at high risk of developing severe deficiencies of vitamin b due to a compromised ability to absorb vitamin b through the gastrointestinal system 
we are also marketing nascobal for patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery or other conditions that lead to a malabsorptive state 
consistent with our focus on sales and marketing  our spending on research and development activities has been modest 
expenses incurred for the acthar manufacturing site transfer and medical and regulatory affairs are classified as research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we have entered into several agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain acquired technology 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million at december  at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  the results of our sales efforts  demand for our products by patients and consumers  inventory levels of our products at wholesalers  timing of expiration of our products and the resulting shipment of replacement product under our product exchange policy  future credit memoranda to be issued under our credit memoranda return policy  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the timing of certain expenses  the acquisition of marketed products  the establishment of strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements and the receipt of milestone payments 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales reserves  product returns  bad debts  inventories  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales reserves  product returns  and rebates we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies  government chargebacks for goods purchased by certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  medicaid rebates to all states for products purchased by patients covered by medicaid  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for existing 
table of contents products and data obtained from external sources 
for new products  we estimate our reserves for product returns  government chargebacks and rebates on specific terms for product returns  chargebacks and rebates  and our experience with similar products 
we have a product exchange policy in which we will ship replacement product for expired product returned to us within six months after expiration 
the estimated costs for such potential exchanges  which include actual product costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of product sales 
in estimating returns for each product  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii current inventory on hand at wholesalers and the remaining shelf life of that inventory ranging from months to years for all products except glofil and vsl  which are not subject to our product exchange policy  and iii changes in demand measured by prescriptions or other data as provided by an independent third party source and our internal estimates 
for glofil and vsl  we accept no returns for expired product 
we routinely assess our historical experience including customers compliance with our product exchange policy  and we adjust our reserves as appropriate 
our product exchange policy is not commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry 
the standard policy in the industry is to issue credit memoranda in exchange for expired product 
the three largest wholesalers to which we sell have expressed dissatisfaction with our product exchange policy 
during the second quarter of we implemented a transition plan for expired product returns from the product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy for the return of expired product within six months beyond the expiration date 
expired product returned from production lots released prior to june  continues to be subject to the product exchange policy 
expired product returned from lots released after may  are subject to the credit memoranda return policy in which a credit memoranda will be issued for the original purchase price of the returned product 
we commenced shipping a new lot of acthar in june and a new lot of nascobal in july  which are subject to the credit memoranda policy 
a reserve for the sales value of estimated returns on shipments of acthar and nascobal product lots released and shipped after may  has been recorded as a liability in the amount of  as of december  with a corresponding reduction in gross product sales 
this reserve reflects an estimate of future credit memoranda to be issued for acthar and nascobal  applied to the quantity of product shipped from lots subject to the credit memoranda return policy 
the reserve will be reduced as future credit memoranda are issued  with an offset to accounts receivable 
in estimating the return rate for expired product subject to credit memoranda  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii current inventory on hand at wholesalers and the remaining shelf life of that inventory  and iii changes in demand measured by prescriptions and other data as provided by an independent third party source and our internal estimates 
a new lot of ethamolin is not expected to be released until late  at which time a reserve for credit memoranda will be estimated and recorded as a reduction of gross product sales based upon the quantity of product shipped 
this will reduce the future amount recorded as net product sales 
a transition period will extend through between the existing product exchange policy  applicable to product lots released prior to june   and the new credit memoranda return policy  applicable to product lots released after may  the product exchange policy will continue through the return period six months after expiration for all product lots released prior to june  these return periods end as follows acthar  june  nascobal  may  ethamolin  october the credit memoranda return policy commenced with the actual release of product lots of acthar in june and nascobal in july  and will apply to the actual release of an ethamolin lot currently planned for late planned releases of products are subject to change 
reserves for the estimated credit memoranda applicable to future returns related to sales from these product lots will be recorded as shipments occur  and will reduce gross product sales 
until the transition from our product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy for expired product is complete in  both the product exchange policy and the credit memoranda return policy will be in effect at the same time  which will result in lower revenues than historically experienced due to the additional impact of displacement of future sales from the product exchange policy and reduction of gross product sales for the reserves under the credit memoranda return policy 

table of contents if our transition to a credit memoranda policy for returns is not adhered to  our options may be limited 
we could either not sell our products to wholesalers or we could be forced to issue credit memoranda for all returns currently subject to the product exchange policy 
if we are forced to issue credit memoranda for all returns currently subject to the product exchange policy  the reserves for credit memoranda would be significantly increased  with an offset to gross product sales at the time of the policy change 
the reserve would be based on an estimate of the future credit memoranda to be issued based upon historical return rates by product  applied to the quantity of product sold that has not yet expired 
in the event this occurred  the negative impact on our revenues  operations and cash position would be substantial in the near term 
further  if such a policy change were made  the currently recorded reserve for product replacements would be eliminated resulting in a reduction of cost of product sales 
certain wholesalers have deducted the full price of expired product which they planned to return from the amounts owed to us returns receivable 
we reached an agreement with the three largest wholesalers to accept replacement product and pay the amounts previously deducted in return for an administration fee  however it remains their standard practice to deduct from payments to us the sales value of expired product that they have requested authorization to return 
as of december   our returns receivable is  primarily due to return materials authorization requests for expired product from acthar lots that expired in may and january and ethamolin lots that expired in october  january and february wholesalers have indicated that they will reimburse us for these deductions upon the replacement of expired units in accordance with our product exchange policy  however  in our experience the timing of such reimbursements is slower than the collection of our normal trade receivables 
as of december   replacement units have been shipped with respect to approximately of the amounts owing to us and we are seeking reimbursement from these wholesalers 
as long as the wholesalers standard practice is to deduct amounts related to the return of expired product  a returns receivable will arise 
should the wholesalers not comply with our product exchange policy  the amounts deducted by them for returns may not be collectible  and we would need to increase our allowance for bad debts 
in estimating medicaid rebates  we match the actual rebates to the quantity of product sold by pharmacies on a product by product basis to arrive at an actual rebate percentage 
this historical percentage is used to estimate a rebate percentage that is applied to the sales to which the rebates apply to arrive at the rebate expense reserve for the period 
in particular  we consider allowable prices by medicaid 
in estimating government chargeback reserves  we analyze actual chargeback amounts by product and apply historical chargeback rates to sales to which chargebacks apply 
we routinely assess our experience with medicaid rebates and government chargebacks and adjust the reserves accordingly 
for qualified customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
allowances for cash discounts are estimated based upon the amount of trade accounts receivable subject to the cash discounts 
if actual product returns  government chargebacks  medicaid rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  or if the wholesalers fail to adhere to our exchange or credit memoranda policy  additional reserves may be required 
to date  actual amounts have been consistent with our estimates 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for excess and obsolete inventory due to the expiration of shelf life of a product 
in estimating inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  we analyze on a product by product basis i the expiration date  ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual future usage and demand for our products are less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write offs may be required in the future 
as part of our agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis to acquire acthar  in fiscal year we purchased for approximately  the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api and other raw material ingredients owned by aventis 
as of december   there was approximately  of aventis api remaining in our inventory 
the fda approved our use of aventis api in the 
table of contents production of acthar finished vials until the api manufacturing site transfer is approved 
use of aventis api is conditioned on the results of yearly re testing meeting current api specifications 
we filed a new drug application nda supplement with the fda seeking approval for the api manufacturing site transfer  and if approval is obtained  we may write off the aventis api as excess inventory 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to purchased technology and goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill and other intangible assets with no definitive lives for impairment on an annual basis  using the two step approach 
for the year ended december   we tested the recorded goodwill including assembled workforce for impairment 
the assembled workforce was generated from the merger with ribogene inc  and represented the value of the employees that we retained subsequent to the merger 
the carrying value of the assembled workforce at the time of the merger was based upon the cost to replace the retained employees 
in evaluating the assembled workforce  we determined that the cost to replace the remaining employees would be minimal 
hence  we concluded that the remaining assembled workforce was impaired and the carrying value of  related to the assembled workforce was written off in the fourth quarter of the impairment loss is included in selling  general and administrative in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we will continue to monitor the carrying value of the remaining goodwill through the annual impairment tests 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total revenues years ended december  increase decrease in s net product sales contract research  grant and royalty revenue technology revenue total revenues total revenues for the year ended december  increased  or  from the year ended december  due to increases in net product sales  as explained below 
for the year ended december   net product sales increased by  or  from the year ended december  the increase in net product sales is primarily the result of revenue from a full year of sales of nascobal  which was acquired in june  and also reflects higher net product sales of acthar  ethamolin and vsl in addition  net product sales for fiscal year include  of shipments to wholesalers in january for orders received in december we expect quarterly fluctuations in the net sales of all our products due to the timing of shipments  changes in wholesaler inventory levels  expiration dates of products sold  the timing of replacement units shipped under our exchange policy  the impact of reserves provided for under our credit memoranda return policy and the reallocation of promotional efforts for each product 

table of contents acthar for the year ended december   net product sales of acthar increased from the year ended december  increased acthar net product sales resulting from increased demand in the fourth quarter of and a higher average selling price as compared to fiscal year were offset in part by reserves recorded under our credit memoranda return policy initiated in the second quarter of during fiscal year  reserves for credit memoranda for acthar and nascobal totaling  were recorded as a reduction to gross revenue 
the estimated demand for acthar as measured by prescriptions reported from an independent source increased by in as compared to the demand for acthar increased significantly in the fourth quarter of as compared to each of the previous three quarters in the higher level of volume in the fourth quarter of did not continue beyond february our product exchange policy for expired product remains in effect for lots of acthar released prior to june  during fiscal year  under our product exchange policy we replaced vials of acthar with an estimated sales value of  calculated using the unit prices in effect at december  the acthar returns which were replaced were from lots which expired in may and january the replacement of expired product  at no cost to the customers  displaced sales in fiscal year and is expected to continue to displace sales as product expires and is subsequently replaced 
in addition  until the transition from our product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy is complete in  both the product exchange policy and the credit memoranda return policy will be in effect at the same time 
this will result in lower revenues than historically experienced due to the additional impact of displacement of future sales from the product exchange policy and reduction of gross product sales for the reserves under the credit memoranda return policy 
the next lot of acthar expires in may and replacements for the expired acthar relating to this lot  and the lot that expired in december  will occur in fiscal year during fiscal year  under our product exchange policy we shipped replacement units of expired products with an estimated sales value of million calculated using the unit prices in effect at december  in fiscal year and fiscal year  our acthar vials sold had a one year shelf life and in the first quarter fiscal year we began shipping acthar with an month shelf life 
due to the short shelf life of acthar  significant quantities could expire at the wholesaler or pharmacy level  which would then be returned for replacement product under our product exchange policy  or for credit under our credit memoranda return policy 
nascobal nascobal was acquired in june  and sales commenced in july net product sales of nascobal for the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of a full year of sales for and expanded promotional efforts focused on this product in the increase in nascobal net sales in fiscal year was partially reduced by the reserves recorded under our credit memoranda return policy 
we commenced shipments of a new lot of nascobal in july  which are subject to the credit memoranda return policy 
during fiscal year  reserves for credit memoranda for nascobal and acthar totaling  were recorded as a reduction to gross product sales 
ethamolin for the year ended december   net product sales of ethamolin increased from the year ended december  the increase was partially the result of lower shipments in the first quarter of resulting from the impact of advanced buying by wholesalers in mid after we pre announced a price increase 
from the date of notification of the price increase through june   we received  of ethamolin orders  which we believe were in excess of actual prescription needs and negatively impacted sales in the remainder of fiscal year and fiscal year 
table of contents during the year ended december   under our product exchange policy we replaced units of ethamolin at no cost having a sales value of approximately  calculated using the unit prices in effect at december  the demand for all sclerosing agents as measured by total prescriptions increased in fiscal year by approximately from fiscal year  and the increase in demand for ethamolin was approximately 
in fiscal year we did not actively promote ethamolin and we do not expect to actively promote the product in fiscal year vsl for the year ended december   net product sales of vsl increased from the year ended december  in january  our vsl promotion agreement expired in accordance with its terms 
the product will be promoted in the future by sigma tau pharmaceuticals 
glofil for the year ended december   net product sales of glofil decreased by from the year ended december  in fiscal year  we did not actively promote glofil and do not intend to actively promote it in the future 
inulin for the year ended december   sales of inulin decreased by from the year ended december  due to minimal demand  increasing cost of production and lack of strategic fit  we discontinued marketing and selling inulin in september during the year ended december   we sold our remaining inulin inventory for  contract research  grant and royalty revenue we did not recognize any contract research  grant and royalty revenue for the year ended december  contract research  grant and royalty revenue in fiscal year represented reimbursement under our small business innovation research sbir grant related to our glial excitotoxin release inhibitors geri compound research project 
our sbir grant terminated in july technology revenue we did not recognize any technology revenue for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recognized  in technology revenue primarily from our license agreement with fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc fabre kramer and the sale of certain patents 
cost of product sales cost of product sales increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of product sales includes material cost  packaging  warehousing and distribution  product liability insurance  royalties  quality control  quality assurance and estimated provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
the increase in cost of product sales is primarily due to increases in material costs as a result of higher product sales in fiscal year  increases in product stability testing costs of  and increases in distribution costs of  during fiscal year  two of the largest wholesalers began charging a fee for distribution services provided to us 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  write offs and allowances related to the discontinuation of sales of inulin and the short shelf life of acthar were recorded 
stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and ethamolin and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred and are expected to increase as more lots of acthar and ethamolin are produced and become subject to testing 
we expect per unit material costs for acthar to increase in the future due to higher contract manufacturing and laboratory costs 

table of contents cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  a change in the mix of products we sold contributed to this decrease 
in april  we decided to outsource certain functions previously performed in our carlsbad  california distribution center  including  but not limited to  warehousing  shipping and quality control studies 
we have entered into agreements with various vendors to distribute acthar  nascobal  ethamolin and glofil  and we distributed vsl from our union city facility 
the decision to outsource these functions and close the carlsbad facility resulted in reduced expense in fiscal year gross margins the gross margins for all products increased to of net sales for fiscal year from of net sales for fiscal year for the year ended december   acthar  nascobal and ethamolin gross margins were relatively comparable 
vsl and glofil had relatively lower gross margins as compared to the other products 
the lower gross margins in fiscal year reflect the write off of inulin inventory upon discontinuation of sales in september  and allowances for excess inventory recorded in fiscal year that were related to the short shelf life of acthar 
the increase was also partly due to the transition from our product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy which was implemented during the second quarter of under our product exchange policy  returns are included in cost of product sales 
under the new credit memoranda return policy  reserves for credit memoranda applicable to future returns are recorded as a reduction of gross product sales 
the shutdown of our carlsbad distribution center in fiscal year and the outsourcing of certain functions previously performed at that location also contributed to the increase in gross margins in fiscal year we expect per unit material costs for acthar to increase in the future due to higher contract manufacturing and laboratory costs  which we anticipate could decrease our gross margin on acthar 
gross margins do not include allocation of the amortization of purchased technology for the related products 
amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative years ended december  increase in s selling  general and administrative expense percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or from the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in dollars is primarily due to approximately  in severance and related expenses associated with the departure of our former ceo in the third quarter of  the write off of  related to the impairment of assembled workforce  increases in sales commissions of  and access fees to sigma tau pharmaceuticals of  due to higher product sales  and an increase of  in board of director fees due to increased oversight activities related to executive transitions during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by decreases in legal  consulting and investor relations expenses of approximately  and bad debt expense of  as compared to the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the costs included in research and development relate primarily to our manufacturing site transfers and medical and regulatory affairs compliance activities 
the decrease primarily resulted from the closure costs incurred in the third quarter of 
table of contents when we ceased use of our carlsbad distribution facility and recorded charges associated with the closure  offset by increased regulatory fees related to nascobal  which we introduced in july for the year ended december   we incurred approximately  of acthar site transfer costs  a decrease of approximately  as compared to the year ended december  in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
in  we transferred the acthar api manufacturing process to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
we also selected a new contract laboratory to perform three bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
two of these bioassays have been successfully transferred to the contract laboratory  and we are awaiting fda approval of these two transfers 
we have experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of the third assay  potency 
in  we conducted additional studies aimed at identifying critical differences in the way the potency assay is performed at the contract laboratory as compared with the previous laboratory 
some differences were identified and corrected  however results were still not acceptable 
work on this assay transfer is planned to restart by mid in fiscal year  the costs which we plan to incur related to the api manufacturing site transfer and the bioassay transfers are expected to be less than the costs incurred in in fiscal years and  our spending on research and development programs was modest 
we are seeking to out license the development of emitasol intranasal metoclopramide  a product that is approved in italy and korea as an anti emetic 
the development of hypnostat for the treatment of sleep disorders and panistat for the treatment of panic disorders is controlled by fabre kramer 
the future development of emitasol will depend in part on our ability to enter into a partnership arrangement 
as we rely on current and future strategic partners to develop and fund our non commercial projects  we are unable to project estimated completion dates 
we have limited control  if any  over these programs due to our reliance on partners for their development 
accordingly our ability to disclose historical and future costs associated with these projects is limited 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the amortization of the purchased technology related to the nascobal product acquisition for million in june the nascobal purchased technology is being amortized over years

during fiscal year  under our product exchange policy we replaced vials of acthar with an estimated sales value of million calculated using the unit prices in effect at december  the replacement of expired product displaced sales in fiscal year the decrease of unit sales over the prior year was also partially due to a shipment in early fiscal year of backorders totaling  outstanding as of december  the estimated demand as measured by prescriptions reported from an independent source increased by in as compared to under our product exchange policy for expired product  during fiscal year we replaced vials of acthar which expired in november and may during fiscal year under our product exchange policy we shipped replacement units for expired product with an estimated sales value of  calculated using unit sales prices in effect at december  in fiscal year and fiscal year  our acthar vials sold had a one year shelf life and in the first quarter fiscal year we began shipping acthar with an month shelf life

cash requirements based on our internal forecasts and projections  we believe that our cash on hand at december   and the net cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund operations through at least december   unless a substantial portion of our cash is used for product acquisition or our revenues are less than we expect 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of product sales  returns of expired product  the acquisition and licensing of products  technologies or compounds  if any  our ability to manage growth  timing of the payment to nastech relating to the patent approvals for the nasal spray formulation of nascobal  competing technological and market developments  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  the receipt of licensing or milestone fees from current or future collaborative and license agreements  if established  the timing of regulatory approvals  the timing and successful completion of the acthar site transfer  payment of dividends and compliance to prevent additional dividend events  any expansion or acceleration of our development programs or optional redemption events  and other factors 
if our revenues do not grow and provide cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to meet our obligations  or if we do not have sufficient funds to redeem the convertible debentures  which have a face value of million  for cash  or a combination of cash and stock  upon maturity in april  or if we are unable to 
table of contents maintain compliance with certain covenants and thus avoid the payment of additional dividends of to the holders of our series b convertible preferred stock  or we do not have sufficient funds to make the contingent payment  if  and when due to nastech for the patent approvals of the new nasal spray form of nascobal  or if we have insufficient funds to acquire additional products or expand our operations  we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
however  traditional asset based debt financing has not been available on acceptable terms 
additionally  we may seek to raise additional capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on desirable terms or at all

recently issued accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement  instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments 
sfas no 
r is effective generally for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date  to awards that are unvested as of the effective date  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original sfas no 
will apply this revised statement 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and will adopt this statement at the effective date 
we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements
