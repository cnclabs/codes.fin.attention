these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially depending upon a variety of factors  including continued market demand for the types of products and services produced and sold by the company 
general overview the company is a designer and manufacturer of large scale  complex stamping die systems used to form sheet metal parts 
most of the stamping die systems  sold by the company  are used in the high speed production of automobile and truck body parts such as doors  frames  structural components and bumpers 
a majority of the company s sales are to daimlerchrysler  ford motor company  general motors corporation  mercedes benz  bmw and their tier one suppliers of sheet metal stamped parts and assemblies 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity include revenue recognition using percentage of completion estimates and the assessment of asset impairments 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on time and material contracts utilizing the completed contract method 
revenue is recognized on all other contracts utilizing the percentage of completion method 
under the completed contract method  the contract is considered complete when all costs except for insignificant items have been incurred and the project has been approved by the customer 
under the percentage of completion method  estimated contract earnings are based on total estimated contract profits multiplied by the ratio of labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours on the contract 
provisions for total estimated losses on contracts in process are recognized in the period such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period such revisions are determined 
net book value of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
this review is performed using estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
new accounting standards in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payments that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be re measured each reporting period 
compensation costs will be recognized over the period that an employee provides services in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
sfas no 
r becomes effective at the beginning of our fiscal year ending august  we expect that the impact of adopting sfas no 
r will not be material 
basis of presentation the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
during  the company sustained a loss from operations of  and a net loss of  this loss resulted in an accumulated deficit of  as of august  these factors  among other things  raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company believes that the revolving line of credit and the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs through fiscal however  depending on the company s level of future sales  terms of such sales  financial performance and cash flow of existing contracts  such financing may not be sufficient to support operations 
therefore  the company may be required to seek additional sources of funding 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
an asset is deemed impaired and written down to its fair value if estimated related total future undiscounted cash flows are less than its book carrying value 
in performing our evaluation of long lived assets for impairment  we utilized undiscounted cash flows based on the assets estimated remaining useful lives 
in developing the projections  we estimated revenues for each year and estimated resulting margins based upon various assumptions including future market pricing trends and historical financial costs 
the analysis concluded that the estimated total undiscounted future cash flows were in excess of the carrying value of long lived assets 
had the analysis concluded that the total undiscounted future cash flows been below the carrying value  an impairment charge of the difference between the carrying value and the lower of the total discounted cash flows or fair value would have been recorded 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
total revenue decreased from approximately million in to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of the company experiencing a low contract backlog of million as of august   which resulted in a decrease of in shop floor hours and lower sales in fiscal the company s backlog of awarded contracts  which are all believed to be firm  was approximately million and million as of august  and  respectively  an increase of 
the company expects all backlog contracts will be reflected in sales during fiscal years ending august  and cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold decreased from million for to million for and  as a percent of sales  decreasing from for to for direct costs materials and labor decreased by million  from million for to million for engineering expense decreased by million from million for to million for lastly  of the cost of goods sold  manufacturing overhead decreased by million from million for to million for additional details of these changes in cost of sales for and are as follows direct materials expense decreased from million for to million for and as a percent of sales from to 
this decrease was largely due to lower contract material requirements during as compared to during  the company s contract mix included an increase in die component machining work for the oems 
such contacts have lower direct material requirements as compared to construction contracts as the materials are supplied by the customer 
outside services expense decreased from million for to million for and as a percent of sales from to 
this decrease was largely due to the company incurring million of expense related to its outsourced projects in the balance of the outside services expense was due to lower sales volumes and internalizing of certain machining work  which was historically outsourced 
direct labor expense decreased by from million for to million for and  as a percent of sales  decreasing from to 
this change was a result of the company incurring a decrease in direct labor hours  from  hours in to  in of the total direct labor expense  regular or straight time decreased or million and  as a percent of sales  decreased from for to for overtime expense decreased or million  from million for to million for and  as a percent of sales  decreasing from for to for engineering expense decreased from million  or of sales  for to million  or of sales  for this decrease was largely as a result of a million decrease in engineering salaries and related payroll taxes expense 
manufacturing overhead was million or of sales for as compared to million or of sales for during  decreases in manufacturing overhead were largely attributed to decreases of  in labor and payroll tax expenses   in manufacturing supplies expense   in health and workers compensation insurance expense   in depreciation expense and  in building maintenance and supplies expense 
the increase of approximately of manufacturing overhead  as a percent of sales  was largely due to lower overhead absorption resulting from lower sales volumes in selling and administrative expense 
selling and administrative expense for increased to million or of sales  from million or of sales in this increase was largely a result of the company incurring an additional million in legal and professional fees during the largest increase related to the company s former primary lender  comerica bank  requiring the company to retain the services of a consulting company and reimburse the lender s legal counsel 
such expenses totaled approximately million 
the remaining increases in legal and professional expenses were incurred in regards to the company s litigation  refinancing and s filing 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million for to million for during the first three quarters of the company was under a forbearance agreement with its then primary lender comerica bank 
under such agreement the company was charged a higher interest rate on its debt from prime plus in to prime plus in as well as an additional million in forbearance fees during other expense subordinated debt financing costs 
during the third quarter of  the company retired its million subordinated debt with hillstreet capital 
this subordinated debt was paid prior to the scheduled retirement and resulted in the company expensing approximately million of debt issuance costs during these debt issuance costs were originally capitalized at the time of the transaction fiscal and were being amortized over the original repayment schedule 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
total revenue decreased from approximately million in to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of the company completing its significant tooling programs for a major european automaker for a sports utility vehicle and a new crossover vehicle to be manufactured in the united states 
the company s customer for these vehicles is the tier supplier to mercedes benz for these particular vehicles 
during the fourth quarter of  the company had significant difficulties in completing the contracts  which had a severe negative effect on revenue  cost of sales  and related earnings 
the company  due to many various circumstances  incurred significant cost overruns on many of the parts under the contracts 
many of these cost overruns involve customer timing changes  material specification changes and the company outsourcing the completion of many dies to meet customer deadlines 
all of the aforementioned issues resulted in the company incurring approximately million in additional outsourcing costs and million in additional labor costs 
the company accrued million of estimated losses on these contracts and others as of august  the outsourcing costs were incurred as a result of the company having certain bottlenecks in its production 
these bottlenecks were a result of changes to material specifications combined with an increase in the number of engineering changes required 
the material specification changes involved customer changes from a grade of steel the company had previous experience with to a new grade of high strength steel which  not only had the company had no experience working with  was also new to the customer 
as a result of this new material  the company could not simulate the flow of the steel in the dies 
due to the lack of historical data as to the material flow  the company  in some cases  had to re cut the dies up to eight times to get the part within specifications with this material 
this created capacity constraints in the company s machining and tryout areas 
as a result of these constraints  the customer required that the company utilize specified outside die shops to complete certain dies  which were constructed internally 
the customer decided that the company s internal capacity had become overburdened as a result of the rework being performed by the company to obtain part specifications with the new high strength steel 
had the company not outsourced this work  the customer may have cancelled the contracts and charged the company for all of the added costs incurred 
in addition  the customer may have discontinued the scheduled progress payments  which would have caused severe cash flow problems for the company 
management took the position that by outsourcing this work directly  the added costs were better controlled and prevented potential cash flow difficulties 
despite the aforementioned fourth quarter problems  the company did realize an overall profit on these two programs 
the total amount of revenue on these contracts was million with a net margin of million 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold decreased from million for to million for however  as a percent of sales  cost of goods sold increased from for to for direct costs materials and labor decreased by million  from million for to million for engineering expense remained consistent at million for both and lastly  of the cost of goods sold  manufacturing overhead remained consistent at million for versus million for additional details of these changes in cost of sales for and are as follows direct materials expense decreased from million for to million for and as a percent of sales from to 
this decrease was largely due to lower contract material requirements during as compared to outside services expense increased from million for to million for and increased as a percent of sales from to 
of the outsourced services expense for  approximately million of the million was in excess of amounts estimated for certain jobs and created extensive cost overruns on those particular jobs as described in the aforementioned revenue section 
direct labor expense increased from million for to million for and as a percent of sales  direct labor increased from to 
this change was a result of the company incurring a increase in direct labor hours  from  hours in to  in of the total direct labor expense  regular or straight time increased by million and as a percent of sales increased from for to for overtime expense increased from million for to million for and as a percent of sales increased from for to for the company incurred added labor costs of approximately million related to the construction and buy off difficulties noted above 
selling and administrative expense 
selling and administrative expense for increased by million to million as compared to million for as a percent of sales  selling and administrative expense increased from for to for this largely consisted of increases of  in administrative and sales salaries   in state of michigan single business tax   in deferred compensation expense and  in public company expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million for to million for this increase was largely due to the company incurring additional interest expense related to issuance of million subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal federal income tax 
the company s effective income tax rates were for the years ended august   and the company had approximately  of alternative minimum tax credits as of august   the use of which does not expire  and federal net operating loss carryforwards of  which expire  if unused  in fiscal  and the company has a valuation allowance of  and  at august  and  respectively  for net deferred tax assets  which may not ultimately be realized 
liquidity and capital resources 
for the fiscal year ended august   the company s cash flow generated from operating activities was million 
this largely resulted from a decrease of million in accounts receivable  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  a million increase in contracts in process and a million decrease in accounts payable 
from investing activities  the company incurred million in additions to property  plant and equipment and a million decrease in other assets consisting largely of debt financing costs  which were expensed prior to the scheduled amortization due to retirement of the related debt 
the company used net cash in financing activities of million 
the cash used in financing activities included the company s may  new senior financing with gross proceeds of million 
the company applied million to retire its previous senior debt facility with comerica bank  million to retire its subordinated debt with hillstreet  and million in fees to laurus new lender 
the net remaining funds  million  were utilized for general working capital purposes 
subsequent to this financing  the company has borrowed million under the convertible revolving working capital credit line to finance the increase in its contracts in process 
on may   the company entered into a new senior loan facility agreement with laurus as evidenced by the agreements 
pursuant to these agreements  the company received a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of million as well as a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of million 
each of the term loan and any loans under the revolving facility shall be convertible by laurus into shares of the company s common stock at a rate of per share 
in addition  as part of the agreement  the company issued an option to purchase  shares of its common stock at an exercise price of the company  in issuing an option for  shares at 
per share  triggered price protection provisions in previously issued warrants 
under the previous warrant agreements  if the company issued warrants or options below the strike price of the warrants  the exercise price of the outstanding warrants would adjust to the lower exercise price 
the company had previous warrants for  shares of common stock with  shares priced at an exercise price of per share and  priced at per share 
during  certain warrant holders exercised such warrants at the adjusted price and the company issued an additional  shares of common stock 
the company believes that the revolving line of credit and the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs through fiscal however  depending on the level of future sales  and the terms of such sales  an expanded credit line or other financial instruments may be necessary to finance increases in trade accounts receivable and contracts in process 
the company believes it will be able to obtain such expanded credit line and or other financing  if required 
the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of august less than more than total year years years years debt    operating lease      deferred compensation 
  capital lease    total obligations      interest obligations on the outstanding debt facilities are generally variable in nature 
the company s fixed interest rate obligations apply to debt totaling  inflation 
the company has no long term  fixed price supply contracts 
although the average set of dies takes approximately ten months from inception to shipment  any significant direct material costs are incurred at the beginning of the die manufacturing process 
historically  the company has been able to reflect increases in the prices of labor and material in its selling prices  however under current industry pricing pressures  the company is unsure if this will continue to be the case in the future
