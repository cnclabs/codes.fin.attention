item legal proceedings the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites  which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company s liability has been agreed 
the company is participating with other prps at all such sites  and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 
the company has accrued liabilities for all sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp  where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 
amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and  based upon current information  management believes it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

on may   officials from the european commission ec  assisted by officials from national competition authorities  launched unannounced inspections of and obtained documents from the company s pressure sensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany 
the investigation apparently seeks evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities affecting the european paper and forestry products sector  including the label stock market 
the company is cooperating with the investigation 
based on published press reports  certain other european producers of paper and forestry products received similar visits from european authorities 
one such producer  upm  stated that it had decided to disclose to competition authorities any conduct that has not comported with applicable competition laws  and that it had received conditional immunity in the european union and canada with respect to certain conduct it has previously disclosed to them  contingent on full cooperation 
in the course of its internal examination of matters pertinent to the ec s investigation of anticompetitive activities affecting the european paper and forest products sector  the company discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in its european operations 
this conduct violated the company s policies and in some cases constituted an infringement of ec competition law 
as a result  the company expects that the ec will fine the company when its investigation is completed 
the ec has wide discretion in fixing the amount of a fine  up to a maximum fine of percent of a company s annual revenue 
because the company is unable to estimate either the timing or the amount or range of any fine  the company has made no provision for a fine in its financial statements 
however  the company believes that the fine could well be material in amount 
there can be no assurance that additional adverse consequences to the company will not result from the conduct discovered by the company or other matters under ec or other laws 
the company is cooperating with authorities  continuing its internal examination  and taking remedial actions 
on july   the competition law division of the department of justice of canada notified the company that it was seeking information from the company in connection with a label stock investigation 
the company is cooperating with the investigation

the company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time  although the effect could well be adverse and material 
the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits  claims and inquiries  most of which are routine to the nature of the business 
based upon current information  management believes that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect the company

of the change in our diluted earnings per share 
the benefit from foreign currency translation reflected the strength of the euro  british pound  australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales  because our products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold 
as a result  the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses  thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income 
to reduce our exposure to those expenses in foreign currencies that do not match the related sales  we enter into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts  where available and appropriate

analysis of selected financial ratios we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance  as discussed in detail below 
working capital ratio working capital current assets minus current liabilities  as a percent of net sales was percent for compared to percent for  due to a decrease in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and payment of the steinbeis obligation 
working capital from continuing operations  as a percent of net sales which is a non gaap measure  was percent for compared to percent for  as shown below 
we utilize the working capital from continuing operations ratio as a measurement tool to assess our working capital requirements  because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing activities 
the timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period 
our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio  to maximize cash flow and return on investment 
working capital from continuing operations consists of in millions a working capital current assets minus current liabilities reconciling items short term and current portion of long term debt steinbeis obligation see note debt b working capital from continuing operations c net sales working capital  as a percent of net sales a c working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales b c the improvement in working capital from continuing operations in  as a percent of sales  was due to higher balances in accounts payable approximately million and other current liabilities approximately million

inventory ratio inventory turnover increased from in to in  calculated using a four quarter average inventory balance 
in  cost of products sold used in the ratio was calculated using a week year for comparability 
debt ratios our total debt to total capital was percent at year end compared to percent at year end this decrease was due to higher equity balances at the end of the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
when determining a credit rating  the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position  business outlook  consistency of cash flows  debt level and liquidity  geographic dispersion and management team

table of contents our accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased million in primarily due to a million benefit from foreign currency translation during the year  partially offset by an additional minimum pension liability of million  net of tax  for both our us and international pension plans

minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are included in the above table

we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites  which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon 
we are participating with other prps at all such sites  and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 
we have accrued liabilities for all such sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp  where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 
amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position  and based upon current information  we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized 
these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold  historical 
table of contents and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units  cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary

we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits  claims and inquiries  most of which are routine to the nature of the business 
based upon current information  we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 
we participate in receivable financing programs  both domestically and internationally  with several financial institutions whereby we may request advances from these financial institutions 
at january   we guaranteed approximately million of these advances 
in february  we entered into a five year operating lease on equipment that contains a residual value guarantee of million 
we do not expect the residual value of the equipment to vary significantly from the amount guaranteed 
we guaranteed up to approximately million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their suppliers as of january  in connection with the l e acquisition  we issued  shares at per share 
in the event the value of our common shares falls below the price of the shares that were issued to l e adjusted for dividends received  during the period from january  through december   we may be obligated to pay the difference in value  in the form of cash or common shares  to l e at our option 
capital spending plan we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million  funded through operating cash flows 
major projects in include investments for growth in asia and latin america  equipment and other investments for the rfid business  and both productivity and growth projects related to our north american roll materials operations 
related party transactions from time to time  we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties 
we believe that such transactions are at arm s length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
one of our directors  peter w 
mullin is the chairman  chief executive officer and a director of mc insurance services  inc mc  mullin insurance services  inc minc  and pwm insurance services  inc 
pwm  executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents 
mr 
mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc  minc and pwm collectively referred to as the mullin companies 
during  
table of contents and  we paid premiums to insurance companies for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with several of our employee benefit plans 
the mullin companies have advised us that mc  minc and pwm earned commissions from such insurance companies in aggregate amounts of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  for the placement and renewal of this insurance 
mr 
mullin had direct and indirect interests related to these commissions of approximately 
million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
the majority of these commissions were allocated to and used by mcp insurance services  llc an affiliate of mc to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under several of our employee benefit plans 
the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial holdings  inc mfh 
substantially all of the life insurance policies  which we placed through the mullin companies in and prior years  are issued by insurance companies that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance companies and a wholly owned subsidiary of mfh 
reinsurance returns earned by mfh can be negative or positive  depending upon the results of mfh s aggregate reinsurance pool  which is determined annually by mfh 
the mullin companies have advised us that in  they participated in reinsurance gains of mfh  of which approximately 
million of net gains were ascribed by mfh to our life insurance policies referred to above  and in which gains  mr 
mullin had direct and indirect interests of approximately 
million 
none of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and which require us to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves  inventory reserves  long lived asset impairments  pensions and postretirement benefits and income taxes 
revenue recognition sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
sales  provisions for estimated sales returns  and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers 
actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 
sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate 
volume  promotional  price  cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales 
rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold 
these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products 
we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy  historical experience and future expectations 
the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  
table of contents ii amounts based upon an aging schedule  and iii an estimated amount  based on our historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
no single customer represented percent or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end and however  approximately percent of our trade receivables at year end and were from eight customers of our office and consumer products segment 
the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
we use estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 
long lived asset impairments we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable 
impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value 
fair value is typically determined using an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
pensions and postretirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return  or health care costs  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
income taxes deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when establishing a valuation allowance  we consider future sources of income such as forecasted earnings  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and prudent and feasible tax planning 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if later it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency  interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
as a result  we enter into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs  when available and appropriate 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve our objectives  we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
in connection with the issuance of the million year senior notes in  we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately million 
the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over years  which corresponds to the term of the related debt 
additionally  we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations 
these amounts are not material to our financial statements 
in the normal course of operations  we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions  other risks associated with foreign operations  commodity price risk and litigation risks  which are not represented in the analyses that follow 
foreign exchange value at risk we use a value at risk var model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts 
this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
firm commitments  accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were included in the model 
forecasted transactions  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency 
the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks 
a percent confidence level was used for a one day time horizon 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately million at year end interest rate sensitivity an assumed basis point move in interest rates percent of our weighted average interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on our earnings
