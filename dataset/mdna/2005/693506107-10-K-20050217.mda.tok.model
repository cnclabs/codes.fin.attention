in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
among its many provisions  the ajca provides a limited opportunity in to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries at a us tax cost that may be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this provision on ppg and are awaiting final guidance from the internal revenue service to complete that evaluation  however  our current estimate is that the tax cost of any dividends we decide to pay in will not increase our effective tax rate significantly 
we have included the estimated net impact of the remaining provisions of the ajca  including the us manufacturing deduction  in our current estimate of the effective tax rate for of 
outlook in  the us economy continued to gain momentum from the expansion that began in late consumer confidence has been strong and has been buoyed by low interest rates  employment growth and improved us equity markets that reached their highest level in nearly three years 
industrial production  which grew at a rate of at the beginning of  slowed in the second half of the year  but still achieved a solid growth rate for the year 
industrial production is the economic metric that most positively correlates with our volume growth because it reflects activity in ppg s broad end use markets 
the commercial construction sector grew at a rate for the year but showed signs of further improvement during the second half of the year 
for the full year  north american sales of light vehicles were up slightly as were european automotive sales 
as the new year begins  most economists expect that the us economy will continue to perform well in though growth may perhaps be at a slower pace 
inflation is expected to remain relatively low  despite rising energy costs and raw material prices  because of increasing productivity 
interest rates should remain at relatively low levels 
the healthy us economy should help to support overall global economic growth in global competition combined with productivity improvements will keep overall inflation in check and sustain worldwide economic growth 
growth in the european economy will likely be adversely impacted by the strength of the euro  which at the end of was near its all time high against the us dollar 
however  the strengthening economy of eastern europe may be a mitigating factor 
the asian economies are expected to continue to record relatively high growth rates  especially in china 
this growth remains strong  yet tempered due to a variety of government efforts aimed at preventing the economy from overheating 
china s infrastructure growth is expected to continue to impact the overall global economy via increased demand for basic goods and commodities 
additionally  china and other low labor cost countries will continue to put downward pressure on worldwide pricing of consumer goods 
as was the case in  we expect china s expansion to benefit our coatings  fiber glass and optical businesses  while requiring our glass and commodity chemicals businesses to continue their ongoing focus on reducing costs 
in  we will remain committed to our ppg blueprint values of serving our customers  introducing new technologies and achieving operational excellence through our continuing focus on reducing costs 
the prospect of favorable global economic conditions this year lead us to expect continued sales growth in important cost issues in will continue to include pensions  other postretirement benefits  natural gas and raw materials 
while we have consistently focused on reducing our costs  we continue to be challenged by higher costs for employee benefits  particularly pensions and medical 
prior to  our pension income more than offset other postretirement benefit costs 
in  pension expense combined with other postretirement benefit costs were nearly million 
this cost increase translates to over per share in lower earnings in compared with this increase in costs results from a combination of the decline in the market value of the company s pension plans assets  due primarily to negative investment returns annual report and form k n ppg industries  inc 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis in the equity markets during  a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets  lower discount rate assumption and rising retiree medical costs  particularly for prescription drugs 
the current low interest rate environment has continued and  in fact  the discount rate at dec 
  was approximately basis points lower than at dec 
 this raises the present value of future benefit obligations and expense 
offsetting the negative impact of lower discount rates were the strong actual return on our us plan assets of over in and over in additionally  the benefit of the subsidy available under the medicare act reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and resulted in a reduction of our other postretirement benefit cost in of million 
this benefit is expected to be approximately million in based on current estimates  including the benefit of this subsidy  our pension and other postretirement benefit costs for are expected to rise only slightly from the level 
high natural gas costs in north america continue to be a drag on earnings 
changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments 
each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu million british thermal units would have a direct impact of approximately million to million on our annual operating costs 
it is difficult to predict future natural gas prices  which continue to be high and volatile 
in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices  we use a number of techniques  which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes  switching to alternative fuels and hedging 
we currently estimate our average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of will be approximately per mmbtu  including the impact of hedges we have in place on approximately one third of our expected first quarter natural gas consumption 
this estimate represents an increase of over our first quarter cost of natural gas 
in the second half of  we began to see increases in the prices for raw materials used in our coatings businesses  as a result of the industrial expansion  supply demand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs 
year over year coatings raw material costs will rise at least million in the first quarter of and are likely to continue to be higher for the remainder of we plan to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate supply sources  reformulating our products  improving our production processes and yields and raising our selling prices 
these same factors  along with high capacity utilization  resulted in tighter supplies of chlor alkali products 
this led to a sharp increase in ecu prices in the second half of which benefited our commodity chemicals business 
ecu prices in the fourth quarter were up versus the fourth quarter of we expect these tight supply demand conditions in the market to continue at least through the first half of our focus on our blueprint values has enabled us to continue along our track of strong cash generation  as evidenced by the billion in cash from operating activities over the time period 
we have continued to fund our portfolio of businesses and prudently manage capital spending while at the same time continuing our trend of increasing dividend payments to shareholders for consecutive years and reducing our debt by over billion over the past three years 
additionally  we repurchased million of ppg common stock in and have announced plans to repurchase up to million in ppg common stock by the end of we remain confident that ppg is well positioned to benefit from the expected worldwide economic growth in accounting standard adopted in effective jan

 accounting for stock based compensation  for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption and for previously issued stock options that were not vested as of jan 
 using the modified prospective transition method 
the adoption increased selling  general and administrative expense by million million  aftertax  or per share for the year ended dec 
 this impact reflects the fact that beginning in stock option grants under the ppg stock plan will vest three years after the date of grant 
previously  original grants of stock options under this plan vested after one year 
additionally  under the modified prospective transition method we recorded a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital equal to the deferred tax benefit that would have been recognized in had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value provisions of sfas no

the provisions of this statement are effective for costs incurred after dec 
 we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have on ppg  however we do not expect it to have a material effect on ppg s consolidated results of operations or financial position

critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item of this form k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and to accounting for pensions  other postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  environmental remediation  pending litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for more information on these matters  see note  working capital detail  note  income taxes and note  commitments and contingent liabilities under item of this form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  under item of this form k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments  evaluating market interest rate indices and using an outside advisor to determine the yield on a diversified portfolio of available high quality fixed income securities that matches our projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for is for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would increase net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately million and million  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
for  the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 
we expect to use the same assumption for a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million
