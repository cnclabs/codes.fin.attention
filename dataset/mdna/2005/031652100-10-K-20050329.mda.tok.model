company overview amkor is one of the world s largest subcontractors of semiconductor packaging and test services 
amkor pioneered the outsourcing of semiconductor packaging and test services in  and over the years has built a leading position by providing a broad portfolio of packaging and test technologies and services  maintaining a leading role in the design and development of new package and test technologies  cultivating long standing relationships with customers  including many of the world s leading semiconductor companies  developing expertise in high volume manufacturing  and providing a broadly diversified operational scope  with production capabilities in china  korea  japan  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and the us the semiconductors that we package and test for our customers ultimately become components in electronic systems used in communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive and military applications 
our customers include  among others  agilent technologies  inc  atmel corporation  ibm  infineon technologies ag  intel corporation  philips electronics nv  samsung  st microelectronics pte  sony semiconductor corporation  texas instruments inc and toshiba corporation 
the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive 
we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers  some of whom can use us as a source of overflow capacity 
packaging and test are integral parts of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
semiconductor manufacturing begins with silicon wafers and involves the fabrication of electronic circuitry into complex patterns  thus creating individual chips on the wafers 
the packaging process creates an electrical interconnect between the semiconductor chip and the system board 
in packaging  the fabricated semiconductor wafers are cut into individual chips which are attached to a substrate and then encased in a protective material to provide optimal electrical connectivity and thermal performance 
the packaged chips are then tested using sophisticated equipment to ensure that each packaged chip meets its design specifications 
increasingly  packages are custom designed for specific chips and specific end market applications 
we historically marketed the output of fabricated semiconductor wafers provided by a wafer fabrication foundry owned and operated by anam semiconductor  inc asi 
on february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
we have restated our historical results to reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
amkor was incorporated in in the state of delaware as the successor in interest to various entities initially founded in references in this annual report to amkor shall mean amkor and  as applicable  its predecessor entities 
our expectations regarding future business conditions our business is tied to market conditions in the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical 
based on industry estimates  from through  there were years when semiconductor industry growth  measured by revenue dollars  was or less and years when growth was or greater 
since  the semiconductor industry declined in   and the semiconductor industry declined an unprecedented in  experienced a growth in as compared to  experienced growth in as compared to and experienced growth in as compared to the historical trends in the semiconductor industry are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
in considering industry growth estimates  we look at a group of nine leading industry analysts 
these analysts have forecasted industry growth to range from negative to positive  with a median growth rate of 
these analysts have also forecasted industry growth to range from negative to positive  with a median growth rate of 
the strength of the semiconductor industry is dependent primarily upon the strength of the computer and communications systems markets as well as the strength of the worldwide economy 
in addition to the historical trend in the semiconductor industry as a whole  the trend towards increased outsourcing of packaging and test services in the semiconductor industry has been a primary factor for our historical growth in revenues 
we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future as we believe technological advances are driving our customers to outsource more of their packaging requirements 
our first calendar quarter is typically a seasonally down quarter for us  and we currently expect packaging and test revenue for the first quarter of to range from to lower than packaging and test revenues for the fourth quarter of we expect that first quarter of gross margin will range from to 
our profitability is dependent upon the utilization of our capacity  semiconductor package mix and the average selling price of our services 
because a substantial portion of our costs at our factories is fixed  relatively insignificant increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our profitability 
prices for packaging and test services have declined over time 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of price declines by successfully developing and marketing new packages with higher prices  such as advanced leadframe and laminate packages  by negotiating lower prices with our material vendors  and by driving engineering and technological changes in our packaging and test processes which resulted in reduced manufacturing costs 
we expect that average selling prices for our packaging and test services will continue to decline in the future 
if our semiconductor package mix does not shift to new technologies with higher prices or we cannot reduce the cost of our packaging and test services to offset a decline in average selling prices  our future operating results will suffer 
beginning in the second quarter of  we began to experience increases in substrate material costs as a result of supply shortages 
in the third quarter of  substrate material costs stabilized at the higher price levels set during the second quarter of we have significantly enhanced our supply base and do not foresee substrate material availability as an ongoing issue 
however  supply shortages may again occur in the future and in such an event  gross margins could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the average price of gold has been increasing over the past few years 
although we have been able to partially offset the effect of gold price increases through price adjustments to customers and changes in our product designs  gold prices may continue to increase 
to the extent that we are unable to offset these increases in the future  our gross margins could be negatively impacted 
average selling prices for declined approximately as compared to average selling prices in average selling prices for declined approximately as compared to average selling prices in results of continuing operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues gross profit operating income loss loss before income taxes  equity investment losses  minority interest and discontinued operations net loss from continuing operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase in net revenues for was principally attributed to an overall unit volume increase of 
this increase in volume was driven by a increase for advanced packages and a increase in our traditional packages 
partially offsetting the volume increases  average selling prices for declined approximately as compared to average selling prices in this decrease in overall average selling prices was driven by a decrease in average selling prices for advanced packages and a decrease in average selling prices for traditional packages 
revenue from our acquisitions refer to significant events our acquisitions below accounted for of our increase in net revenues for the twelve months ended december  gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in our cost of revenues consists principally of costs of materials  labor and depreciation 
because a substantial portion of our costs at our factories is fixed  relatively insignificant increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in from in the decline of is a result of average selling price erosion across our product lines  which decreased gross margin by approximately  increased labor and overhead expenses  which decreased gross margin by approximately  and a shift in product mix  which decreased gross margin by approximately 
principally offsetting these negative impacts on gross margin was the benefit of positive operating leverage associated with increased unit volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in during  we experienced increased litigation costs of million over the prior year related to our patent infringement and epoxy mold compound litigation matters 
the remaining increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million related to increased compensation costs and general business activity to support our overall business growth and increased compliance costs  million related to the operations of our acquisitions and an increase in executive termination benefits of million 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in our increase in our research and development expenses was primarily related to the establishment of a research and development center  during the three months ended march   located within our amkor iwate factory in japan and increased activities related to our leading edge technologies 
our research and development efforts support our customers needs for smaller packages and increased functionality 
we continue to invest our research and development resources to further the development of flip chip interconnection solutions  chip scale packages that are nearly the size of the semiconductor die  mems devices used in a variety of end markets including automotive  industrial and personal entertainment  our stacked chip packages that stack as many as three semiconductor dies in a single package  wafer level packaging  and system in package technology  that uses both advanced packaging and traditional surface mount techniques to enable the combination of technologies in a single chip 
special charges 
during  we recorded million of special charges for severance and other expenses related to corporate relocation activities 
during  we recorded special charges of million  net  related to a contract termination fee of million in order to terminate our commitment to purchase a tract of land adjacent to our amkor iwate facility and a gain of million related to the settlement of a pre existing contingency 
other income expense 
other expenses  net  decreased million  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the net decrease  or favorable change  was primarily the result of debt retirement costs decreasing million as compared to the prior year and gains from sale of asi shares increasing million over the prior year 
also contributing to this decrease was a million legal settlement gain related to our claims against a software vendor incurred during in addition  in we did not incur the following  non recurring charges that were incurred in a million non recurring loss related to our asi call options and million of other non recurring charges 
the above favorable changes of were partially offset by the following unfavorable changes increased foreign currency losses of million due to the depreciation of the us dollar against many of the asian currencies where we operate  increased interest expense of million and a non recurring gain from the prior year of million related to the sale of our investment in an intellectual property company 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of million in  compared to an income tax benefit of million in our tax provision includes taxes relating to our profitable foreign tax jurisdictions  a provision of million recorded in connection with new guidance issued by tax authorities relating to the taxation of our operations  and us alternative minimum tax for which we do not anticipate a future benefit 
the provision is partially offset by a non recurring million tax benefit as a result of a favorable ruling in a foreign jurisdiction 
in  we continued to record a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets generated 
we will resume the recognition of deferred tax assets when we return to sustained profitability in our various tax jurisdictions 
in  we recorded a tax provision of million related to our discontinued operations  for which we were able to record an offsetting tax benefit related to our continuing operations 
we also reduced tax accruals  during  by million related to tax periods no longer open 
these tax benefits were offset by taxes related to our profitable foreign tax jurisdictions 
in connection with recent tax law changes  during the fourth quarter we realigned our corporate tax structure and repatriated approximately million in earnings of foreign operations  which were offset by utilization of million of our us net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we have remaining us net operating losses available to be carried forward totaling million expiring between and additionally  we have non us net operating losses available to be carried forward totaling million that will begin to expire in the tax returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to changes upon examination 
during  the internal revenue service commenced an examination related to years and in february  we verbally agreed to a settlement in principle with the irs for these years 
as a component of the settlement  we agreed to make certain income adjustments to our us tax returns in the years through for local attribution of income resulting from significant intercompany transactions  including ownership and use of intellectual property  in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
these adjustments would effectively lower our us net operating loss carryforwards at december  by million 
this settlement agreement is not final until review and approval by the congressional joint committee on taxation  the timing of which is uncertain 
we believe that we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for the additional taxes and interest expense that will result from these adjustments 
our estimated tax liability is subject to change as examinations of specific tax years are completed in the respective jurisdictions 
we believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  nor do we expect that examinations to be completed in the near term would have a material favorable impact 
in addition  changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates in the future 
equity investment losses 
our earnings include our share of losses in our equity affiliates in of million  as compared to million in our equity investment losses are comprised primarily of our share of losses from our investment in asi during the period january  through march  on march   we divested million shares of asi which reduced our ownership percentage in asi to at that time  and we then ceased the equity method accounting for our investment in asi 
minority interest 
minority interest expense was million in  as compared to million in in january  we acquired the remaining ownership interest of amkor iwate from toshiba for million  eliminating the previous minority interest related to this company 
as of january  we own of amkor iwate 
in addition  in august we acquired approximately of the capital stock of unitive semiconductor taiwan corp  and accordingly  now account for the minority interest in consolidated statement of operations 
refer to our acquisitions below for further discussion related to these acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase in net revenues for  excluding the impact of amkor iwate  was principally attributed to an overall unit volume increase of 
this increase in volume was driven by a increase for advanced packages and an increase in our traditional packages 
partially offsetting the volume increases  average selling prices for declined as compared to average selling prices in our japanese joint venture  amkor iwate  provided packaging and test services principally to toshiba s iwate factory under a long term supply agreement on a cost plus basis during the term of the joint venture 
this joint venture ended in january accordingly  the revenues associated with this facility fluctuate proportionately with its costs 
the revenues of amkor iwate increased million in compared to due primarily to higher costs associated with a shift in product mix  and to a lesser extent  the weakening of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen 
prices for packaging and test services have declined over time 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of price declines by successfully developing and marketing new packages with higher prices  such as advanced leadframe and laminate packages  by negotiating lower prices with our material vendors  and by driving engineering and technological changes in our packaging and test processes which resulted in reduced manufacturing costs 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in our cost of revenues consists principally of costs of materials  labor and depreciation 
because a substantial portion of our costs at our factories is fixed  relatively insignificant increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our gross margin 
gross margins as a percentage of net revenues increased percentage points to in as compared to in principally as a result of the following events at our factories  excluding amkor iwate increased unit volumes contributed approximately percentage points to the increase in gross margin 
approximately percentage points of the increase in gross margin was due to a reduction in depreciation costs of million 
million of the reduced depreciation costs was attributable to the fixed asset impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of  and approximately million was the result of the change in estimated useful lives of certain packaging equipment beginning with the fourth quarter of the remaining decrease in depreciation costs is due to assets reaching fully depreciated status partially offset by an increase in depreciation costs related to capital expenditures 
material cost savings contributed approximately percentage points to the increase in gross margins 
the positive impacts on gross margins were partially offset by average selling price erosion across our product lines caused an estimated percentage points decline in gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly by million to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in during  we experienced a significant increase in our litigation costs as a result of the mold compound litigation matter 
legal fees associated with this mold compound litigation matter were million during  as opposed to million in the increase in legal costs during was offset by savings from our administrative overhead cost reduction initiatives which began in  including savings from certain facilities which were shutdown in research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in these costs was primarily attributable to our corporate cost reduction initiatives  which included closing our two us research and development facilities during the second and third quarters of and consolidating these activities within our existing asian based research and development facilities 
special charges 
during  we recorded million of special charges  as compared to million in during  a contract termination fee of million was paid in order to terminate our commitment to purchase a tract of land adjacent to our amkor iwate facility 
also during  we recorded a gain of million related to the settlement of a pre existing contingency 
during  we recorded million of special charges which are further discussed below under significant events special charges 
other income expense 
other expenses  net  increased million  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in other expenses during primarily resulted from debt retirement costs of million and losses of million related to our asi call options discussed further below under significant events 
these expenses were partially offset by a gain of million related to the sale of our investment in an intellectual property company  our decrease in interest expense of million  a gain of million related to the sale of million shares of common stock of asi and an increase in foreign currency gains  net  of million 
our million decrease in interest expense was primarily as a result our of debt refinancing and debt repurchase activity during provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in  as compared to an income tax provision of million in in  in light of our three years of cumulative losses  an unprecedented industry downturn and continued poor visibility of customer demand  we determined that a valuation allowance representing substantially all of our deferred tax assets was appropriate 
accordingly  in  there was only a modest tax benefit resulting from our losses from continuing operations primarily because we continue to record a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets generated 
further  we recorded a tax provision of million related to our discontinued operations  for which we were able to record an offsetting tax benefit related to our continuing operations 
we also reduced tax accruals  during  by million related to tax periods no longer open 
these tax benefits have been offset by taxes related to our profitable foreign tax jurisdictions 
equity investment losses 
our earnings include our share of losses in our equity affiliates in of million  as compared to million in in  our earnings included our share of losses in our equity affiliates  principally asi  in of million and impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in asi to asi s market value 
additionally during  we recorded a loss of million on the disposition of a portion of our interest in asi 
our equity investment losses are comprised primarily of our share of losses from our investment in asi during the period january  through march  on march   we divested million shares of asi which reduced our ownership percentage in asi to at that time  and we then ceased the equity method accounting for our investment in asi 
results of discontinued operations on february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
additionally  we obtained a release from texas instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to asi 
we restated our historical results to reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation 
in connection with the disposition of our wafer fabrication business  we recorded  in the first quarter of  million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer fabrication services operations in boise  idaho and lyon  france 
also in the first quarter of  we recognized a pre tax gain on the disposition of our wafer fabrication services business of million million  net of tax 
the carrying value of the sold net assets associated with the business as of february  was million 
significant events our historical relationship with asi historically  under a former supply agreement  we subcontracted for packaging and test services which were sourced from asi s factories in korea 
beginning in may with the completion of our acquisitions of asi s packaging and test facilities  we no longer depend upon asi for packaging or test services 
in connection with the acquisition of the facilities  we committed to making equity investments in asi and  as a result  accumulated a ownership interest in asi 
in addition  under a former wafer fabrication services supply agreement  we purchased the wafer output of asi s wafer fabrication facility 
as part of our strategy to sell our investment in asi and to divest our wafer fabrication services business  we entered into the following series of transactions beginning in the second half of in september  we sold million shares of asi common stock to dongbu group in exchange for korean won per share  the market value of asi common stock as traded on the korean stock exchange at the time we entered into the share sale agreement 
we received million in net cash proceeds and billion won approximately million based on the spot exchange rate on the closing date of interest bearing notes from dongbu corporation payable in two equal principal payments in september and february the dongbu group comprises dongbu corporation  dongbu fire insurance co  ltd 
and dongbu life insurance co  ltd  all of which are korean corporations and are collectively referred to herein as dongbu 
associated with this transaction  we recorded a million loss 
additionally  we divested one million shares of asi common stock in connection with the payment of certain advisory fees related to this transaction 
on september   we received billion won approximately million based on the spot exchange rate on the transaction date  consisting of the principal amount due under the notes from dongbu 
the remaining principal  or billion won approximately million based on the spot exchange rate on the transaction date  was received on february  in separate transactions designed to facilitate a future merger between asi and dongbu  i we acquired a interest in acqutek from asi for million  the market value of the shares as publicly traded in korea  ii we acquired the precision machine division pmd of anam instruments  a related party to amkor  for million  its fair value  and iii anam instruments  which had been partially owned by asi  utilized the proceeds from the sale of pmd to us to buy back all of the anam instruments shares owned by asi 
acqutek supplies materials to the semiconductor industry and is publicly traded in korea 
an entity controlled by the family of james kim  our chairman and chief executive officer  held a ownership interest in acqutek at the time of our acquisition of our interest in acqutek 
we have historically purchased and continue to purchase leadframes from acqutek 
on september   we sold our entire ownership interest in acqutek 
pmd supplies sophisticated die mold systems and tooling to the semiconductor industry and historically over of its sales were to amkor 
we determined the fair value of pmd based on projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
at the time of our acquisition of pmd  anam instruments was owned by asi and by a family member of james kim 
on february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi for million 
we negotiated the fair value of our wafer fabrication services business with asi and dongbu 
the parties calculated fair value based on an assessment of projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
we obtained a release from texas instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to asi 
each of the transactions with dongbu  asi and anam instruments are interrelated and it is possible that if each of the transactions were viewed on a stand alone basis without regard to the other transactions  we could have had different conclusions as to fair value 
it is likely that we would not have entered into the acqutek or pmd transactions absent the share sale to dongbu and the sale of the wafer fabrication services business to asi 
had these transactions not been interrelated  we may have utilized a different negotiation strategy for the investment in acqutek and the acquisition of pmd  which could have resulted in us reaching a different conclusion of the fair value of both of these transactions 
pursuant to the definitive agreements  amkor and dongbu agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause dongbu electronics and asi to be merged together as soon as practicable  amkor and dongbu agreed to cause asi to use the proceeds asi received from its sale of stock to dongbu to purchase shares in dongbu electronics and amkor and dongbu agreed to use their best efforts to provide releases and indemnifications to the chairman  directors and officers of asi  either past or incumbent  from any and all liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties at asi between january  and december  the last provision would provide a release and indemnification for james kim  our ceo and chairman  and members of his family 
we are not aware of any claims or other liabilities which these individuals would be released from or for which they would receive indemnification 
subsequent to the sale of a portion of our investment in asi to dongbu in  we were unable to identify another strategic buyer 
asi s common stock  which is listed on the korean stock exchange  is relatively thinly traded and subject to volatile swings in daily trading volumes 
in an effort to continue to monetize our investment in asi s common stock  we evaluated  in consultation with a financial institution  the most efficient method to divest a large block of shares into the market without destabilizing the share price of asi s common stock 
on march   we consummated a series of transactions proposed by a financial institution 
we irrevocably sold a block of million shares of asi common stock to the financial institution for approximately million  or per share 
we also entered into a nondeliverable call option with the financial institution for million  the fair value of the option at that date plus the transaction costs 
in may  we exercised the nondeliverable call option realizing million of cash proceeds 
accordingly  during we recorded a loss of million related to this nondeliverable call option 
on september   we sold an additional million shares of asi common stock to the same financial institution for approximately million based on the spot exchange rate as of the transaction date  or per share  and recorded an associated gain of million during we also entered into a nondeliverable call option with the financial institution for million  the fair value of the option at that date plus the transaction costs 
in december  we exercised the nondeliverable call option realizing million of cash proceeds 
accordingly  during we recorded a loss of million related to this nondeliverable call option 
in april  we sold million shares of asi common stock for approximately million  or per share  and recorded an associated gain of million 
as of december   we had reduced our ownership in asi to million shares  or approximately of asi s voting stock  with a carrying value of million  including an unrealized gain of million 
the march and september call options discussed above allowed us to continue to monetize our investment in asi at a fixed price with unlimited upside and limited downside economics 
in addition  it provided us with the economic benefits of selling shares through a dollar averaging sales program without incurring the transaction costs associated with multiple small quantity sales 
the call premiums provided the financial institution some downward protection if the market for asi s common stock destabilized as it sold its investment in asi s common stock into the market 
all ownership rights and privileges associated with the million shares of asi s common stock sold during were irrevocably transferred to the financial institution 
in no event could the financial institution have put the shares back to amkor nor was there a provision in the agreements for amkor to reacquire the shares 
our acquisitions in january  amkor iwate corporation commenced operations and acquired from toshiba a packaging and test facility located in the iwate prefecture in japan 
at that time  we owned of amkor iwate and toshiba owned the balance of the outstanding shares 
in january  we acquired the remaining ownership interest of amkor iwate from toshiba for million 
also in january  we paid approximately million to terminate our commitment to purchase a tract of land adjacent to the amkor iwate facility 
a million charge was recorded in special charges during the fourth quarter of related to this termination fee 
amkor iwate provides packaging and test services principally to toshiba s iwate factory under a long term supply agreement that provides for services that were performed on a cost plus basis through december and then at market based rates beginning january this long term supply agreement with toshiba s iwate factory terminates january in may  we acquired certain assembly and test assets from ibm and shanghai waigaoqiao free trade zone xin development co  ltd 
xin development co  ltd 
the acquired assets included a test operation located in singapore primarily test equipment and workforce  a  square foot building and associated year land use rights located in china  and other intangible assets 
the  square foot facility is classified as construction in process  and we currently do not anticipate facilitizing the building until these assets were acquired for the purposes of increasing our assembly and test capacity 
the purchase price was valued at approximately million  including million of short term notes payable net of a million discount 
the short term notes payable  and interest thereon of million  was paid during the fourth quarter of in august  we acquired approximately of the capital stock of unitive  inc unitive  based in north carolina  and approximately of the capital stock of unitive semiconductor taiwan corp 
ust  a taiwan based joint venture between unitive and various taiwanese investors 
in december  we acquired the remaining of unitive inc unitive and ust are providers of wafer level technologies and services for flip chip and wafer level packaging applications 
the total purchase price was comprised of million  which included cash consideration due at closing of million  million of direct acquisition costs and million or million based on the discounted value due one year after closing 
in addition  we assumed million of debt 
both transactions include provisions for contingent  performance based earn outs which could increase the value of the transactions 
with respect to unitive  the maximum earn out is million  although our current estimate of this earn out is zero 
with respect to ust  we currently estimate the value of the earn out will range from million to million 
the earn outs will be paid approximately one year after closing 
the unitive earn out may be paid in either cash or stock  at our option 
we also retain an option to acquire the remaining interest of approximately of ust for a maximum of million 
this option expires months after closing 
however  if ust meets certain production related goals prior to the expiration of the month call option period  at the option of the minority interest holders we would be required to purchase the remaining interest of approximately of ust for a maximum of million 
the results of unitive and ust operations are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on their dates of acquisition  august  and august   respectively 
our acquisitions in april  we acquired the semiconductor packaging business of citizen watch co  ltd 
located in the iwate prefecture in japan 
the business acquired included manufacturing equipment  over employees and intellectual property 
the purchase price included a million cash payment at closing 
we were required to make additional payments one year from closing for the amount of the deferred purchase price as well as contingent payments 
based on the resolution of the contingency as of january  the total amount of additional payments due in april was billion japanese yen 
in april  we made a payment of million japanese yen  or million based on the exchange rate on the date of the payment 
we are withholding payment of billion yen million based on the spot exchange rate at december  of this amount pending resolution of a controversy relating to the patents acquired in connection with the acquisition 
we recorded million of intangible assets for patent rights that are amortizable over years 
our results of operation were not significantly impacted by this acquisition 
special charges during  we recorded million of special charges 
special charges  in thousands  were comprised of impairment of long lived assets impairment of goodwill lease termination and other exit costs during  the semiconductor industry declined an unprecedented  which impacted the utilization rates of our packaging and test assets 
during the second quarter of  total packaging and test revenues grew over as compared to the first quarter of we experienced significant recovery in most of our company s packaging services 
however  our test services assets and several packaging services assets did not contribute significantly to the growth experienced during the second quarter of  remained at low utilization rates relative to our projections and were no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization levels 
in addition  as of june   we experienced a decline in our market capitalization as compared to march  these events triggered an impairment review in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
this review included a company wide evaluation of underutilized assets and a detailed update of our operating and cash flow projections 
based on our company wide evaluation of underutilized assets  we identified million of test and packaging assets to be disposed 
we recognized an million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed to their fair value less cost to sell 
fair value of the assets to be disposed was determined with the assistance of an appraisal firm and available information on the resale value of the equipment 
as of december   we have disposed of all of the identified test and packaging assets 
upon the completion of the process to identify the packaging and test net assets to be disposed  we reviewed our assets to be held and used for impairment 
based on the june  operating and cash flow projections  we determined that the carrying value of our test services assets and several packaging services assets being held and used  including intangible assets that we are amortizing  exceeded the anticipated cash flows attributable to those assets 
we grouped our long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for our company  the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is at the test reporting unit level and for our packaging services reporting unit at the package type level 
our test reporting unit and the outsourced integrated circuit test services industry were adversely impacted by excess capacity at the large integrated device manufacturers 
we expected that when the semiconductor industry recovered  the demand from integrated device manufacturers for outsourced test services would also recover 
however  that anticipated recovery failed to materialize in connection with the initial recovery we noted in the semiconductor industry during the first half of due to continued excess test capacity held by the large integrated device manufacturers 
we no longer expected that the demand for our test services on our existing technology platforms would return to the previously anticipated rates 
several of our package types based on more mature technologies and processes  including older leadframe and laminate package types  were adversely impacted by a technology shift to matrix and high density leadframes and the movement from multi layer laminate substrates to tape and chip arrays and stacked die packages 
we expected that when the semiconductor industry recovered there would still be sufficient demand for these more mature products 
however  that anticipated recovery failed to materialize in connection with the initial recovery we noted in the semiconductor industry during the first half of due to these technology shifts and the related significant excess capacity in the industry 
we no longer expected that the demand for these package types would return to the previously anticipated rates 
additionally  we experienced insufficient demand related to select investments in advanced package technologies principally as a result of alternative advanced package technologies which became industry standard 
as of june   we recognized a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of test and packaging assets to be held and used to their fair value 
the components of this charge were as follows carrying fair impairment value value charge in thousands test assets property  plant and equipment and acquired intangibles packaging assets property  plant and equipment an appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of the assets held for use 
the determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
depreciation expense was reduced by million during the six month period following the second quarter of  by million for the year and by million for the year the impact to depreciation expense diminishes quarterly as these assets reach the end of their respective useful lives 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  including when a significant adverse change in the business climate occurs and when long lived assets are tested for recoverability 
accordingly we retested goodwill for impairment as of june   and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as of june   we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
such impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the test services reporting unit to its carrying value 
an appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during and  we performed our annual review of goodwill for impairment 
based on our review  we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
during  we recorded million of charges related to the consolidation of our worldwide facilities to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs 
the charges were comprised of million to write off leasehold improvements and other long lived assets and million for lease termination and other exit costs 
our consolidation efforts included transferring the packaging operations at our k site in bucheon  south korea into our k factory in kwangju  south korea and closing the k facility  merging our factory operations in taiwan into a single location  and consolidating select us office locations and closing our san jose test facility 
the charges associated with the consolidation initiatives in korea  taiwan and the us were million  million and million  respectively 
we completed the closing of the k facility during the second quarter of and the other activities were substantially completed during we saved approximately million during as a result of these consolidation efforts 
change in depreciation we calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
we have historically estimated the useful lives of our machinery and equipment to be three to five years  with the substantial majority of our packaging assets having estimated useful lives of four years 
effective with the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated useful lives of certain of our packaging equipment from four years to seven years for depreciation purposes  which is in line with our historical usage and consistent with other companies in our industry 
we did not extend the useful lives of the packaging equipment associated with the second quarter impairment charge based on our expected use of that equipment and the associated cash flows 
this change reduced depreciation expense by approximately million in the fourth quarter of this change further reduced depreciation expense by approximately million in and million in our decision to change the estimated useful lives of such packaging equipment was based on the following historical experience  expected future cash flows  prevailing industry practice  consultations with an independent appraisal firm  and consultations with equipment manufacturers 
we believe that our principal competitors depreciate their packaging assets over periods of six to eight years 
quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited restated consolidated financial data  including as a percentage of our net revenues  for the last eight fiscal quarters ended december  our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
the results of the semiconductor packaging businesses acquired from unitive  inc and unitive semiconductor taiwan corporation in are included in the consolidated financial data from the date of the acquisitions 
we believe that we have included in the amounts stated below all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  for a fair presentation of our selected quarterly data 
you should read our selected quarterly data in conjunction with our restated consolidated financial statements and the related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
our net revenues  gross profit and operating income are generally lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year primarily due to the combined effect of holidays in the us and asia 
semiconductor companies in the us generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of december which results in a significant decrease in orders for packaging and test services during the first two weeks of january 
in addition  we typically close our factories in the philippines for holidays in january  and we close our factories in korea for holidays in february 
during the second quarter of  in connection with our redemption of our million senior notes due may we recorded charges of million related to the premium paid in the redemption  million for the associated unamortized deferred debt costs of million of other costs  or million in total  which is included in other expense  net 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain  in other expense  net  of million related to the sale of our investment in an intellectual property company  which is included in other expense  net 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a gain of million related to our sale of million shares of asi common stock  which is included in other expense  net 
the calculation of basic and diluted per share amounts for each quarter is based on the average shares outstanding for that period  consequently  the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted net income loss per share

 june  march  discontinued operations income from wafer fabrication services business  net of tax net income loss liquidity and capital resources our ongoing primary cash needs are for debt service  equipment purchases and working capital 
our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  was million  and we had million available under our million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the amount available under our senior secured revolving credit facility at december  was reduced by million related to outstanding letters of credit 
we believe that our existing cash balances  available credit lines  cash flow from operations and available equipment lease financing will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  debt service and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we have million and million of convertible subordinated notes due in and  respectively see debt instruments and related covenants below 
we are evaluating alternatives to repay or refinance these obligations 
in the event we decide to consummate additional business combinations  we may require additional cash and we cannot assure that additional financing will be available when we need it or  if available  that it will be available on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the terms of the senior notes  senior subordinated notes and senior secured credit facilities significantly reduce our ability to incur additional debt 
failure to obtain any such required additional financing could have a material adverse effect on us 
cash flows net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities from continuing operations and cash provided by discontinued operations for the three years ended december  were as follows year ended december  december  december  in thousands operating activities from continuing operations investing activities from continuing operations financing activities from continuing operations discontinued operations cash flows from continuing operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities increased million to million in  from in our cash flows from continuing operating activities increased as a result of our improved operating performance  primarily driven by revenue increases  partially offset by our increased needs for working capital 
the primary contributors to operating cash flows from continuing operations in were million of cash flows provided by continuing operations adjusted for non cash and non operating items  a decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily due to the timing of a japanese holiday occurring at the end of the prior year which then impeded cash collections  an increase in other long term liabilities of million primarily due to an increase in our korean severance liability and a million increase in accrued expenses 
these sources were primarily offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in inventory levels 
cash flows from continuing investing activities our cash flows used in continuing investing activities increased by million over the prior year  to million  primarily due to a million increase in capital expenditures from million in to million in in addition to cash used for capital expenditures  we paid million in cash during related to business acquisitions  as discussed below 
these cash outflows were offset by an increase of proceeds from our net sales of investments and sales of fixed assets of million 
the following business acquisitions  which are more fully discussed below under capital expenditures and acquisitions  occurred during in january  we acquired the remaining ownership interest of amkor iwate from toshiba for million 
we now own of amkor iwate 
in may  we acquired certain assembly and test assets from ibm and xin development co  ltd 
the purchase price was valued at approximately million  of which million of notes payable was subsequently paid in november  and accordingly  is included in financing cash flows 
in august  we acquired approximately of the capital stock of unitive  inc unitive  based in north carolina  and acquired approximately of the capital stock of unitive semiconductor taiwan corporation ust 
in december  we acquired the remaining of unitive 
the total purchase price was comprised of million  which included cash consideration due at closing of million  million of direct acquisition costs and million or million based on the discounted value due one year after closing 
in addition  we assumed million of debt and also now have contingent earn out provisions related to unitive and ust refer to further discussion below under capital expenditures and acquisitions 
during and  we completed the following transactions to continue the liquidation of our investment in asi on march   we irrevocably sold a block of million shares of asi common stock to a financial institution for approximately million 
we also entered into a nondeliverable call option for million 
in may  we exercised the nondeliverable call option realizing million of cash proceeds 
on september   we sold an additional million shares of asi common stock for approximately million 
we also entered into a nondeliverable call option for million 
in december  we exercised the nondeliverable call option realizing million of cash proceeds 
in april  we sold million shares of asi common stock for approximately million or million net of transaction costs  reducing our ownership in asi to approximately  or million shares 
cash flows from continuing financing activities our net cash inflows from continuing financing activities were million  an increase of million  as compared to million of outflows for during  significant sources of cash from financing activities were as follows in march  we received million of net proceeds from the sale of senior notes due  and in october  we received million of net proceeds from entering into a new million term loan credit facility due cash received from financing activities during was offset by the following uses of cash in march  we repaid our million senior secured term loan due in with the proceeds from the sale of our million of senior notes due  and in november  we paid notes payable of million related to our business acquisition from ibm and xin development co  ltd 
we engaged in these significant financing activities to enhance our financial flexibility 
these transactions and the related financial instruments are discussed in greater detail below 
debt instruments following is a summary of short term borrowings and long term debt december  in thousands senior secured credit facilities term loan  libor plus due january term loan  libor plus due october million revolving line of credit  libor plus due june senior notes due february senior notes due may senior notes due march  net of unamortized discount of million senior subordinated notes due may convertible subordinated notes due june  convertible at per share convertible subordinated notes due march  convertible at per share notes payable  net of unamortized discount of million other debt less short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt we now have  and for the foreseeable future will continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our debt  with such payments principally for interest 
for the year ended  interest expense payable in cash was million 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
significant financing activities in march  we sold million of senior notes due march the notes were priced at of the million face value  yielding an effective interest rate of 
we sold these notes to qualified institutional investors  used the net proceeds of the issuance to satisfy in full our outstanding term loan due of million and used the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the notes have a coupon rate of annually and interest payments are due semi annually 
in connection with the offering of these notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers 
the registration rights agreement entitled the purchasers  within days from the original issuance  to exchange their notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms as the original notes 
we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the exchange of the notes  and the exchange was completed in july in june  we entered into a new million senior secured revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility  which is available through june  replaced our prior million secured revolving line of credit  which had been scheduled to mature in october at december   there was million available under this facility 
in october  we entered into a new million term loan credit facility with a group of institutional lenders 
the term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points and matures in october the net proceeds of million from the term loan are available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in november  we paid million of notes payable related to our acquisition from ibm and xin development co  ltd 
capital expenditures and contractual obligations we have estimated first quarter capital expenditures of million and we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between million and million 
ultimately  the amount of our capital expenditures will depend on several factors including  among others  the performance of our business  the need for additional capacity to service anticipated customer demand and the availability of suitable financing 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payment due by year ending december  after total in thousands total debt  including capital leases purchase obligations operating lease obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations includes million of capital related purchase obligations 
our other noncurrent liabilities as of december  were million 
these other noncurrent liabilities included million related to pension and severance obligations  which are not included in the above chart due to the lack of contractual certainty as to the timing of payment 
included in accrued expenses at december   and not included above  is the payment withheld from citizen watch co  ltd 
of billion yen million based on the spot exchange rate at december  
refer to discussion under our acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or other off balance sheet arrangements as of december  other contingencies we refer you to item legal proceedings for a discussion of our contingencies related to our mold compound litigation  patent related litigation and other litigation matters 
we are currently a party to these various legal proceedings 
while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our net results in the period in which the ruling occurs 
the estimate of the potential impact from the legal proceedings  discussed under item  on our financial position or overall results of operations could change in the future 
in addition  on october   we announced that the securities and exchange commission sec is conducting an informal inquiry into trading in the securities of amkor technology  inc we believe that the inquiry relates to transactions in our securities by certain individuals  which may include certain insiders  during in connection with the informal inquiry  we have received requests from the sec to voluntarily produce documents and other relevant information concerning these matters  and we are cooperating with these requests 
the sec has advised us that the inquiry should not be construed as either an indication by the sec that any violations of law have occurred  or as an adverse reflection upon any person  entity or security 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
a summary of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements appears in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and risk of loss 
we recognized revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which supersedes sab sab requires that four criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee if fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenues from packaging semiconductors and performing test services are recognized upon completion of the services and shipment 
we do not take ownership of customer supplied semiconductor wafers 
title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at all times 
accordingly  the cost of the customer supplied materials is not included in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the sales of our wafer fabrication services business on february   we recorded wafer fabrication services revenues upon shipment of completed wafers 
provision for income taxes 
we operate in and file income tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities 
the tax returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to changes upon examination 
we believe that we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for the probable additional taxes and related interest expense that may ultimately result from examinations related to our transfer pricing and local attribution of income resulting from significant intercompany transactions  including ownership and use of intellectual property  in various us and us jurisdictions 
our estimated tax liability is subject to change as examinations of specific tax years are completed in the respective jurisdictions 
we believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates in the future 
additionally  we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
in  in light of our three years of cumulative losses  an unprecedented industry downturn and continued poor visibility of customer demand  we determined that a valuation allowance representing substantially all of our deferred tax assets was appropriate 
we will resume the recognition of deferred tax assets when we return to sustained profitability in the related tax jurisdictions 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets which includes property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset  excluding goodwill  is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
due to the existence of certain of the aforementioned indicators of impairment  we conducted a review in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  during the second quarter of as a result of this analysis  we identified million of packaging and test fixed assets to be disposed and recognized an million impairment charge to reduce the carrying values to their fair values less costs to sell 
in addition  we recognized a million impairment charge to reduce test and certain packaging assets that were to be held and used to their fair values based on projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased amortization of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill as of january  and then on an annual basis or between annual tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in the business climate and testing for recoverability of long lived assets 
since we tested our long lived assets for recoverability during the second quarter of  we tested goodwill for impairment  and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as a result  we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge based on projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
our depreciation accounting policy requires estimation of the useful lives of the assets to be depreciated as well as adoption of a method of depreciation 
we have historically calculated depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
we have historically estimated the useful lives of our machinery and equipment to be three to five years  with the substantial majority of our packaging assets having estimated useful lives of four years 
effective with the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated useful lives of certain of our packaging equipment from four years to seven years for depreciation purposes  which is in line with our historical usage and consistent with other companies in our industry 
we did not extend the useful lives of the packaging equipment associated with the second quarter impairment charge based on our expected use of that equipment and the associated cash flows 
this change reduced depreciation expense by million during the six month period following the second quarter of  by million for the year and by for the year our decision to change the estimated useful lives of such packaging equipment was based on the following historical experience  expected future cash flows  prevailing industry practice  consultations with an independent appraisal firm  and consultations with equipment manufacturers 
we believe that our principal competitors depreciate their packaging assets over periods of six to eight years 
the change of the estimated useful lives is considered a change in estimate and was accounted for prospectively beginning with the fourth quarter of legal contingencies 
we are subject to certain legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome related to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
our determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue  often with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
we record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
regarding our epoxy mold compound litigation matter  claims against us may run in excess of million 
we have concluded that a loss is not probable  and are currently unable to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result in the event of an unfavorable outcome of this pending litigation 
accordingly  we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies 
while we have incurred significant legal expenses in defense of this matter during and  we have been unable to reasonably estimate such costs in advance  and accordingly  we have expensed all legal costs in the period such services are provided 
our assessment of required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
the present legislative and litigation environment is substantially uncertain  and it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of our pending litigation 
we believe  and have been so advised by outside counsel handling these cases  that we have meritorious defenses to our litigation 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended 
evaluation of equity investments 
we evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value that are considered other than temporary 
in the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other than temporary  a charge to earnings is recorded for the unrealized loss 
the stock prices of semiconductor companies stocks  including asi and its competitors  have experienced significant volatility during the past several years 
during  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in asi to asi s market value 
valuation of inventory 
we order raw materials based on customers forecasted demand 
if our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendors require that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand  we will experience a build up in raw material inventory 
we will either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in production 
however  we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or be able to use the inventory in production and accordingly if we believe that it is probable that we will not be able to recover such costs we adjust our reserve estimate 
additionally  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based on forecasted demand we receive from our customers 
when a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production it is written off and disposed 
market risk sensitivity we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in interest rates 
our use of derivatives instruments  including forward exchange contracts  has been insignificant throughout and  and it is expected that our use of derivative instruments will continue to be minimal 
foreign currency risks our primary exposures to foreign currency fluctuations are associated with transactions and related assets and liabilities denominated in philippine pesos  korean won  japanese yen  and taiwanese dollar and chinese renminbi 
the objective in managing these foreign currency exposures is to minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and financial instruments denominated in those currencies 
our foreign currency financial instruments primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  investments  deferred taxes  trade payables and accrued expenses 
for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net asset position  an increase in the exchange rate would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net liability position  a decrease in the exchange rate would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
based on our portfolio of foreign currency based financial instruments at december  and  a change in the foreign currency to us dollar spot exchange rate would result in the following foreign currency risk as of december  chart of foreign currency risk philippine korea taiwanese japanese chinese peso won dollar yen renminbi in thousands increase in foreign exchange rate decrease in foreign exchange rate in addition  at december  we had other foreign currency denominated liabilities  including denominations of the euro  singapore dollar and swiss franc  whereby a decrease in the related exchange rates would result in an aggregate million of additional foreign currency risk 
as of december  chart of foreign currency risk philippine korea taiwanese japanese chinese peso won dollar yen renminbi in thousands increase in foreign exchange rate decrease in foreign exchange rate interest rate risks we have interest rate risk with respect to our long term debt 
as of december   we had a total of  million of debt of which was fixed rate debt and was variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt principally consists of short term borrowings and our secured million secured term loan  as well as our million revolving line of credit  of which million was available at december  as a result of letters of credit issued against this facility 
the fixed rate debt consisted of senior notes  senior subordinated notes  convertible subordinated notes and foreign debt 
as of december   we had a total of  million of debt of which was fixed rate debt and was variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on our fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the instrument but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instrument 
the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is also impacted by the market price of our common stock 
the table below presents the interest rates  maturities and fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december  year ending december  fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate equity price risks our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due and convertible subordinated notes due are convertible into common stock at per share and per share  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million of our convertible notes due and million of our convertible notes due we currently intend to repay our remaining convertible subordinated notes upon maturity  unless converted or refinanced 
if investors were to decide to convert their notes to common stock  our future earnings would benefit from a reduction in interest expense and our common stock outstanding would be increased 
if we paid a premium to induce such conversion  our earnings could include an additional charge 
further  the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future 
risk factors that may affect future operating performance the following section discloses the known material risks facing amkor 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
we cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur 
if they do  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this report contains forward looking statements regarding our expected performance that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below 
dependence on the highly cyclical semiconductor and electronic products industries we operate in volatile industries  and industry downturns harm our performance 
our business is tied to market conditions in the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical 
because our business is  and will continue to be  dependent on the requirements of semiconductor companies for subcontracted packaging and test services  any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices  such as the personal computer and telecommunication devices industries  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are currently experiencing a downturn in the semiconductor industry  which has negatively impacted our revenues  margins and net loss 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated customer orders  which are difficult to estimate due to the industry downturn 
our customers aggregate forecasts have weakened considerably during in connection with a greater level of uncertainty regarding end market demand 
this trend is materially hindering our visibility into revenue  the mix of that revenue  capacity utilization and the pricing environment 
in addition  our fixed operating costs and excess capacity have increased in part as a result of our efforts to expand our capacity through acquisitions  including the acquisition of certain operations and assets in shanghai  china and singapore from ibm and xin development co  ltd 
in may  and the acquisition of capital stock of unitive  inc and unitive semiconductor taiwan corporation in august we cannot predict if and when industry conditions will improve 
if industry conditions do not improve  we could sustain significant losses  which could materially impact our business including our liquidity 
fluctuations in operating results our results have varied and may vary significantly as a result of factors that we cannot control 
many factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and operating results  or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results 
our profitability is dependent upon the utilization of our capacity  semiconductor package mix  the average selling price of our services and our ability to control our costs including labor  material  overhead and financing costs 
our operating results have varied significantly from period to period 
during the three year period ended december   our revenues  gross margins and operating income have fluctuated significantly as a result of the following factors over which we have little or no control and which we expect to continue to impact our business fluctuation in demand for semiconductors and conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in our capacity utilization  declines in average selling prices  changes in the mix of semiconductor packages  absence of backlog and the short term nature of our customers commitments and the impact of these factors on the timing and volume of orders relative to our production capacity  changes in costs  availability and delivery times of raw materials and components  changes in labor costs to perform our services  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  changes in effective tax rates  high leverage and restrictive covenants  international events that impact our operations and environmental events such as earthquakes  and difficulties integrating acquisitions and our ability to attract qualified employees to support our geographic expansion 
we have historically been unable to accurately predict the impact of these factors upon our results for a particular period 
these factors  as well as the factors set forth below which have not significantly impacted our recent historical results  may impair our future business operations and may materially and adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and operating results  or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results the availability and cost of financing for expansion  loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders  warranty and product liability claims  intellectual property transactions and disputes  and fluctuations in our manufacturing yields 
declining average selling prices the semiconductor industry places downward pressure on the prices of our products 
prices for packaging and test services have declined over time 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of price declines by successfully developing and marketing new packages with higher prices  such as advanced leadframe and laminate packages  by negotiating lower prices with our material vendors  and by driving engineering and technological changes in our packaging and test processes which resulted in reduced manufacturing costs 
during  as compared to  the decline in average selling prices eroded margins by 
we expect that average selling prices for our packaging and test services will continue to decline in the future 
if our semiconductor package mix does not shift to new technologies with higher prices or we cannot reduce the cost of our packaging and test services to offset a decline in average selling prices  our future operating results will suffer 
high leverage and restrictive covenants our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes 
substantial leverage 
we now have  and for the foreseeable future will continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt balance was  million 
in addition  despite current debt levels  the terms of the indentures governing our indebtedness do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring substantially more debt 
if new debt is added to our consolidated debt level  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
covenants in the agreements governing our existing debt  and debt we may incur in the future  may materially restrict our operations  including our ability to incur debt  pay dividends  make certain investments and payments  and encumber or dispose of assets 
in addition  financial covenants contained in agreements relating to our existing and future debt could lead to a default in the event our results of operations do not meet our plans and we are unable to amend such financial covenants prior to default 
a default under one debt instrument may also trigger cross defaults under our other debt instruments 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our debt  limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage to any of our competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
ability to service debt and fund other liquidity needs 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs  and if we fail to do so  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  was million 
of our total debt balance as of december  of  million  million represented short term borrowings and the current portion of long term debt 
we have million and million of debt due in and  respectively see debt instruments and related covenants 
we are evaluating alternatives to repay or refinance these specific obligations 
overall  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
absence of backlog the recent decrease in customer demand has adversely affected our revenues 
our packaging and test business does not typically operate with any material backlog 
our quarterly net revenues from packaging and test are substantially dependent upon our customers demand in that quarter 
none of our customers have committed to purchase any significant amount of packaging or test services or to provide us with binding forecasts of demand for packaging and test services for any future period 
in addition  our customers often reduce  cancel or delay their purchases of packaging and test services 
recently  our customers forecasts have declined and our customers have provided lower than expected support for these forecasts  which has led to a decrease in our revenues and an increase in raw materials inventory 
because a large portion of our costs is fixed and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenues  we have been unable to adjust costs in a timely manner to compensate for the revenue shortfall  which has adversely affected our margins and net loss 
if customer demand does not increase  our business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with international operations we depend on our factories and operations in china  japan  korea  the philippines  singapore and taiwan 
many of our customers and vendors operations are also located outside of the us we provide packaging and test services through our factories and other operations located in the china  japan  korea  the philippines  singapore and taiwan 
moreover  many of our customers and vendors operations are located outside the us the following are some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally regulatory limitations imposed by foreign governments  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  military and terrorist risks  disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or government agencies  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 
difficulties integrating acquisitions we face challenges as we integrate new and diverse operations and try to attract qualified employees to support our expansion 
as a result of our geographic expansion and our business strategy to evaluate strategic acquisitions  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  growth in the scope and complexity of our operations 
for example  each business we have acquired had  at the time of acquisition  multiple systems for managing its own manufacturing  sales  inventory and other operations 
migrating these businesses to our systems typically is a slow  expensive process requiring us to divert significant amounts of resources from multiple aspects of our operations 
this growth has strained our managerial  financial  manufacturing and other resources 
future acquisitions and expansions may result in inefficiencies as we integrate new operations and manage geographically diverse operations 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management and technical personnel  any of whom would be difficult to replace 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and our business could be adversely affected by the loss of the services of any of our existing key personnel 
additionally  as part of our ongoing strategic planning  we evaluate our management team and engage in long term succession planning in order to ensure orderly replacement of key personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or in hiring and properly training sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and in effectively managing our growth 
our inability to attract  retain  motivate and train qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
dependence on materials and equipment suppliers our business may suffer if the cost  quality or supply of materials or equipment changes adversely 
we obtain from various vendors the materials and equipment required for the packaging and test services performed by our factories 
we source most of our materials  including critical materials such as leadframes  laminate substrates and gold wire  from a limited group of suppliers  all of which we may terminate at our option with days notice 
furthermore  we purchase the majority of our materials on a purchase order basis 
from time to time  we enter into supply agreements  generally up to one year in duration  to guarantee supply to meet projected demand 
such agreements may be terminated at the option of either party with days written notice 
our business may be harmed if we cannot obtain materials and other supplies from our vendors in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities  in acceptable quality or at competitive prices 
the average price of gold has been increasing over the past few years 
although we have been able to partially offset the effect of gold price increases through price adjustments to customers and changes in our product designs  gold prices may continue to increase 
to the extent that we are unable to offset these increases in the future  our gross margins could be negatively impacted 
capital expenditures we believe we need to make substantial capital expenditures  which may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our business requires us to incur significant capital expenditures in order to address what we believe is an overall trend in outsourcing of assembly and test 
our capital expenditures for the year ended were million 
we have estimated first quarter capital expenditures of million and we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between million and million 
ultimately  the amount of our capital expenditures will depend on several factors including  among others  the performance of our business  the need for additional capacity to service anticipated customer demand and the availability of suitable financing 
our capital expenditure requirements may strain our cash and short term asset balances  and we expect that the depreciation expenses and  to a lesser extent  factory operating expenses associated with our capital expenditures to increase production capacity  will put downward pressure on our near term gross margin 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover these expenditures with future revenue 
increased litigation incident to our business our business may suffer as a result of our involvement in various lawsuits 
we are currently a party to various legal proceedings  including those described in item 
legal proceedings in this annual report on form k 
as more fully described therein  recently we have become party to an increased number of litigation matters relative to our historic levels 
much of our recent increase in litigation relates to an allegedly defective epoxy compound  formerly used in some of our products  which is alleged to be responsible for certain semiconductor chip failures 
while we have filed cross claims for indemnification against sumitomo bakelite co  ltd  the manufacturer of the allegedly defective epoxy mold compound  should the epoxy mold compound be found to be defective  we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover any amount from sumitomo bakelite co  ltd 
if we are held liable in these matters  or that any adverse result would not have a material impact upon us 
moreover  other customers of ours have made inquiries about the epoxy mold compound  which was widely used in the semiconductor industry  and no assurance can be given that claims similar to these will not be made against us by other customers in the future 
while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any or all of the various legal proceedings  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period in which the ruling occurs 
the estimate of the potential impact from these legal proceedings on our financial position or results of operations could change in the future 
rapid technological change our business will suffer if we cannot keep up with technological advances in our industry 
the complexity and breadth of semiconductor packaging and test services are rapidly changing 
as a result  we expect that we will need to offer more advanced package designs in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer requirements 
our success depends upon our ability to develop and implement new manufacturing processes and package design technologies 
the need to develop and maintain advanced packaging capabilities and equipment could require significant research and development and capital expenditures in future years 
in addition  converting to new package designs or process methodologies could result in delays in producing new package types  which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer orders 
technological advances also typically lead to rapid and significant price erosion and may make our existing products less competitive or our existing inventories obsolete 
if we cannot achieve advances in package design or obtain access to advanced package designs developed by others  our business could suffer 
competition we compete against established competitors in the packaging and test business 
the subcontracted semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive 
we face substantial competition from established packaging and test service providers primarily located in asia  including companies with significant manufacturing capacity  financial resources  research and development operations  marketing and other capabilities 
these companies also have established relationships with many large semiconductor companies that are our current or potential customers 
on a larger scale  we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers 
environmental regulations future environmental regulations could place additional burdens on our manufacturing operations 
the semiconductor packaging process uses chemicals and gases and generates byproducts that are subject to extensive governmental regulations 
for example  at our foreign manufacturing facilities  we produce liquid waste when silicon wafers are diced into chips with the aid of diamond saws  then cooled with running water 
federal  state and local regulations in the united states  as well as international environmental regulations  impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals used in our manufacturing processes and on the factories we occupy 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 
in the future  applicable land use and environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  subject us to liability or cause us to curtail our operations 
protection of intellectual property we may become involved in intellectual property litigation 
we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by acquiring intellectual property protection and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents  copyrights  trade secrets and trademarks 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad 
we expect to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies  but we cannot assure you that we will receive patents from pending or future applications 
in addition  any patents we obtain may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us 
we may need to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation  which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if any third party makes an enforceable infringement claim against us  we could be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use  import and sale of infringing products  pay substantial damages  develop non infringing technologies  or acquire licenses to the technology we had allegedly infringed 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or if we are subjected to litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters  our business could suffer 
continued control by existing stockholders mr
