item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing central parking s sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand its operations by developing and maintaining relationships with major real estate developers and asset managers  business and government leaders  and other clients 
central parking encourages its managers to pursue new opportunities at the local level while selectively targeting key clients and projects at a national level 
local at the local level  central parking s sales and marketing efforts are decentralized and directed towards identifying new expansion opportunities within a particular city or region 
managers are trained to develop the business contacts necessary to generate new opportunities and monitor their local markets for take away and outsourcing opportunities 
central parking provides its managers with a significant degree of autonomy in order to encourage prompt and effective responses to local market demands  which is complemented by management support and marketing training through central parking s corporate offices 
by developing business contacts locally  central parking s managers often get the opportunity to bid on projects when asset managers and property owners are dissatisfied with other operators and also learn in advance of possible new projects 
national at the national level  central parking s marketing efforts are undertaken primarily by upper level management  which targets developers  governmental entities  the hospitality industry  mixed use projects  and medical facilities 
these efforts are directed at 
table of contents operations that generally have national name recognition  substantial demand for parking related services  and the potential for nationwide growth 
for example  central parking s current clients include  among other national real estate companies and hotel chains  millennium partners  faison associates  shorenstein  may department stores  crescent real estate  trizec office properties  jones lang lasalle  westin hotels  ritz carlton hotels and hyatt hotels 
management believes that providing high quality  efficient services to such companies can lead to additional opportunities as those clients expand their operations 
management believes outsourcing by parking facility owners will continue to be a source for additional facilities  and management believes the company s global presence  experience and reputation with large real estate asset managers give it a competitive advantage in this area 
international central parking s international operations began in the early s with the formation of an international division 
the company generally has entered foreign markets either through consulting projects or by forming joint ventures with established local entities 
consulting projects allow central parking to establish a presence and evaluate the prospects for growth in a given market without investing a significant amount of capital 
likewise  forming joint ventures with local partners allows central parking to enter new foreign markets with reduced operating and investment risks 
operations in london began in with a single consulting agreement and  as of september   had grown to locations in the united kingdom including four airports  eight rail operating companies and parking meter enforcement and ticketing services for thirteen local governments that have privatized these services 
central parking began expansion into mexico in july by forming a joint venture with g 
accion  formerly fondo opcion  an established mexican developer  and as of september   operated facilities in mexico 
in september  the company entered into a letter of intent to sell its interest in its joint venture company in mexico to its partner 
the letter of intent is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed 
as of september   central parking also operated facilities in canada  facilities in spain  in poland  in chile  in venezuela  in colombia  in peru  in switzerland  in the republic of ireland  and in greece 
the company also operates on street parking services in the united kingdom  germany and the republic of ireland 
in  central parking acquired a equity interest in a joint venture  which operated facilities in germany as of september  to manage its international expansion efforts  the company has allocated responsibilities for international operations to the president of international operations 
operating arrangements central parking operates parking facilities under three general types of arrangements management contracts  leases  and fee ownership 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the number of managed  leased  or owned facilities as of the specified dates september  managed leased owned total see item properties for certain information regarding the company s managed  leased and owned facilities 
the general terms and benefits of these types of arrangements are discussed below 
financial information regarding these types of arrangements is set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management contracts management contract revenues consist of management fees both fixed and performance based and fees for ancillary services such as insurance  accounting  benefits administration  equipment leasing  and consulting 
the cost of management contracts includes insurance premiums and claims and other indirect overhead 
the company s responsibilities under a management contract as a facility manager generally include hiring  training  and staffing parking personnel  and providing collections  accounting  record keeping and insurance 
most management contracts provide that the company is reimbursed for out of pocket expenses 
central parking is not responsible under most of its management contracts for structural  mechanical  or electrical maintenance or repairs  or for providing security or guard services or for paying property taxes 
in general  management contracts are for terms of one to three years and are renewable for successive one year terms  but are typically cancelable by the property owner on days notice 
with respect to insurance  the company s clients have the option of obtaining liability insurance on their own or having central parking provide insurance as part of the services provided under the management contract 
because of the company s size and claims experience  management believes it can purchase such insurance at lower rates than the company s clients can generally obtain on their own 

table of contents leases the company s leases generally require the payment of a fixed amount of rent  regardless of the amount of revenues or profitability generated by the parking facility 
in addition  many leases also require the payment of a percentage of gross revenues above specified threshold levels 
in general  leased facilities require a longer commitment  a larger capital investment for the company  and represent a greater risk than managed facilities due to the relatively fixed nature of expenses 
however  leased facilities often provide a greater opportunity for long term growth in revenues and profits 
the cost of parking includes rent  payroll and related benefits  depreciation  maintenance  insurance  and general operating expenses 
under its leases  the company is typically responsible for all facets of the parking operations  including pricing  utilities  and routine maintenance 
in short to medium term leases  the company is generally not responsible for structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs  or property taxes 
however  the company does often have these responsibilities in longer term leases 
lease arrangements are typically for terms of three to twenty years  and generally provide for increases in base rent that are either pre determined and recognized on a straight line basis or have contingent payments based on changes in indices  such as the consumer price index  and are recognized when incurred 
fee ownership ownership of parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  typically requires a larger capital investment and greater risk than managed or leased facilities  but provides maximum control over the operation of the parking facility and the greatest profit potential of the three types of operating arrangements 
all owned facility revenues flow directly to the company  and the company has the potential to realize benefits of appreciation in the value of the underlying real estate if the property is sold 
the ownership of a parking facility brings the company complete responsibility for all aspects of the property  including all structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs and property taxes 
joint ventures the company historically has sought joint venture partners who are established local or regional real estate developers 
joint ventures typically involve a interest in a development where the parking facility is a part of a larger multi use project  allowing the company s joint venture partners to benefit from a capital infusion to the project 
joint ventures offer the revenue growth potential of owned lots with lower capital requirements 
the company has interests in joint ventures that own or operate parking facilities located in the united states as well as several other countries 
dbe partnerships central parking is a party to a number of disadvantaged business enterprise partnerships 
these are generally partnerships formed by central parking and a disadvantaged business person to manage a facility 
central parking generally owns to of the partnership interests in each partnership and typically receives management fees before partnership distributions are made to the partners 
competition the parking industry is fragmented and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry 
the company competes with a variety of other companies to manage  lease and own parking facilities  and faces competition for customers and employees to operate parking facilities 
although there are relatively few large  national parking companies that compete with the company  numerous companies  including real estate developers  hotel and property management companies  and national financial services companies either compete currently or have the potential to compete with parking companies 
municipalities and other governmental entities also operate parking facilities that compete with central parking 
in addition  the company faces competition from numerous regional and local parking companies and from owner operators of facilities who are potential clients for the company s management services 
construction of new parking facilities near the company s existing facilities increases the competition for customers and employees and can adversely affect the company s business 
management believes that it competes for management clients based on a variety of factors  including fees charged for services  ability to generate revenues and control expenses for clients  accurate and timely reporting of operational results  quality of customer service  and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes 
factors that affect the company s ability to compete for leased and owned locations include the ability to make capital investments  pre paid rent payments and other financial commitments  long term financial stability  and the ability to generate revenues and control expenses 
the company competes for parking customers based primarily on rates charged for parking  convenience location of the facility  and quality of customer service 
factors affecting the company s ability to compete for employees include wages  benefits and working conditions 
seasonality the company s business is subject to a modest amount of seasonality 
historically  the company s results have been higher during the quarters that end on december and june the company attributes the relative lower results of the quarters that end on march and september to  among other factors  winter weather and summer vacations 
there can be no assurance that this 
table of contents trend will continue in future years 
for further discussion of this issue see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
insurance the company purchases comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur at parking facilities it owns  leases or manages 
the primary amount of such coverage is million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per facility 
in addition  the company purchases umbrella excess liability coverage 
the company s various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to  that must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the company for costs and liabilities relating to covered claims 
the company purchases a worker s compensation policy with a per claim deductible of  the company utilizes a third party administrator to process and pay filed worker s compensation claims 
the company also provides health insurance for many of its employees and purchases a stop loss policy with a deductible of  per claim 
as a result  the company is  in effect  self insured for all claims up to the deductible levels 
because of the size of the operations covered and its claims experience  the company purchases liability insurance policies at prices that management believes represent a discount to the prices that would typically be charged to parking facility owners on a stand alone basis 
pursuant to its management contracts  the company charges its management clients for insurance at rates it believes are competitive 
in each case  the company s management clients have the option of purchasing their own policies  provided the company is named as an additional insured 
a reduction in the number of clients that purchase insurance through the company could have a material adverse effect on the operating earnings of the company 
in addition  a material increase in insurance costs due to an increase in the number of claims  higher claims costs or higher premiums paid by the company could have a material adverse effect on the operating earnings of the company 
in this regard  the company has experienced a substantial increase in the premiums it pays for insurance in recent years and the company has experienced a significant increase in claims costs  including liability  group health  and worker s compensation 
these increased costs have adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company has been able to recover a portion of these increased costs through cost sharing programs  however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to fully recover or reduce these increased costs 
regulation the company s business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  and in some cases  municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities 
the facilities in new york city are  for example  subject to extensive governmental restrictions concerning numbers of cars  pricing  structural integrity and certain prohibited practices 
many cities impose a tax or surcharge on parking services  which generally range from to of revenues collected 
several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage 
these types of laws have adversely affected the company s revenues and could continue to do so in the future 
an example was the restrictions imposed by the city of new york in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  which included street closures  traffic flow restrictions and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour 
although these restrictions have been eased  the city of new york has considered other actions  including higher tolls  increased taxes and vehicle occupancy requirements in certain circumstances  which could adversely impact the company 
the company is also affected by zoning and use restrictions  increases in real estate taxes  and other laws and regulations that are common to any business that owns real estate 
the company is subject to numerous federal  state and local employment and labor laws and regulations  including title vii of the civil rights act of  as amended  the civil rights act of  the age discrimination in employment act of  the family medical leave act  wage and hour laws  and various state and local employment discrimination and human rights laws 
several cities in which the company has operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so called living wage ordinances which could adversely impact the company s profitability by requiring companies that contract with local governmental authorities and other employers to increase wages to levels substantially above the federal minimum wage 
in addition  the company is subject to provisions of the occupational safety and health act of  as amended osha and related regulations 
various other governmental regulations affect the company s operation of parking facilities  both directly and indirectly  including the americans with disabilities act ada 
under the ada  public accommodations  including many parking facilities  are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
for example  the ada generally requires garages to include handicapped spaces  headroom for wheelchair vans  and elevators that are operable by disabled persons 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of parking facilities  the company may be liable for any such costs 
although central parking is currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against it  there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against the company 
the cost 
table of contents of defending against claims of liability  or remediating a contaminated property  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company also is subject to various federal and state antitrust and consumer laws and regulations including the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the hsr act  which requires notification filings and waiting periods in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
in connection with the company s merger with allright corporation allright in march  the antitrust division of the united states department of justice filed a complaint in us district court for the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the merger on antitrust grounds 
in addition  the company received notices from several states  including tennessee  texas  illinois and maryland  that the attorneys general of those states were reviewing the merger from an antitrust perspective 
several of these states also requested certain information relating to the merger and the operations of central parking and allright in the form of civil investigative demands 
central parking and allright entered into a settlement agreement with the antitrust division on march   under which the two companies agreed to divest a total of parking facilities in cities  representing approximately  parking spaces 
the settlement agreement also prohibited central parking and allright from  among other things  operating any of the divested properties for a period of two years following the divestiture of each facility 
the two year prohibition on operating the divested properties has expired 
none of the states that reviewed the transaction from an antitrust perspective became a party to the settlement agreement with the antitrust division and several of the states continued their investigation of the merger after the allright merger was consummated 
the completion of any future mergers or acquisitions by the company is subject to the filing requirements described above and possible review by the department of justice or the federal trade commission and various state attorneys general 
certain of the company s fee collection activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection or debt collection laws and regulations 
employees as of september   the company employed  individuals  including  full time and  part time employees 
approximately  u 
s 
employees are represented by labor unions 
various union locals represent parking attendants and cashiers at the new york city facilities 
other cities in which some of the company s employees are represented by labor unions include washington  dc  miami  detroit  philadelphia  san francisco  jersey city  newark  atlantic city  pittsburgh  los angeles  st 
louis  columbus  chicago and san juan  puerto rico 
the company frequently is engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with various union locals 
the company s employees in pittsburgh approximately employees currently are on strike but the company has not experienced any significant labor strikes 
management believes that the company s employee relations are good 
service marks and trademarks the company has registered the names cpc  central parking system and central parking corporation  and its logo with the united states patent and trademark office and has the right to use them throughout the united states except in certain areas  including the chicago and atlantic city areas where two other companies have the exclusive right to use the name central parking 
the company also owns registered trademarks for square industries  kinney system  allied parking and allright parking and operates various parking locations under those names 
the company uses the name chicago parking system in chicago and cps parking in seattle and milwaukee 
the company has registered the name control plus and its symbol in london and has registered that name and symbol in association with its on street parking activities in richmond  virginia

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following specific risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report  as these are important factors  among others  that could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results 
it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all of our potential risks or uncertainties 
our financial performance is sensitive to changes in economic conditions that may impact employment and consumer spending and commercial office occupancy 
the most recent general economic slowdown in the united states adversely affected employment levels  consumer spending and commercial office occupancy  which  in turn  reduced the demand for parking 
the reduced demand for parking negatively impacted our revenues and net income 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates  are also likely to adversely affect our business 
our concentration of operations in the northeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states  particularly in new york city  increases the risk of negative financial fluctuations due to events or factors that affect these areas 
our operations in the northeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states  which includes the cities of new york  newark  boston  philadelphia  pittsburgh  baltimore and washington  dc generated approximately of our total revenues excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses in fiscal year revenues from our operations in new york city and surrounding areas accounted for approximately of our total revenues excluding reimbursement of management expenses in fiscal the concentration of operations in these areas increases the risk that local or regional events or factors that affect these cities or regions such as severe winter weather  labor strikes  changes in local or state laws and regulations  economic conditions or acts of terrorism  can have a disproportionate impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we have found material weaknesses in our internal controls that require remediation and concluded  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  that our internal controls over financial reporting at september  were not effective 
as we disclose in part ii  item a  controls and procedures of this form k  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september  while we are taking immediate steps to correct our internal control weaknesses  the material weaknesses that have been discovered will not be considered remediated until the new and improved internal controls operate for a period of time  are tested and it is concluded that such new and improved internal controls are operating effectively 
pending the successful completion of such testing  we will perform mitigating procedures relating to our internal control weaknesses 
any failure to implement and maintain the improvements in the controls over our financial reporting  or difficulties encountered in the implementation of these improvements in our controls  could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
any failure to improve our internal controls to address the identified material weakness could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock 
changes in the insurance marketplace  including significantly higher premiums  higher deductibles and coverage restrictions and increased claims costs  have negatively impacted our net income in recent years and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future 
we purchase insurance covering certain types of claims that occur at parking facilities we own  lease or manage 
in addition  we purchase worker s compensation  group health  director s and officer s liability and certain other insurance coverages 
due to changes in the insurance marketplace  we have experienced in recent years a substantial increase in the premiums we pay for most types of insurance coverage and an increase in the deductibles relating to such coverage 
we also have experienced an increase in certain claims costs  including worker s compensation  liability and group health 
in addition  coverages of certain types of risk  such as terrorism coverage  have been significantly restricted or are no longer available at a reasonable cost 
the changes in the insurance marketplace  including increased premium and claims costs  higher deductibles and coverage restrictions  have negatively impacted our earnings in recent years and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future 
acts of terrorism  such as the september  attacks  can have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we estimate that the terrorist attacks on september  reduced our revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year by approximately million and approximately million in the first half of fiscal year not only did the attack cause physical damage to some of the parking facilities operated by us  but the reduction in the number of commuters parking in the areas affected  reduction in tourists and local consumers traveling to the area as well as the broader reduction in airplane travel and lower attendance at sporting events  concerts and other venues  also impacted our operations adversely 
the closing of streets in the vicinity of the world trade center and other areas of new york city and the imposition of certain restrictions on traffic and other security measures in new york city and at the nation s airports also had a negative impact on our operations 
our operations are concentrated heavily in the downtown areas of major us cities and some are located near landmarks or other sites that have been mentioned as potential targets of terrorists 
in addition  we manage the parking operations at approximately airports 
additional terrorist attacks or the imposition of additional security measures  particularly in new york  washington  dc or other major cities in which we have a significant presence  or at airports  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the offer or sale of a substantial amount of our common stock by significant shareholders could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
in february  we filed a registration statement on form s covering  shares of our common stock held by certain shareholders 
these shares were registered pursuant to registration rights previously 
table of contents granted to these shareholders 
although we believe a significant portion of these shares has been sold  these shareholders may sell any remaining shares that were registered on any stock exchange  market or trading facility on which the shares are traded  or in private transactions 
other substantial shareholders  including the chairman of central parking  monroe carell  jr  the carell children s trust  and other family members and related entities the carell family  are permitted to sell significant amounts of our common stock under rule and other exemptions from registration under the federal securities laws 
in addition  the carell family has certain rights to register substantially all of the shares held by the family and related entities 
the offer or sale of substantial amounts of our common stock by these or other significant shareholders  particularly if such offers or sales occur simultaneously or relatively close in time  could have a significant negative impact on our stock s market price 
we are dependent on the continued availability of capital to support our business 
we have significant working capital requirements  including but not limited to  repair and maintenance obligations for many of our parking facilities 
we are dependant on the cash generated from our operations and credit facility to meet our working capital requirements 
the credit facility contains covenants including those that require us to maintain certain financial ratios  restrict further indebtedness and certain acquisition activity and limit the amount of dividends paid 
the primary ratios are a leverage ratio  senior leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
quarterly compliance is calculated using a four quarter rolling methodology and measured against certain targets 
our inability to meet debt covenants and debt service payments under the credit facility would have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon our financing  investing and cash management activities 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a tier based margin dependent upon certain financial ratios 
there are separate tiers for the revolving loan and term loan 
the weighted average margin as of september   was basis points 
the amount outstanding under our credit facility was million with a weighted average interest rate of as of september  we have reduced a portion of our interest rate risk by executing two interest rate swap transactions whereby we have fixed million of floating rate debt 
the term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly payments of million through march and quarterly payments of million from june through march an increase decrease in libor of would result in no increase decrease of annual interest expense since the swaps  which converted the rates to fixed  totaled and the credit facility  which was all floating interest  was million on september  we expect to pay both quarterly principle amortization and monthly interest payments out of operating cash flow 
our large number of leased and owned facilities increases the risk that we may become unprofitable and that we may not be able to cover the fixed costs of our leased and owned facilities 
we leased or owned  facilities as of september  although there is more potential for income from leased and owned facilities than from management contracts  they also carry more risk if there is a downturn in the economy  property performance or commercial real estate occupancy rates because a significant part of the costs to operate such facilities typically is fixed 
for example  in the case of leases  there are typically minimum lease payments that must be made regardless of the revenues or profitability of the facility 
in particular  it is difficult to forecast revenues of newly constructed parking facilities because these facilities do not have an operating history 
start up costs  the length of the break in period during which parking demand is built and economic conditions at the time the facility is opened  are very difficult to predict at the time the lease is executed and the base rent is agreed upon  which is often two or more years prior to the opening of the facility 
in the case of owned facilities  there are the normal risks of ownership and costs of capital 
in addition  operating expenses for both leased and owned facilities are borne by us and are not passed through to the owner  as is the case with management contracts 
in the case of owned facilities and generally in the case of longer term leased facilities  we also are responsible for property taxes and all maintenance and repair costs  including structural  mechanical and systems repairs 
performance of our parking facilities depends  in part  on our ability to negotiate favorable contract terms and control operating expenses  economic conditions prevailing generally and in areas where parking facilities are located  the nature and extent of competitive parking facilities in the area  weather conditions and the real estate market 
an increase in government regulation or taxation could have a negative effect on our profitability 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  and in some cases  municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities 
in addition  many cities impose a substantial tax or surcharge on parking services  which generally range from to 
substantial increases in the tax or surcharge on parking such as occurred in recent years in pittsburgh and miami can have a significant negative effect on profitability in a given city 
the profitability of our business is also affected by increases in property taxes because the company is responsible for paying property taxes on its owned properties and on many of its leased facilities 
several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that are designed to encourage car pooling or the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage 
an example is the restrictions imposed by the city of new york in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  which included street closures and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour 
we also are subject to federal  state and local employment 
table of contents and labor laws and regulations  and several cities in which we have operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so called living wage ordinances 
the adoption of such laws and regulations  the imposition of additional parking taxes or surcharges and increases in property and other taxes could adversely impact our profitability 
the sureties for our performance bond program may increase rates and require additional collateral to issue or renew performance bonds in support of certain contracts 
under substantially all of our contracts with municipalities and government entities and airports  we are required to provide a performance bond to support our obligations under the contract 
we are also required to provide performance bonds under certain leases and other contracts with non governmental entities 
due to our financial results in recent years and the financial state of the surety bond industry  the sureties for our performance bond program have increased our rates and have required us to collateralize a greater percentage of our performance bonds with letters of credit 
as a result  our working capital needs have increased and our borrowing capacity has decreased since letters of credit used by us to collateralize surety bonds reduces the availability of funds under our credit facility 
although we believe our performance bond program is adequate for its present needs  if we are unable to provide sufficient collateral in the future  our sureties may not issue or renew performance bonds to support our obligations under certain contracts 
as is customary in the industry  a surety provider can refuse to provide a bond principal with new or renewal surety bonds 
if any existing or future surety provider refuses to provide us with surety bonds  there can be no assurance that we would be able to find alternate providers on acceptable terms  or at all 
our inability to provide surety bonds could result in the loss of existing contracts or future business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our net income could be adversely affected if accruals for future insurance losses are not adequate 
we provide liability  medical and worker s compensation insurance coverage 
we are obligated to pay for each loss incurred up to the amount of a deductible specified in our insurance policies 
our financial statements reflect our anticipated costs based upon loss experience and guidance and evaluation we have received from third party insurance professionals  such as actuaries 
there can be no assurance  however  that the ultimate amount of such costs will not exceed the amounts presently accrued  in which case we would need to increase accruals and pay additional expenses 
the operation of our business is dependent on key personnel 
our success is  and will continue to be  substantially dependent upon the continued services of our management team 
the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations 
although we have entered into employment agreements with  and historically have been successful in retaining the services of our senior management  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these senior management people in the future 
in addition  our future growth depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled operating managers and employees 
we have foreign operations that may be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we operate in the united kingdom  germany  the republic of ireland and other countries 
for the year ended september   revenues from foreign operations represented of our total revenue  excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses 
our united kingdom operations accounted for of total revenues from foreign operations  excluding reimbursement of management contract expense and excluding earnings from joint ventures 
we receive revenues and incur expenses in various foreign currencies in connection with our foreign operations and  as a result  we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we intend to continue to invest in certain foreign leased or owned parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  where appropriate  and may become increasingly exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
we believe we have currently limited exposure to foreign currency risk and do not have a foreign currency hedging program 
in connection with ownership or operation of parking facilities  we may be liable for environmental problems 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us or against our owned or operated parking facilities 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or of remediating a contaminated property  could have a negative effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents if we cannot maintain positive relationships with labor unions representing our employees  a work stoppage may adversely affect our business 
approximately  employees are represented by labor unions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms 
employees could exercise their rights under these labor union contracts  which could include a strike or walk out 
in such cases  there are no assurances that we would be able to staff sufficient employees for its short term needs 
any such labor strike or our inability to negotiate a satisfactory contract upon expiration of the current agreements could have a negative effect on our business and financial results 
the failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business and the market price of its common stock 
we completed the acquisition of sterling ltd in fiscal year and may seek additional acquisition opportunities on a selective basis in the future 
we can give no assurance that any acquired facility or company will be successfully integrated into our operations 
also  because of the purchase price paid by us or because of the performance of acquired operations after such acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the results of the acquired operations will not be dilutive to our per share earnings 
any acquisition contemplated or completed by us may result in adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  divert management s attention  introduce difficulties in retaining  hiring and training key personnel  and introduce risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  some or all of which could have a negative effect on our business and financial results 
item properties the company s facilities  as of september   are organized into segments which are subdivided into regions as detailed below
