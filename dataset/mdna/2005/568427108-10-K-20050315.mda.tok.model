item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products corporation  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail customers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floorplan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail customers  providing to our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to maximize profitability and reduce risk in the event of a downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly in the event of an industry downturn  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  maximizing shareholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to shareholders  and the repurchase of its common stock on the open market  aligning the interests of our management and shareholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of its various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our market share  unit sales of our products  average sale price per unit  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
industry trends during were highlighted by higher wholesale and retail powerboat sales  due to continued low interest rates  an improving domestic economy  and a shift in consumer preferences after september  towards safe recreational activities in a controlled environment close to home  which do not involve air travel 
improving industry conditions have been reflected in marine products financial results  and have also resulted in management s decision to increase production in existing facilities and consider expansion of its productive capacity 
the results of our strategies and the improving industry conditions are reflected in our financial results and operating statistics 
we generated record sales and profits in net sales of million increased percent compared to the prior year 
net sales increased due to a percent increase in unit sales and a percent increase in the average selling price per boat 
unit sales and average selling price increased in each of our four models 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was percent  approximately the same as the prior year 
our gross profit margin did not improve in as it has in prior years 
although we continued to execute our strategies of building larger  more profitable models and managing our production for optimum efficiency  these profitability improvements were offset by an increase in raw materials costs  and increases in discounts to our dealers on selected models  which we determined would be prudent in order to improve our model mix 
we responded to the increase in raw materials costs by instituting a price increase of one to one and a half percent effective january  we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  a decline from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
this decline was concentrated in the smaller size boats in our market  the to foot range 
this decline was the result of two factors the execution of our stated strategy of selling larger  more profitable boats  and the strategy of certain of our competitors  who have built and sold a large number of entry level smaller boats which are constructed in offshore manufacturing plants with lower cost labor 
although we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  we also believe that maintaining profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that net sales and profits will continue to increase in  based on the projections of continued low interest rates and improving economic conditions 
this belief is also based on reports of attendance and sales during the winter retail boat show exhibition season  which began in december media reports regarding recent boat show exhibitions indicate that attendance has increased by as much as percent compared to last year  although several shows reported decreased attendance due to inclement weather 
boat show attendance has historically been positively correlated with retail boat sales later in the selling season because consumers attend shows due to their interest in recreational boating and make purchasing decisions at a boat show exhibition 
however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will continue in or subsequent years 
pleasure boating is a discretionary consumer expenditure  therefore  an increase in interest rates or decline in consumer confidence due to a weakening economy  continued global conflict  rising interest costs or fuel costs could have a serious and immediate negative impact on sales and profits 
at the present time  marine products as well as other manufacturers are refining and improving their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
management believes that these efforts may result in increased marketing and other selling  general and administrative expenses in the future 
our ability to grow our sales and profits in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  fuel costs  consumer confidence  the continued acceptance of our products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials 
results of operations the board of directors  at their quarterly meeting on january   authorized a three for two stock split by the issuance on march  of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at february  accordingly  the par value of additional shares issued will be adjusted between common stock and capital in excess of par value  and fractional shares resulting from the stock split will be settled in cash 
all share data have been retroactively adjusted for this split and the stock split effective march  s in thousands total number of boats sold average gross selling price per boat net sales percentage of cost of goods sold to net sales percentage of selling  general and administrative expense to net sales operating income warranty expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales increased by million or percent in compared to the increase was due to a percent increase in the number of units sold  an percent increase in the average selling price per unit  and an increase in parts and accessories sales 
the increase in the number of units sold was realized in the chaparral sportboat and deckboat lines  but included increased unit sales in all product lines 
the increase in average selling price occurred among all product lines as well  but was highest in the chaparral sportboat line  which sold more large sportboats than in  in addition to the overall price increases implemented for the model year that began in july in addition  the company eliminated the lower priced ss sportboat in increased sales of larger robalo sport fishing boats and chaparral cruisers were also responsible for the average selling price increase during the increase in parts and accessories sales was a result of the increasing numbers of boats sold in prior years that are still in operation and require routine maintenance and repair 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent in compared to  consistent with the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods decreased slightly from to  because of leverage gained from higher production volumes and an overall shift in model mix to larger boats which typically generate higher gross margins 
this was partially offset by a significant increase in selected raw material costs  including stainless steel and resin costs  from to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from costs that vary with increased sales and profitability  such as incentive compensation  sales commissions and warranty expense  in addition to increased costs associated with public company compliance 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses did not vary materially 
marine products provides a five year transferable hull structural warranty on chaparral products against defects in material and workmanship and a year transferable structural hull warranty on robalo products 
a one year warranty on components is provided as well 
the engine manufacturer warrants engines included in the boats 
warranty expense was percent of net sales in and warranty expense increased in due to increased sales 
interest income 
interest income was million in compared to million in marine products generates interest income from investment of its available cash primarily in overnight and marketable securities 
the increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher investment returns in together with a higher balance of investable funds 
income tax provision 
the effective tax rate was slightly lower at percent in compared to percent in the income tax provision of million was percent higher than the income tax provision in as a result of higher income before income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales increased by million or percent in compared to the increase was primarily due to an percent increase in units sold  as well as a percent increase in the average selling price of boats sold 
the increases in units sold were realized primarily in the chaparral sportboat and cruiser lines  and in the robalo sport fishing boat line 
the increase in average selling prices resulted from increased sales of larger cruisers  increased robalo unit sales  and overall price increases that were implemented for the model year  which began in july the net sales increase was also due to higher parts and accessories sales  which is a result of the increasing numbers of boats sold in prior years that are still in operation and require routine maintenance and repair 
management believes that in general  the increase in unit volume during the year resulted from favorable economic and industry conditions  including continued low interest rates  an improving domestic economy  and a trend in which consumers choose recreational activities that are safe  close to home  and can be enjoyed in a controlled environment with family and friends 
the available industry statistics also indicate that chaparral continued to gain market share in the to foot sterndrive pleasure boat market during  which management believes was due to increased industry recognition of the company s product quality  enhanced dealer incentive and training programs  and new boat models with designs and features that had broader consumer appeal 
the robalo unit sales increased by percent  due to an expanded model offering including larger sizes and more available design options  which led to broader dealer acceptance of the robalo line and ultimately increased sales volumes 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent in compared to  consistent with the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from to  because of efficiencies gained from higher production volumes  especially within the robalo line  and an overall shift in model mix to larger boats which typically generate higher margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of percent 
the company continued to create some expense leverage with higher net sales 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from costs that vary with increased sales and profitability  such as incentive compensation  sales commissions and warranty expense  as well as increased costs associated with public company compliance 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in research and development expense  related to fewer new model design activities in compared to when the company performed a large cruiser design project and several projects to expand the robalo line 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased because the incentive compensation and sales commission expenses were higher due to the increase in gross profit margin and operating margin percents 
marine products provides a five year transferable hull structural warranty on chaparral products against defects in material and workmanship and a year transferable structural hull warranty on robalo products 
a one year warranty on components is provided as well 
the engine manufacturer warrants engines included in the boats 
warranty expense was percent of net sales in and percent of net sales in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales increased in due to increased sales of cruisers which generally incur higher warranty claim costs as a percentage of net sales due to additional features and increased customer service demands in this boat line 
interest income 
interest income was million in compared to million in marine products generates interest income from investment of its available cash primarily in overnight and marketable securities 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower investment returns in consistent with lower interest rates offset slightly by a higher balance of investable funds 
income tax provision 
the effective tax rate was percent in  compared to percent in the decrease in rate reflects the effect of implementing tax planning strategies 
the effective rate change increased net income by million 
the income tax provision of million was million or percent higher than the income tax provision of million for the prior year as a result of higher income before income taxes  partially offset by the lower effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the twelve months ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for provided by investing activities net cash used for financing activities cash provided by operating activities increased during by million compared to the increase was due to higher operating income in compared to  together with lower working capital requirements in primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable together with increases in accounts payable  caused by timing differences 
cash used for investing activities decreased million compared to this change was caused by a million net decrease in marketable securities in compared to due to a large number of current marketable securities coming due in december that were not reinvested until early capital expenditures decreased slightly to million in compared to million in in  the capital expenditures were primarily for additions to certain manufacturing plants and purchase of operating equipment 
in  the largest capital expenditures related to the completion of construction of the administrative building at chaparral s nashville  georgia headquarters which was begun in  the purchase of operating equipment  and the purchase of additional buildings for warehouse storage space 
cash used for financing activities increased million in compared to the increase resulted from higher cash amounts used to purchase the company s common stock in the open market  and an increase in dividends resulting from the company s decision during the first quarter of to increase its quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
cash provided by operating activities increased during by million compared to the increase was due to higher operating income in compared to  partially offset by higher working capital requirements in cash used for investing activities increased million compared to this change was caused by overall increase in available cash for investment

cash used for financing activities increased million in compared to the increase relates to cash used to purchase the company s common stock in the open market  and an increase in dividends resulting from the company s decision during the first quarter of to increase its quarterly dividend 
financial condition and liquidity the company s financial condition as of december   was strong 
we believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our overall strong capitalization including no debt  and cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
we believe our liquidity will allow us the ability to continue to grow and provide us the opportunity to take advantage of strategic business opportunities that may arise 
cash requirements management expects that capital expenditures during will be approximately million  and are projected to include investment towards enhancements to certain manufacturing plants and purchase of a parts warehouse 
we expect that additional contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of approximately million will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective 
on january   the board of directors approved a percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend  from to 
based on the shares outstanding on december   the aggregate annual amount would be approximately million 
the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders  subject to the earnings and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors 
the company has an agreement with two employees  which provides for a monthly payment to each of the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market pursuant to a resolution in april by the board of directors and  as of december   can buy back  additional shares under the program 
refer to issuer purchases of equity securities on page for details regarding shares purchased in the fourth quarter of contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payment is known 
these amounts include primarily known pension plan funding obligations 
these amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various dealers and selected third party lenders to guarantee varying amounts of qualifying dealers debt obligations 
the company s obligation under these guarantees becomes effective in the case of default by the dealer 
the agreements provide for the return of all repossessed boats in like new condition to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the dealers unpaid debt obligation on those boats 
as of december   the maximum repurchase obligation outstanding under these agreements which expire in and totaled approximately million 
the company has recorded the estimated fair value of this guarantee  at december   this amount is immaterial and did not change from the prior year 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party 
marine products reimbursed rpc for its estimated allocable share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of marine products totaling  in   in and  in the company s directors are also directors of rpc and all of the executive officers with the exception of mr 
lane are employees of both the company and rpc 
the company paid  in and  in to a division of rpc for the purchase  installation and service of overhead cranes 
the employee benefits agreement provides for  among other things  the company s employees to continue participating subsequent to the spin off in two rpc sponsored benefit plans  specifically  the defined contribution k plan and the defined benefit retirement income plan 
following the spin off of the company in  rpc has charged the company for  and the company has been obligated to pay  its allocable share of pension costs and the associated funding obligation related to the prior service liabilities of chaparral employees 
effective december  the related prior service liabilities totaling  and pension assets totaling  were transferred within the multiple employer plan by rpc to the company 
accordingly  during  the pension costs and funding obligations were incurred directly by the company 
the tax sharing and indemnification agreement provides for  among other things  the treatment of income tax matters for periods through the date of the spin off and responsibility for any adjustments as a result of audit by any taxing authority 
the general terms provide for the indemnification for any tax detriment incurred by one party caused by the other party s action 
the amounts transferred as settlements from rpc to the company totaled approximately  in  in and  in critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers other time specific or model specific incentives 
the retail incentive programs have historically been used during off peak selling seasons in addition to the winter boat exhibition shows 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which units have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives as a percentage of gross sales have been percent in  percent in  and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating income by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and our enforcement of those terms  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent for  percent in  and percent for the year a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately million

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any controls system

also  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud  if any  within the company will be detected 
further  the design of a controls system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
the company intends to continually improve and refine its internal controls

our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances
