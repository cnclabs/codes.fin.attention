general stac  inc stac incorporated hifn as a wholly owned subsidiary on august  on november   stac transferred its semiconductor business  along with the associated technology  assets and liabilities  to hifn in exchange for  shares of hifn series a preferred stock and shares of hifn common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
on march   the company completed its initial public offering when it was spun off from stac  inc the initial public offering raised approximately million  net of offering expenses  followed by an additional million when the company s underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares of hifn s common stock on april  industry background the need for a more effective use of and efficient communication utilizing the public network infrastructure in a business environment is one of the main drivers of the extensive deployment of network based communications systems 
the resulting increase in connectivity has further driven the need for technology that safeguards and manages the access to information available over these expanding global networks 
the network computing market has undergone several major transitions over the past decade and it is the convergence of these transitions that contributed to the recent increase in global connectivity 
one of these transitions was the migration of corporate computing environments from centralized mainframe systems to distributed client server environments 
the ability to access and share information through client server technology expanded the need for connectivity beyond workgroup local area networks lans to enterprise wide networks spanning multiple lans and wide area networks wans 
another transition was the widespread adoption of the internet for business to business communications 
internet based business applications have expanded beyond e mail to a broad range of business applications and services including electronic publishing  direct to customer transactions  product marketing  advertising and customer support 
yet another transition was the emergence of consumer to business or e commerce communications 
the convergence of these major transitions led to the need for secure  managed communications and the emergence of vpns that use the internet infrastructure and associated protocols and applications to share information and services  both within the enterprise and with business partners and customers 
as a result of adding security to the network infrastructure  businesses are able to share internal 
table of contents information and run enterprise applications across geographically dispersed facilities as well as enable customers  suppliers and other business partners to inexpensively link into their enterprise information systems 
as businesses and consumers demand more functionality from their networks  and as they adopt wireless networks into their infrastructure  the need for layered security  while maintaining performance  will be a driving factor for products such as our network  security and compression processors 
the complexity of and need for network security driven to provide the significant benefits of connectivity and information exchange  organizations potentially expose sensitive information and mission critical applications to unauthorized access  both through connections to the internet and from within the enterprise 
in addition  transmission of data over the internet may also expose such data to unauthorized interception 
these risks create a critical need for enterprises to protect their information and information systems from unauthorized access and use 
historical methods for securing information resources are no longer adequate to meet the security requirements of today s global networks 
today s distributed network environments provide multiple points of access and multiple network resources  making it impractical to individually secure every application and resource on the network 
therefore  additional layers of security at the network level are required to control access to the network and to regulate and protect the flow of data between network segments 
the increasing demands placed on data communication security systems by the expansion of internet services and global enterprise networking quickly outpaces the capabilities of many traditional internet security appliance architectures 
these demands include the need to define and transparently enforce an integrated  enterprise wide security policy that can be managed centrally and implemented on a distributed basis 
an effective network security solution also needs to be open and extensible to enable it to address the rapidly changing requirements of the internet and intranets  including the addition of new security applications  such as authentication  encryption  url filtering  anti virus protection  spyware  intrusion detection and java and activex security services and functions 
this increased complexity  along with the higher demand placed by ever increasing bandwidths and storage requirements  some of which are driven by regulations  and the increasing number of users has given rise to the creation of data communications semiconductors specifically designed for the security task 
these high performance security integrated circuits create the next generation security platform for our customers based on a combination of protocol features  customer complex core logic and standards based buses and interfaces 
this is at the core of hifn s network security processor products 
the hifn solution hifn is a network and security market leader that supplies most major network and security equipment vendors with patented technology to accelerate and secure end customer data 
we design  develop and market high performance  multi protocol packet processors semiconductor devices and software designed to enable secure  high bandwidth network connectivity and comprehensive differentiation of business critical application network traffic from other general purpose network traffic 
we provide our customers with high performance  interoperable implementations of a wide variety of industry standard networking and storage protocols by offering efficient compression  encryption compression and public key cryptography products and solutions 
we believe that our patented compression technology comprises the fundamental know how for the design and implementation of low cost  high performance implementations of lossless data compression and is the recognized de facto standard  which gives our products a strong competitive advantage 
by offering a wide range of high performance implementations of our patented  standards compliant technology  we are able to sell products to network and storage equipment vendors that allow them to reduce development costs and get their products to market faster 
our patented lempel ziv stac compression technology lzs is incorporated into several networking protocol standards  including point to point protocol ppp and the frame relay protocol  allowing network equipment vendors to rapidly integrate proven solutions for mitigating the costs associated with traditional private leased line network architectures

table of contents in support of vpn architectures  we introduced the first network security processors  integrating the critical functions of compression  encryption and data authentication in compliance with the internet protocol security ipsec  secure session layer ssl  transport layer security tls and proposed advanced encryption standard aes ciphersuite extensions to tls protocols 
this integration allows network equipment vendors to add highly integrated  high performance vpn capabilities to their routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment and firewalls 
businesses rely on the internet to conduct their normal business operations 
unlike the traditional telecommunications network used by businesses to communicate  such as the fixed line telephone  the internet is vastly more complex  unreliable and generally not secure 
in addition  there is an overall lack of differentiation or prioritization of business critical applications from general use of the internet 
these applications tend to be bundled together and use the same resources throughout the internet 
our flow classification solutions enable the integration of precise differentiation and measurement of business critical transactions within network equipment vendors devices 
this feature allows the creation of differentiated services within the internet  enabling our oem customers to provide valuable differentiation services to their customers 
hifn s line of compression processors targeted at back up storage applications provides storage equipment vendors with high performance implementations of our patented compression technology  doubling the capacity and performance of mid to high end tape drive systems

additionally  our compression products provide companies in the storage market that develop disk to disk and the disk to disk to tape back up products with solutions that meet their performance and capacity requirements 
customers and products a number of leading manufacturers of network and storage equipment have designed products that incorporate the hifn solutions 
to date  we have secured design wins with a number of networking  security and storage equipment vendors 
to qualify as a design win  an equipment vendor must have ordered samples of our products or an evaluation or reference board and initiated a product design that incorporates our solutions 
during the design in process  we work with each customer  providing training on our products  assisting in resolving technical questions and providing price and delivery information to assist the customer in getting our products into volume production 
we cannot assure that any of the design wins we have secured will result in demand for our products 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market and we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
at september   we had a backlog of semiconductor orders representing million of products deliverable to customers over the months following the placement of these orders 
at september   we had a backlog of million 
because we quote product lead times to customers of approximately three to five months  most products shipped during a quarter are ordered during the previous quarter 
since customers may reschedule or cancel orders  subject to negotiated windows  orders scheduled for shipment in a quarter may be moved to a subsequent quarter or cancelled altogether 
therefore  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales

in addition  we cannot assure that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our success depends upon protecting our intellectual property 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patents  mask work rights  intellectual property or copyrights on certain of our products and technologies 
although we are not currently a party to any material litigation regarding intellectual property  in the event a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license relating to such intellectual property was not available on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may also be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the occurrence of litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change and our success depends upon protecting our intellectual property 
in addition  we claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  we cannot assure that these measures will be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties we face risks associated with our international business activities 

table of contents export restrictions on encryption algorithms a key element of hifn s packet processor architecture is the encryption algorithms embedded in our semiconductor and software products 
these products are subject to export control regulations administered by the us department of commerce 
the regulations permit our domestic network equipment customers to export non military specific products incorporating our encryption technology only after the finished product has received a one time technical review from the department of commerce 
in addition  those us export control laws prohibit the export of many products  including any products with encryption  to a number of countries deemed hostile by the us government currently there are nine such countries 
furthermore  us government regulations require export licenses from the department of state for all military specific products 
the sale of our packet processors could be hindered or harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required technical reviews or by the costs of compliance 
see sales  marketing technical support and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our products are subject to export restrictions 
competition the networking and storage equipment markets into which we sell our products are intensely competitive and are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  unit price erosion and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is also intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and unit price erosion 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets  including certain customers  with similar or substitute solutions that may be less costly or provide better performance or features than our products 
to be successful in the future  we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to changing customer performance  feature and pricing requirements  technological change and competitors innovations 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our markets are highly competitive 
our products compete with products from companies such as safenet  inc  broadcom corporation  cavium networks  freescale semiconductor  inc  intel corporation  agere systems and applied micro circuits corporation amcc 
hifn was a wholly owned subsidiary of stac  inc until hifn s spin off from stac in upon which stac assigned two license agreements with ibm  entered into in  in which stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also assigned its license agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft  entered into in  whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
the license agreement with microsoft  however  prohibits microsoft from creating hardware implementations of our patents 
we also compete against software solutions that use general purpose microprocessors to run encryption algorithms and our software compression libraries 
in addition  as noted above  our encryption compression and public key processors are subject to export control restrictions administered by the us department of commerce  which permit our network equipment customers to export products incorporating encryption technology only after receiving a one time technical review 
as a result of these regulations  sales by foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their encryption products could hinder or harm the sale of our encryption compression and public key processors to network equipment customers in the global market 
however  we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered or indicated intent to enter the network equipment market 
we may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential customers internally develop application specific integrated circuits  general purpose microprocessors and other devices that attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
such competitors 
table of contents may have proprietary semiconductor manufacturing ability  preferred vendor status with many of our customers  extensive marketing power and name recognition  greater financial resources than us and other significant advantages over us 
in addition  current and potential competitors may determine  for strategic reasons  to consolidate  to lower the price of their products substantially or to bundle their products with other products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that important competitive factors in our markets are price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  the continued emergence of new industry standards  length of development cycles  design wins with major network and storage equipment vendors  support for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  technical service and support and protection of products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws 
our failure to successfully develop products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers in the market would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer such distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms on a higher volume of business  such distributors or sales representatives may decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our markets are highly competitive 
research and development our success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  substantial investments in research and development 
extensive product development input is obtained from customers and through our participation in industry organizations and standards setting bodies including the internet engineering task force ietf  the storage networking industry association snia  as well as the optical internetworking forum and the network processing forum 
as of september   our research and development staff consisted of employees 
our research and development expenditures were million in the fiscal year ended september   million in the fiscal year ended september  and million in the fiscal year ended september   representing  and of net revenues for such periods  respectively 
research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities  costs of fabricating chip mask sets and subcontracting costs 
we perform our research and product development activities at our facilities in los gatos and carlsbad  california  framingham  massachusetts  morrisville  north carolina and hangzhou  people s republic of china 
the acquisition of pattern matching technology in september  of certain assets of ibm in december  of netoctave in september and of apptitude in august further strengthened our strategy of expanding our current markets with technologies that are complementary to our core competencies 
the addition of the new hardware  software and intellectual property to our product portfolio enables us to continue to broaden our reach into potentially high margin markets 
for example  these acquisitions enable us to expand our product base to include converged security appliances  emerging storage security markets  high performance ipsec  acceleration for firewall applications  bandwidth management  and qos and cos functionality 
our future performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  properly identify target markets and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate well in 
table of contents advance the future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  industry standards and competitive product offerings 
we cannot assure that our design and introduction schedules for any additions and enhancements to our existing and future products will be able to be sold at prices that are favorable to us 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue enhancing the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex and require long development cycles 
such innovations must be completed before developments in networking technologies or standards render them obsolete and must be sufficiently compelling to induce network and storage equipment vendors to favor them over alternative technologies 
moreover  we must generally incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product line can be ascertained 
we cannot assure that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development 
the failure to successfully develop new products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

sales  marketing technical support we market our products through a direct sales and marketing organization  headquartered in los gatos  california  with sales offices in massachusetts  texas and north carolina as well as in china  the united kingdom and the netherlands 
we also market our products through independent contract sales representatives in the united states  europe  japan and other areas 
furthermore  we retain account managers to focus on individual customer relationships 
our customers in foreign countries are serviced through international distributors 
sales representatives are selected for their understanding of the marketplace and their ability to provide effective field sales support for our products 
our relationships with some of our sales representatives have been established within the last two years  and we are unable to predict the extent to which some of these representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
semiconductor and software sales to cisco systems  inc  an oem producer of networking equipment  through its manufacturing subcontractors  comprised  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
semiconductor sales to quantum corporation  through its manufacturing subcontractor  represented  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
semiconductor sales to huawei technologies  inc  an oem producer of networking equipment  represented and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
our customers are not subject to any binding obligation to order from us 
if our sales to cisco  quantum or huawei decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
for example  during the three months ended september   a combined decrease of in sales to cisco and huawei compared to the immediately preceding quarter resulted in significant reduction in our overall revenues and results of operations 
our most significant customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today for a number of reasons  including customers deployment schedules and budget considerations 
as a result  we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and an annual basis 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties we depend upon a small number of customers

our marketing efforts include participation in 
table of contents industry trade shows  technical conferences  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  the hifn website  our customer extranet site  electronic newsletters and direct mail distribution of our literature 
hifn has established a number of strategic partnerships for both the network and storage security processors 
hifn s efforts with these partners range from market and product development to participating in joint marketing programs 
hifn will continue to partner with companies that offer complementary technologies and market strengths 
technical support to customers is provided through field applications engineers and  if necessary  applications engineers and product designers 
local field support is provided in person or by telephone 
we believe that providing customers with comprehensive product service and support is critical to maintaining a competitive position in the market and is critical to shortening the time required to design in our products 
we work with our customers to monitor the performance of our product designs and to provide support at each stage of customer product development 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this has caused significant variances in product demand  production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices 
industry wide fluctuations in the future could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing currently  we subcontract all semiconductor manufacturing on a turnkey basis  with our suppliers delivering fully assembled and tested products based on our proprietary designs 
the use of the fabless model allows us to focus substantially all of our resources on determining customer requirements and on the design  development and support of our products 
this model also allows us to have significantly reduced capital requirements 
we subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  toshiba corporation  ibm and philips semiconductor 
these manufacturers were selected based on the breadth of available technology  quality  manufacturing capacity and support for design tools that we use 
none of our products are currently manufactured by more than one supplier 
however  in the event one of our suppliers notifies us that it intends to cease manufacturing a product  we expect that we will have an adequate opportunity to order sufficient quantities of the affected products so that shipments to customers will not be adversely affected while we qualify a new manufacturer 
we use mature and proven technology processes for the manufacture of our products  avoiding dependence on the latest process technology available 
this approach reduces our technical risks and avoids the risks related to production capacity constraints typically associated with leading edge semiconductor processes 
this approach also allows us to focus on providing differentiated functionality in our products 
our current main products are manufactured using     
and 
micron complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos processes 
products under development are being designed with the 
micron cmos process 
we believe that transitioning our products to increasingly smaller semiconductor dimensions will be important for us to remain competitive 
we cannot assure that future process migration will be achieved without difficulty 
for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue to rely on our subcontract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and test requirements 
all of our subcontract manufacturers produce products for other companies 
we do not have long term manufacturing agreements with any of our subcontract manufacturers 
our subcontract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order that has been accepted by one of our subcontract manufacturers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
as a result  we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
failure of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity to rise 
table of contents along with a rise in demand could result in our subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to customers that are larger or have long term supply contracts in place 
our inability to obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or any delay or interruption in supply  could reduce our product revenue or increase our cost of revenue and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations

employees as of september   hifn employed a total of full time employees 
of the total number of employees  were employed in research and development  in sales and marketing  eight in operations and in finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe our employee relations are good 
the competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we operate is intense  particularly for engineering personnel with related security  networking and integrated circuit design expertise  and applications support personnel with networking product design expertise 
we believe our future success is heavily dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
to date  we believe we have been successful in recruiting qualified personnel  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

table of contents in september  hifn acquired intellectual property for million in cash  including acquisition related costs 
assets acquired include developed and core technology and acquired workforce 
in connection with this asset acquisition  in fiscal year  we recognized  of research and development expense for the completion of certain development milestones at predefined deadlines 
on february   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors for the private placement of million shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share for aggregate proceeds of million  net of expenses of approximately million 
the shares were issued and paid for on february  in december  hifn acquired certain assets and intellectual property valued at million  including acquisition related costs 
assets acquired include inventory  fixed assets  developed and core technology and contract backlog 
the acquired assets included in process research and development of approximately million  which was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
in september  hifn acquired certain assets and intellectual property valued at  for cash consideration of approximately million  including acquisition related costs 
assets acquired include fixed assets  core technology and workforce comprising of engineers that joined us on october  additionally  we acquired in process research and development of approximately million  which was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
in august  hifn acquired apptitude  a provider of embedded internet traffic analysis solutions  through a merger of apptitude with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of hifn 
the aggregate purchase consideration was million  consisting of million in cash and million in stock 
in exchange  we received tangible assets and assumed liabilities as well as intangible assets including developed and core technology  workforce and patents 
additionally  we acquired in process research and development which was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our product plans changed as a result of a shift in customer feature requirements and demand 
consequently  certain long lived and intangible assets associated with terminated projects were impaired and we recorded a charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that customer preferences with respect to the architecture upon which the apptitude technology would be delivered had shifted 
as a result  we significantly lowered our estimates of expected future revenues and cash flows from the apptitude technology 
the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  was less than the carrying amount of the assets associated with apptitude and an impairment charge was triggered under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
accordingly  we estimated the fair value of the apptitude assets  using the present value of estimated expected future cash flows and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  representing the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill and developed technology exceeded their fair value 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill at september  was approximately million 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  during the first quarter of fiscal  which effectively replaces sfas in accordance with sfas  the remaining carrying value of goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing 
hifn s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of proprietary and second source products sold  market acceptance of our and our customers products  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  our access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new products with higher margins  maintain our product mix between proprietary and second source products  or reduce manufacturing cost to offset decreases in the prices of our existing products  then our operating results will be adversely affected 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
since most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty  we typically plan our production and 
table of contents inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
customer demand remains highly unpredictable and variances to the forecast can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of high fixed costs in the semiconductor industry  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  material adverse fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which have in the past  and would in the future  materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and require management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from the sale of processors and software license fees 
customers comprise primarily of oems and  to a lesser extent  distributors 
revenue from the sale of processors is recognized upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  legal title and risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price is fixed or determined and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from processors sold to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return is deferred until the distributor sells the product to a third party 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the purchase price based on the company s legally enforceable right to payment 
additionally  since legal right for the inventory transfers to the distributors  inventory is relieved at the carrying value of the products shipped 
the related gross margin is recognized as a liability and recorded as deferred income 
software license revenue is generally recognized when a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
returns  including exchange rights for unsold licenses  are recorded based on agreed upon return rates or historical experience and are deferred until the return rights expire 
to the extent we experience increased levels of returns  revenue will decrease resulting in decreased gross profit 
we receive software license revenue from oems that sublicense our software shipped with their products 
the oem sublicense agreements are generally valid for a term of one year and include rights to unspecified future upgrades and maintenance during the term of the agreement 
license fees under these agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenues from sublicenses sold in excess of the specified volume in the original license agreement are recognized when they are reported as sold to end customers by the oem 
our deferred software license revenue balance as of september  was  and included approximately  in exchange rights for unsold licenses 
management judgments and estimates must be made regarding the collectibility of fees charged 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the collectibility criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out cost method or market 
inventories are comprised solely of finished goods  which are manufactured by third party foundries for resale by us 
we provide for obsolete  slow moving or excess inventories  based on forecasts prepared by management  in the period when obsolescence or inventory in excess of expected demand is first identified 
reserves are established to reduce the cost basis of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and decreased demand for semiconductor devices  in fiscal  we recorded  as a charge to cost of sales  a provision for excess inventory of million 
in fiscal years and  we recognized gross margin benefits of  and  respectively  as a result of the sale of inventories that 
table of contents had been previously written down 
as of september   inventories of million that were previously written down were still on hand 
subsequent increases in projected demand will not result in a reversal of these reserves until the sale of the related inventory 
we are subject to technological change  new product development  and product obsolescence 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we evaluate the recovery of finite lived intangible assets and other finite long lived assets  including property and equipment  acquired intangible assets and licensed intellectual property  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of our business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s product plans changed as a result of a shift in customer feature requirements and demand 
consequently  long lived and intangibles assets associated with terminated projects were impaired and a charge of million was recorded 
the impairment charge was based on the present value of management estimates of future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the impairment charge and any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with sfas  the value of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead subject to annual impairment tests or interim impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the carrying value of goodwill was approximately million at september  asset impairment charges could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
use of estimates 
we estimate uncollectible accounts receivable at each reporting period 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable  bad debt history  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  we review our accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances at each reporting period  and accrue liabilities as appropriate 
our analysis includes consideration of items such as product design and manufacturing activities  commitments made to or the level of activity with vendors  payroll and employee related costs  historic spending and anticipated changes in the cost of services 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involve estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
during fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million related to carry back of net operating losses to prior years 
during fiscal  we recorded a net tax expense of million to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
continuing losses in recent reporting periods increase the uncertainties regarding realizability of deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
litigation 
from time to time  we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
management considers such claims on a case by case basis 
we accrue for loss contingencies if both of the following conditions are met a information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated

dollars in thousands of net revenues of net revenues of net revenues change change processors    software licenses and other    net revenues increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase reflects the net effect of an increase in processor revenues of million  offset by a decrease in software license and royalties of million 
the increase in processor revenues was attributable to increases in sales of network processors of million and in sales of our data compression and encryption processor products of million  resulting from higher volume of customer purchases 
the average selling price of these processors remained at relatively the same levels 
therefore  the increase in processor revenues between the comparable periods is attributable to a combination of an increase in sales of network processors coupled with an overall increase in volume 
the decrease in revenues from software license and royalties resulted from the variability in demand for and timing of customers purchase of certain of the company s licensed software products 
net revenues increased by million in fiscal as compared to net revenues in fiscal the increase in net revenues reflects an increase in sales of data compression and encryption processors of million coupled with incremental revenues of million generated from the sale of network processors related to the

cost of processor revenues as a percentage of net processor revenues increased two percentage points for fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal the company s product offerings in fiscal included a higher proportion of network processors  which carry a higher cost  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  as compared to all other processors 
as a result  processor cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased 
cost of processor revenues as a percentage of net processor revenues decreased four percentage points for fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal as a result of the mix of processor products sold during the respective periods 
additionally  because allocated cost of revenues overhead cost remained at relatively the same level in both and  greater revenues in fiscal meant an overall decrease in cost as a percentage of revenues for fiscal during fiscal  and  we sold  and  and  respectively  in inventories that had previously been written down 
cost of software licenses and other revenues is primarily comprised of engineering labor related to support and maintenance of sold licenses 
the increasing trend in such costs  in absolute dollars  is attributable to the increase in both the labor rates and the number of full time equivalent staff allocated to provide support and maintenance 
the fluctuation in software licenses and other costs as a percentage of software licenses and other revenues is dependent upon the mix of licensed software and royalties earned during the period

dollars in thousands change change research development expenses    as a percentage of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  overhead  outside contractors and non recurring engineering fees 
such research and development expenses decreased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is attributable to decreases of  in non recurring engineering costs associated with tape out  mask activities and qualification testing of products under development  
table of contents  in engineering and consulting services which reflects the net effect of a reduction of  in consulting fees related to the transition and transfer of the technical designs of the ibm network processors and  in other services as outsourced projects were completed  offset by an increase of  in engineering services for milestone deliveries related to the pattern matching technology development   in software tools and maintenance expense  which is a result of the consolidation of certain software tools and maintenance arrangements coupled with the termination of any such arrangements related to completed projects 
these decreases were offset by an increase of  in salaries and benefits expense mainly as a result of a combination of higher average salary rates and twenty three additional engineers during fiscal research and development expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and mainly reflects an increase in consulting costs of million  which is comprised of  in transition services costs related to the transfer of the technical designs of the ibm network processors   in samples testing and new product development and  in costs related to the establishment of a network security laboratory in china 
additionally  salaries and benefits expense increased  including accrued severance costs of  related to a reduction in force in june  and fourteen additional engineers during the period 
adding further to the increase was the purchase of low value engineering equipment for headcount additions and software tools aggregating  and an increase in engineering materials expense of  as a result of the timing of product testing and development

cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal resulting from net loss during the period of million  adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of intangibles related to acquired technologies of million and the net change in assets and liabilities comprised of a decrease in accounts receivable of  reflecting lower revenue levels during the last month of fiscal as compared to the last month of fiscal  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  due to reductions in prepaid rent resulting from the overall decrease in facility square footage and monthly rental cost and in prepaid maintenance and licenses resulting from the non renewal of license and maintenance arrangements related to completed projects and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  reflecting the net effect of an increase in deferred income and revenues  which relate to the timing of customer purchases of license and maintenance contracts amortizable over the service or license term and distributor sell through of purchased processors  offset by a reduction in accrued vacant facility lease cost in accordance with scheduled amortization 
contributing to cash used in operations was an increase in inventories of  an increase in other assets of  related to licensed technologies for integration into products under development and a decrease in accounts payable of million as a result of the timing of purchases of inventory and software maintenance tools 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million and was the result of net loss of million  adjusted for non cash items including purchased in process research and development of million  depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of intangibles related to acquired technologies of million  which includes million in amortization of the acquired backlog and technology related to the ibm network processor product line  amortization of deferred stock compensation of  and loss on disposal of leasehold improvements of  related to an expired lease  as well as an increase in accounts payable of million attributable to purchases of inventory  corresponding with increased revenues 
these adjustments were offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million as a result of increased revenues 
also contributing to net cash used in operating activities was an increase in other assets of  related to licensed technologies for integration into products under development and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million as a result of a reduction in deferred revenues and accrued non recurring engineering costs 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities of approximately million was comprised of net loss as adjusted for non cash items including provision for the impairment of intangibles of million  amortization of intangibles and of deferred stock compensation of million  depreciation and amortization costs of million and decreases in prepaids and other current assets of million  in inventories of  and an increase in accounts payable of  these adjustments were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  and in other assets of  and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal of million reflects the net sale of short term investments of million as the company shifted its portfolio mix from government agency obligations to higher yielding instruments like corporate obligations and commercial paper as interest rates were increasing  and the purchase of property and equipment of million for office and computer equipment 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million reflects the purchase of certain assets and intellectual property for million  including million related to the ibm network processor product line and million related to the purchase of pattern matching technology  the net purchase of short term investments of 
table of contents million utilizing the proceeds from the private placement financing and the purchase of property and equipment of  cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  resulting from the net purchase of short term investments of  and the acquisition of million in property and equipment 
the company anticipates its property and equipment purchases in fiscal year will approximate those in the preceding three years 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million and was the result of the repurchase of approximately  of our outstanding common stock for million and installment payments on acquired software licenses of  offset by cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases which aggregated million 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million and was comprised of net proceeds from the private placement financing of million  cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases which aggregated million offset by installment payments on acquired software licenses of  on february   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors for the private placement of million shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share for aggregate proceeds of million  net of expenses of approximately million 
the net proceeds are being used for working capital and general corporate purposes  and may be used for strategic purposes in connection with selected acquisitions that may be considered in the future to expand its product and service offerings 
the shares were issued and paid for on february  cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of  reflects proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases of million offset by installment payments on acquired software licenses of the company s inventory balance at september  reflected an increase of  as compared to the balance as of september  the increase in inventory was a result of the timing of inventory purchases relative to manufacturer lead time coupled with anticipated shipment schedules to fill customer orders for the succeeding quarter 
the company s inventory turns for the year ended september  were times as compared to times for the year ended september  the company s accounts receivable balance  which is contingent upon the timing of product shipment within the respective periods  decreased  to million  as of september   reflecting lower customer purchase levels and revenues in september as compared to september the company uses a number of independent suppliers to manufacture substantially all of its products 
as a result  the company relies on these suppliers to allocate to the company a sufficient portion of foundry capacity to meet the company s needs and deliver sufficient quantities of the company s products on a timely basis 
these arrangements allow the company to avoid utilizing its capital resources for manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory and to focus substantially all of its resources on the design  development and marketing of its products 
the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable and inventory  and for investments in property and equipment 
the company s need to raise capital in the future will depend on many factors including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of the company s existing and new products  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing and size of acquisitions of businesses or technologies  the timing of the introduction of new products and the expansion of sales and marketing efforts 
we believe that our existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional capital expenditures  the level of our product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
common stock repurchase 
on april   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby the company may repurchase shares of the company s common stock with an aggregate fair market value of up to million from time to time through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices determined by management 
the timing and amount of repurchases under the program depends upon market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations

in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  agreements that we have determined to be within the scope of fin include hardware and software license warranties  indemnification arrangements with officers and directors and indemnification arrangements with customers with respect to intellectual property 
to date  the company has not incurred material costs in relation to any of the above guarantees and  accordingly  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as permitted under delaware law  the company has agreements that provide indemnification of officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at the company s request in such capacity 
the indemnification period is effective for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  the company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables the company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
all of the indemnification agreements were grandfathered under the provisions of fin as they were in effect prior to december  as a result of the insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of the potential liability under these agreements is minimal

trends  risks and uncertainties in future periods  hifn s business  financial condition and results of operations may be affected by many factors including  but not limited to  the following our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market 
our prospects are dependent upon the acceptance of packet processors as an alternative to other technology traditionally utilized by network and storage equipment vendors 
many of our current and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources and currently develop internally the application specific integrated circuit components and program the general purpose microprocessors utilized in their products as an alternative to our packet processors 
these customers may in the future continue to rely on these solutions or may determine to develop or acquire components  technologies or packet processors that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
in order to be successful  we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of such network and storage equipment vendors and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet their requirements 
in addition  we must make products available to these large customers on a timely basis and at competitive prices 
if orders from customers are cancelled  decreased or delayed  or if we fail to obtain significant orders from new customers  or any significant customer delays or fails to pay  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the continued growth of the network equipment and storage equipment markets and our penetration of the virtual private network  iscsi and network processor markets 
our success is largely dependent upon continued growth in the market for network security equipment  such as routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment  security gateways  firewalls and network interface cards 
our success also depends upon storage equipment vendors incorporating our packet processors into their systems 
we want to be a leading supplier of packet processors that implement the network security protocols necessary to support the deployment of virtual private networks 
additionally  we have entered into the network processor market and developed products that we anticipate fulfills the need for security in the iscsi market 
these markets  which are either emerging or evolving  may not grow or be material 
alternatively  if they do emerge or continue to grow  our products may not successfully serve this market 
our ability to generate significant revenue in the network and storage equipment  virtual private network  network processor and iscsi markets will depend upon  among other things  the following capital spending levels  
table of contents additions to  changes in or lack of industry standards  our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our technology to distributors  original equipment manufacturers and end users  the increased use of the internet by businesses as replacements for  or enhancements to  their private networks  and the adoption of security as a necessary feature in iscsi 
we are unable to determine the rate or extent to which the network equipment and storage markets will grow  if at all 
additionally  if we are unable to penetrate the virtual private network  network processor or iscsi markets  or if these markets may fail to develop  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
any decrease in the growth of the network or storage equipment market  a decline in demand for our products or our inability to penetrate new markets could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we depend upon a small number of customers  if our sales to any of these customers decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer

semiconductor sales to quantum corporation  through its manufacturing subcontractor  represented  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
semiconductor sales to huawei technologies  inc  an oem producer of networking equipment  represented and of our net revenues for fiscal year ended september  and  respectively 
cisco  quantum and huawei are not under any binding obligation to order from us 
a decline in our sales to cisco  quantum or huawei decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
during the three months ended september   sales to huawei and cisco decreased and  respectively  over revenues generated from each respective customer in the preceding quarter  significantly affecting the company s revenue levels and results of operations for the quarter 
it is possible that our most significant customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today for a number of reasons  including customers deployment schedules and budget considerations 
as a result  we believe we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis 
limited numbers of network and storage equipment vendors account for a majority of packet processor purchases in their respective markets 
in particular  the market for network equipment that would include packet processors  such as routers  remote access concentrators and firewalls  is dominated by a few large vendors  including cisco  nortel networks  inc and com corporation 
as a result  our future success will depend upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with these companies 
if these network equipment vendors do not incorporate our packet processors into their products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors including the following general business conditions in our markets as well as global economic uncertainty  increases or reductions in demand for our customers products  the timing and volume of orders we receive from our customers  
table of contents cancellations or delays of customer product orders  acquisitions or mergers involving us  our competitors or customers  any new product introductions by us or our competitors  our suppliers increasing costs or changing the delivery of products to us  increased competition or reductions in the prices that we are able to charge  the variety of the products that we sell as well as seasonal demand for our products  and the availability of manufacturing capacity necessary to make our products 
the length of time it takes to develop our products and make a sale to our customers may impair our operating results 
our customers typically take a long time to evaluate our products 
in fact  it usually takes our customers to months or more to test our products with an additional to months or more before they commence significant production of equipment incorporating our products 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts on the one hand  and the generation of higher revenues  if any  on the other hand 
in addition  the delays inherent in such a lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in the loss of anticipated sales 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer if customers reduce or delay orders or choose not to release products using our technology 
we depend upon independent manufacturers and limited sources of supply 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and test our packet processors 
we currently subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  toshiba corporation  philips semiconductor and ibm 
since we depend upon independent manufacturers  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
none of our products are manufactured by more than one supplier 
since the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  foundry capacity has been very limited at times in the past and may become limited in the future 
we depend on our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of finished product to us in a timely manner 
since we place orders on a purchase order basis and do not have long term volume purchase agreements with any of our suppliers  our suppliers may allocate production capacity to their other customers products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
in the past  one of our suppliers delayed the delivery of one of our products 
as a result  we switched production of the product to a new manufacturer that caused a month delay in shipments to our customers 
we have also experienced yield and test anomalies on a different product manufactured by another subcontractor that could have interrupted our customer shipments 
in this case  the manufacturer was able to correct the problem in a timely manner and customer shipments were not affected 
the delay and expense associated with qualifying a new supplier or foundry and commencing volume production can result in lost revenue  reduced operating margins and possible harm to customer relationships 
the steps required for a new manufacturer to begin production of a semiconductor product include adapting our product design  if necessary  to the new manufacturer s process  creating a new mask set to manufacture the product  having the new manufacturer prepare sample products so we can verify the product specification  and providing sample products to customers for qualification 

table of contents in general  it takes from to months for a new manufacturer to begin full scale production of one of our products 
we could have similar or more protracted problems in the future with existing or new suppliers 
toshiba corporation manufactures products for us in plants located in asia 
to date  the financial and stock market dislocations that have occurred in the asian financial markets in the past have not harmed our business 
however  present or future dislocations or other international business risks  such as currency exchange fluctuations or recessions  could force us to seek new suppliers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  and could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
in addition  if global semiconductor manufacturing capacity fails to increase in line with demand  foundries could allocate available capacity to larger customers or customers with long term supply contracts 
if we cannot obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or our supply is interrupted or delayed  our product revenues could decrease or our cost of revenues could increase 
this could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we regularly consider using smaller semiconductor dimensions for each of our products in order to reduce costs 
we have begun to decrease the dimensions in our new product designs  and believe that we must do so to remain competitive 
we may have difficulty decreasing the dimensions of our products 
in the future  we may change our supply arrangements to assume more product manufacturing responsibilities 
we may subcontract for wafer manufacturing  assembly and test rather than purchase finished products 
however  there are additional risks associated with manufacturing  including variances in production yields  the ability to obtain adequate test and assembly capacity at reasonable cost and other general risks associated with the manufacture of semiconductors 
we may also enter into volume purchase agreements that would require us to commit to minimum levels of purchases and which may require up front investments 
if we fail to effectively assume greater manufacturing responsibilities or manage volume purchase arrangements  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we face risks associated with acquisitions 
we continually evaluate strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies that would complement our product offerings or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
future acquisitions could be effected without stockholder approval  and could cause us to dilute shareholder equity  incur debt and contingent liabilities and amortize acquisition expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could harm our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we acquire 
if we fail to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we face risks associated with the integration of the ibm network processor product line into our business 
on december   we acquired certain assets and intellectual property related to the ibm network processor product line 
prior to our acquisition of these assets  we understand ibm informed its customers that it was discontinuing selected research and development activities in connection with the assets and would not be developing any related follow on products with respect to the products associated with the acquired assets 
while the company has  to date  been able to retain the customer in existence for the network processors as of the time of the acquisition  there can be no assurance that the established customer base will continue to purchase the products based on the acquired assets from us or maintain their relationship with us in the future for follow on products 
if we fail to maintain the established customer base  we may not be able to maintain the revenue and profit performance 
table of contents levels that ibm established with respect to these products 
loss of the established customer base could negatively impact our results of operations  business and financial condition 
additionally  our success in integrating the acquired assets and intellectual property into our business depends upon our ability to merge the acquired assets into our ongoing and future operations  including maintaining a continuing relationship with ibm s established customer base and our third party supplier  in this case  ibm 
without the successful integration of this significant asset acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the revenue and profit performance levels we have experienced thus far with the existing network processors 
if we fail to integrate the follow on products into our operations successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we face order and shipment uncertainties  which makes it difficult to forecast future revenues accurately and may cause us to hold too much inventory 
we generally make our sales under individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty  if any 
cancellation or deferral of product orders could cause us to hold excess inventory  which  by increasing our costs without a commensurate increase in revenue  could harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
such variability in customer demand coupled with customers ability to cancel orders on short notice also makes it more difficult to forecast future revenue 
during fiscal  we wrote off excess inventory of million as a result of a significant decrease in forecasted demand for our products 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers 
revenue from products sold to distributors is deferred until the distributor sells the products to a third party 
an unanticipated level of returns could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards 
our performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to do the following properly identify emerging target markets and related technological trends  develop and maintain competitive products  develop end to end  ubiquitous systems solutions  develop  or partner with providers of  security services processors  develop both hardware and software security services solutions  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
our past success has been dependent in part upon our ability to develop products that have been selected for design into new products of leading equipment manufacturers 
however  the development of our packet processors is complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
we may not be able to adhere to our new product design and introduction schedules and our products may not be accepted in the market at favorable prices  if at all 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  competitive product offerings 
table of contents and industry standards 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are complicated and require a significant amount of time and money 
during fiscal  we acquired certain technology for embedded processors  pattern matching and network processors 
we may experience substantial difficulty in introducing new products  such as new products containing the acquired technologies and we may be unable to offer enhancements to existing products on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
for instance  the performance of our encryption compression and public key processors depends upon the integrity of our security technology 
if any significant advances in overcoming cryptographic systems are made  then the security of our encryption compression and public key processors will be reduced or eliminated unless we are able to develop further technical innovations that adequately enhance the security of these products 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and are expected to become increasingly competitive as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
the markets that we compete in are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
our products compete with offerings from companies such as safenet  inc  broadcom corporation  cavium networks  freescale technologies  inc  intel corporation  agere systems and applied micro circuits corporation 
hifn was a wholly owned subsidiary of stac  inc until hifn s spin off from stac in upon which stac assigned two license agreements entered into with ibm in in which stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also assigned to us its license agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft in whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered  or expressed an interest to enter  the network equipment market 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential customers internally develop solutions which attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
a key element of our packet processor architecture is our encryption technology 
until recently  in order to export our encryption related products  the us department of commerce required us to obtain a license 
foreign competitors that were not subject to similar requirements have an advantage over us in their ability to establish existing markets for their products and rapidly respond to the requests of customers in the global market 
although the export restriction has been liberalized  we may not be successful in entering or competing in the foreign encryption markets 
see our products are subject to export restrictions 
many of our current and prospective competitors offer broader product lines and have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to promote the sale of their products 
in particular  companies such as intel corporation  lucent technologies inc  motorola  inc  national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated have a significant advantage over us given their relationships with many of our customers  their extensive marketing power and name recognition and their much greater financial resources 
in addition  current and potential competitors may decide to consolidate  lower the prices of their products or bundle their products with other products 
any of the above would significantly and negatively impact our ability to compete and obtain or maintain market share 
if we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors  our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we believe that the important competitive factors in our markets are the following performance  price  
table of contents the time that is required to develop a new product or enhancements to existing products  the ability to achieve product acceptance with major network and storage equipment vendors  the support that exists for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  and technical service and support as well as effective intellectual property protection 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market products that compete with those of other suppliers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms  these distributors and sales representatives may decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
our success depends upon protecting our intellectual property 
our proprietary technology is critical to our future success 
we rely in part on patent  trade  trademark  mask work and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
we own twenty four united states patents and eight foreign patents 
our issued patents and patent applications primarily cover various aspects of our compression  flow classification  bandwidth management  cryptographic packet processing  rate shaping and pattern matching technologies and have expiration dates ranging from to we also have three pending patent applications in the united states and a total of fifteen in europe  asia and australia covering flow classification  cryptographic packet processing  and pattern matching 
patents may not be issued under our current or future patent applications  and the patents issued under such patent applications could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  third parties could make infringement claims against us in the future 
such infringement claims could result in costly litigation 
we may not prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
regardless of the outcome  an infringement claim would likely result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the patents issued to us may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  others could develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
however  our efforts may not be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
network and storage equipment prices typically decrease 
average selling prices in the networking  storage and semiconductor industries have rapidly declined due to many factors  including rapidly changing technologies  
table of contents price performance enhancements  and product obsolescence 
the decline in the average selling prices of our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future due to product introductions by our competitors  price pressures from significant customers and other factors 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features which we can sell at higher prices 
if we fail to do so  our revenues and gross margins could decline  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face product return  product liability and product defect risks 
complex products such as ours frequently contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have discovered such errors  defects and bugs in the past 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could hinder market acceptance of our products 
this could damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
errors  defects or bugs could also cause interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
we would have to expend significant capital and resources to remedy these problems 
errors  defects or bugs could be discovered in our new products after we begin commercial production of them  despite testing by us and our suppliers and customers 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon key personnel 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our key management and other personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel  nor do we maintain any key man life insurance on any of our personnel 
we have recently entered into severance and change of control agreements with our executive and other officers  however  there can be no assurance that such personnel will necessarily remain with the company 
it may be difficult for us to integrate new members of our management team 
we must also attract and retain experienced and highly skilled engineering  sales and marketing and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel has  in the past  been intense in the geographic areas and market segments in which we compete  and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining such people 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  or cannot attract or retain qualified personnel  particularly engineers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  companies in technology industries whose employees accept positions with competitors have in the past claimed that their competitors have engaged in unfair competition or hiring practices 
we could receive such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
these claims could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against any such claims  regardless of their merits 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may harm our business 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this has caused significant variances in product demand  production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices 
industry wide fluctuations in the future could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with our international business activities 
we sell most of our products to customers in the united states 
if our international sales increase  particularly in light of decreased export restrictions  we may encounter risks inherent in international operations 
all of our international sales to date are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies  our products could become less competitive in international markets 
we also obtain 
table of contents some of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states 
international business activities could be limited or disrupted by any of the following the imposition of governmental controls  export license technical review requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  currency exchange fluctuations  political instability  financial and stock market dislocations  military and related activities  trade restrictions  and changes in tariffs 
demand for our products also could be harmed by seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets 
these international factors could harm future sales of our products to international customers and our business  financial condition and results of operations in general 
the company has established a development facility in china 
the facility faces some of the same risks with respect to international business activities as referenced above  including  without limitation  the imposition of governmental controls  currency exchange fluctuations and political instability 
our products are subject to export restrictions 
the encryption algorithms embedded in our products are a key element of our packet processor architecture 
these products are subject to us department of commerce export control restrictions 
our network equipment customers may only export products incorporating encryption technology if they obtain a one time technical review 
these us export laws also prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of countries deemed by the us to be hostile 
many foreign countries also restrict exports to many of these countries deemed to be terrorist supporting states by the us government 
because the restrictions on exports of encryption products have been liberalized  we  along with our network equipment customers have an opportunity to effectively compete with our foreign competitors 
the existence of these restrictions until recently may have enabled foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products to become more established and  therefore  more competitive in the global market than our network equipment customers 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised  and laws limiting the domestic use of encryption could be enacted 
while the us government now allows us companies to assume that exports to non government end users will be approved within days of official registration with the department of commerce  the sale of our packet processors could be harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required approvals or by the costs of compliance 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology related companies including networking  storage and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
such fluctuations can result from quarterly variations in operating results  
table of contents announcements of new products by us or our competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in analysts estimates  short selling of our common stock  and events affecting other companies that investors deem to be comparable to us 
the common stock sold in our private offering increased  while the common stock purchased under our repurchase program decreased  the supply of our common stock on the public market  which may cause our stock price to decline 
on april   the registration statement on form s relating to the sale of  shares of our common stock in a private equity offering on february  was declared effective 
the shares of common stock becoming eligible for immediate and unrestricted resale into the public market at any time could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the presence of these additional shares of common stock in the public market may further depress our stock price 
on april   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase shares of the company s common stock with an aggregate fair market value of up to million from time to time through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices determined by management 
the timing and amount of repurchases under this program is dependent upon market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
the stock repurchase program expires on april  in fiscal year  the company repurchased a total of  shares under the program  which shares have been held in treasury stock  at a cost of million 
the increase or decrease in our levels of repurchase could affect the market price of our common stock 
if we determine that our long lived assets have been impaired or that our goodwill has been further impaired our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we perform impairment analyses of goodwill and long lived and intangible assets on an annual basis 
during fiscal and  we determined that impairment had been realized on certain developed technology and goodwill  resulting in recognition of impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
pursuant to sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we will continue to perform an annual impairment test and if  as a result of this analysis  we determine that there has been an impairment of our goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets  asset impairment charges will be recognized 
approximately million of goodwill remains as of september  if we determine that our long lived assets have been impaired or that our goodwill has been further impaired  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  as part of a broader attempt to eliminate differences with the international accounting standards board  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting changes  and fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
apb had required that changes in accounting principles be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change in the period in which the new accounting principle was adopted 
sfas requires retrospective application of the change to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of the change 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset 
table of contents retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  an amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and statement on financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
the revised standard addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the effective date for sfas r  as amended on april   is for annual periods beginning after june  and will be implemented by the company in the first quarter of fiscal the company will recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method 
currently  we disclose the pro forma net income loss and related pro forma income loss per share information in accordance with sfas and statement on financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation costs transition and disclosure 
the adoption of sfas r will have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations of the company  although it will have no impact on the overall financial position 
the precise impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r using the modified retrospective application for all prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described under the accounting for stock based compensation section in note sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were zero for all periods presented 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance on the implementation of sfas r share based payment see discussion below 
in particular  sab provides key guidance related to valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas r  the modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of sfas r  the classification of compensation expense  capitalization of compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  first time adoption of sfas r in an interim period  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
the company will apply the principles of sab in conjuntion with its adoption of sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas will be effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas will be effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which focuses on safety and principal preservation of our invested funds 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of commercial paper and municipal bonds 
we place investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of september  would have an immaterial effect on our pre tax earnings and the carrying value of our investments over the next fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rate risk all of our sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not incurred gains and losses from such fluctuations
