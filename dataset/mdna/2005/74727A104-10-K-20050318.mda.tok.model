item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the twelve months ended december   and and the six months ended december  and  and financial condition at december   december   and december  in  the company changed its fiscal year end from june to december due to this change  the company filed for the transition period from july  to december  throughout this document  reference to fiscal  fiscal  the transition period  and fiscal are for the years ended december  and  the six months ended december   and the year ended june  this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview the company was formed in february for the purpose of organizing quad city bank trust and has grown to million in consolidated assets as of december  management expects continued opportunities for growth through our three bank charters  although the rate of growth may not be maintained at that experienced to date 
the company reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million or basic earnings per share for fiscal  million or basic earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   million or basic earnings per share for the six month transition period ended december   and million or basic earnings per share for fiscal earnings for were positively impacted by the company s continued merchant credit card processing through september for an iso portfolio  which had been sold in october this iso processing contributed thousand  or in diluted earnings per share  to the company s net income during also  in february  the company issued million in floating rate and million in fixed floating rate trust preferred securities 
in connection with this issuance  the company redeemed  on june   million of trust preferred securities originally issued in prior to this redemption  the company had expensed thousand of unamortized issuance costs associated with the trust preferred securities in march the write off of these costs  combined with the additional interest costs of supporting both the original and the new securities from february through june  resulted in an after tax reduction to net income during of thousand  or in diluted earnings per share 
excluding the one time write off of these unamortized issuance costs and the additional interest costs incurred for approximately four months  net income for would have been million  or diluted earnings per share of  a improvement over earnings for although excluding the impact of this event is a non gaap measure  management believes that it is important to provide such information due to the non recurring nature of this expense and to more accurately compare the results of the periods presented 
when compared to the same period in  the fiscal year ended december  reflected significant growth in both net interest income and earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance for the company 
for fiscal  net interest income and earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance improved by and  respectively  for a combined increase of million when compared to the twelve months ended december  a decrease in the provision for loan losses of million from fiscal to fiscal also contributed positively to net income 
the successful resolution of several large credits in quad city bank trust s loan portfolio  through foreclosure  payoff  or restructuring  resulted in reductions to both provision expense and the level of allowance for loan losses 
trust department fees and investment advisory and management fees also contributed an additional thousand  in aggregate  to the company s noninterest income 
partially offsetting these revenue contributions for the company was an increase in noninterest expense of million 
the primary contributors to the increase in noninterest expense were salaries and employee benefits  which increased million from the same period in and the thousand loss on the redemption of junior subordinated debentures 
also during fiscal  the company incurred thousand of pretax costs associated with the start up of the new banking operation in rockford  illinois 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to the net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreased for fiscal as compared to with the same comparison  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased  which resulted in a decrease in the net interest spread of at december  compared to at december  the relative stability in the net interest spread from year to year did not carry over to the net interest margin 
for fiscal  net interest margin was compared to for management continues to closely monitor and manage net interest margin 
from a profitability standpoint  an important challenge for the subsidiary banks is the maintenance of their net interest margins 
management continually addresses this issue with the use of alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
the company s operating results are also affected by sources of noninterest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of the company include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
the company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the company has continued to add facilities and employees to accommodate both our historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
this trend is likely to continue as our three banks continue to add the facilities and resources necessary to attract and serve additional customers 
during  quad city bank trust began to develop internally a merchant credit card processing operation and in transferred this function to bancard  a separate subsidiary of the company 
bancard initially had an arrangement to provide processing services exclusively to merchants of a single independent sales organization or iso 
this iso was sold in  and the purchaser requested a reduction in the term of the contract 
bancard agreed to amend the contract to reduce the term and accept a fixed monthly processing fee of thousand for merchants existing at the time the agreement was signed  and a lower transaction fee for new merchants  in exchange for a payment of million  the ability to transact business with other isos and the assumption of the credit risk by the iso 
approximately two thirds of the income from this settlement  or million  was reported in fiscal  with the remainder of thousand being recognized during fiscal bancard terminated its processing for this iso in may  eliminating approximately of its average monthly processing volume 
prior to this iso s termination  bancard s average monthly processing volume for fiscal was million 
during both fiscal and  bancard worked to establish additional iso relationships and further develop the relationships with existing isos successfully rebuilding and expanding processing volumes 
bancard s average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed during fiscal was million 
during fiscal  the average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed by bancard increased to million 
monthly processing volumes at bancard during fiscal climbed to a level above that existing prior to the termination of all processing with the initial iso 
on october   the company announced bancard s sale of its iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc for million 
after contractual compensation and severance payments  transaction expenses  and income taxes  the transaction resulted in a net gain of million  or per share  which was realized during the quarter ended december  also included in the sale were all of the merchant credit card processing relationships owned by bancard s subsidiary  allied merchant services  inc bancard has continued to provide credit card processing for its local merchants and cardholders of the subsidiary banks and agent banks 
the company anticipated that the termination of the iso related merchant credit card processing would reduce bancard s future earnings 
bancard continued to process transactions for ipayment  inc through september as anticipated  the reduced processing volumes that bancard experienced during the fourth quarter of resulted in a decline in quarterly merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs for the company 
the fourth quarter of generated thousand of merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs  as compared to thousand for the third quarter of despite this decline in processing volumes and fees and the resulting reduction in operating results from prior quarters  bancard has remained profitable with its narrowed business focus of providing credit card processing for its local merchants and agent banks and for cardholders of the company s subsidiary banks 
during fiscal  quad city bank trust expanded its presence in the mortgage banking market by hiring several experienced loan originators and an experienced underwriter  and currently the company has ten loan originators on staff 
our banks originate mortgage loans on personal residences and sell the majority of these loans into the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate financing 
the subsidiary banks realize revenue from this mortgage banking activity from a combination of loan origination fees and gains on the sale of the loans in the secondary market 
during the twelve months ended december   the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
during the twelve months ended december   the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
during the six months ended december   the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
the depressed interest rates throughout calendar and most of calendar brought significant increases in the subsidiary banks mortgage origination volumes during those periods 
the rising rate environment experienced in resulted in an abrupt decline in mortgage loan originations 
trust department income continues to be a significant contributor to noninterest income 
trust department fees contributed million in revenues during fiscal during fiscal  trust department fees totaled million 
in the six months ended december   trust department fees contributed million in revenues 
trust department fees were million in fiscal income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
assets under administration at december  increased to million  resulting primarily from the development of existing relationships and the addition of new trust relationships 
at december   assets under administration were million  which was an increase of million from december   when assets totaled million 
the company s initial public offering during the fourth calendar quarter of raised approximately million 
in order to provide additional capital to support the growth of quad city bank trust  the company formed a statutory business trust in june  which issued million of capital securities to the public for cash 
these securities were redeemed at their earliest call date on june  in conjunction with the formation of cedar rapids bank trust  the company sold approximately million of its common stock through a private placement offering in september  primarily to investors in the cedar rapids area 
in february  the company formed two additional trusts  which  in a private transaction  issued million of floating rate capital securities and million of fixed floating rate capital securities 
the company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the redemption  in june  of the million of capital securities issued in in conjunction with the formation of rockford bank trust  the company sold approximately million of its common stock through a private placement offering in december  primarily to investors in the rockford area 
critical accounting policy the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  management has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  governmental guarantees  payment status  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s markets  including economic conditions throughout the midwest and in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure  existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology 
as the company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio  it enhances its methodology accordingly 
management may report a materially different amount for the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations to change the allowance for loan losses if its assessment of the above factors were different 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein  as well as the portion of this management s discussion and analysis section entitled financial condition allowance for loan losses 
although management believes the levels of the allowance as of december    and were adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  or other factors  could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal overview 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to net income of million for the twelve month period ended december  for a decrease of thousand or 
basic earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to for the decrease in net income was comprised of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million in combination with a decrease in federal and state income taxes of thousand  totally offset by a decrease in noninterest income of million  and an increase in noninterest expenses of million 
several specific factors contributed to the decline in net income from fiscal to fiscal primary factors included a million  or  decrease in gains on sale of loans  a million  or  increase in salaries and employee benefits  a decrease in merchant credit card fees of  or thousand  and the loss on redemption of junior subordinated debentures of thousand 
interest income 
interest income grew from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest earning assets  principally loans receivable  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 
the average yield on interest earning assets for the twelve months ended december  was as compared to for the twelve month period ended december  interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest bearing liabilities  which was partially offset by a reduction in interest rates 
the average cost on interest bearing liabilities was for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the like period in provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is established based on a number of factors  including the local and national economy and the risk associated with the loans in the portfolio 
the company had an allowance for estimated losses on loans of approximately of total gross loans at december   as compared to approximately at december   at december   and at june  the provision for loan losses declined significantly to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal during both periods  management made monthly provisions for loan losses based upon a number of factors  principally the increase in loans and a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
during fiscal  the successful resolution of several large credits in quad city bank trust s loan portfolio  through foreclosure  payoff  or restructuring  resulted in reductions to both provision expense and the level of allowance for loan losses 
during fiscal  the net growth in the loan portfolio actually generated provision expense of million  however  or thousand  was offset by adjustments to the allowance for estimated losses on loans based on the write offs  payoffs  or restructures of several large credits within the portfolio 
during  there were transfers totaling million of loans to other real estate owned 
for fiscal  commercial loans had total charge offs of thousand  of which thousand resulted from two customer relationships at quad city bank trust  and there were thousand of commercial recoveries 
consumer loan charge offs and recoveries totaled thousand and thousand  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  for fiscal  credit cards accounted for thousand of the consumer loan charge offs 
real estate loans had thousand of charge offs and no recovery activity during fiscal the ability to grow profitably is  in part  dependent upon the ability to maintain asset quality 
the company continually focuses its efforts at the subsidiary banks to attempt to improve the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased by million from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal noninterest income for both periods  along with other miscellaneous fees  consisted primarily of income from the merchant credit card operation  fees from the trust department  depository service fees  and gains on the sale of residential real estate mortgage loans 
making significant improvements from year to year in the noninterest income category were increases in earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance and trust department fees 
merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs for fiscal decreased by to million from million for fiscal in october  the company sold bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc  and bancard s core business focus was shifted to processing for its agent banks  cardholders  and local merchants 
through september  bancard continued to process iso related transactions for ipayment  inc for a fixed monthly service fee  which increased as the temporary processing period was extended 
for fiscal  net fixed monthly service fees collected from ipayment totaled thousand  and bancard s core merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs were million 
in september  the transfer of the iso related visa mastercard processing activity to ipayment  inc was completed and significantly reduced bancard s exposure to risk of credit card loss that the iso activity carried with it 
bancard had established and carried iso specific reserves  which provided coverage for this exposure 
in march  the company recognized a recovery of thousand from a reduction in these iso specific reserves 
in september  the company also recognized a recovery of thousand from the elimination of the remaining balance in the iso specific reserves 
less these recoveries and an additional thousand of service fees collected from ipayment  bancard s core merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs were million for fiscal  or a decrease of from the previous year 
the thousand decrease in core merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs from year to year was primarily due to provisions for merchant chargeback losses of thousand made during fiscal  which were the result of two merchant situations involving fraudulent activity 
in fiscal  trust department fees grew to million from million in fiscal the thousand  or  increase from year to year was primarily a reflection of continued development of existing trust relationships and the addition of new trust customers  as well as an improvement in the market values of securities held in trust accounts  when compared to one year ago 
each of these factors had a resulting impact in the calculation and realization of trust fees 
total trust assets under management were million at december  compared to million at december  deposit service fees increased thousand  or  to million from million for fiscal and for fiscal  respectively 
this increase was primarily a result of the growth in service fees collected on the noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts of downstream correspondent banks of quad city bank trust  in combination with the growth in service fees collected on demand accounts at cedar rapids bank trust 
service charges and nsf non sufficient funds or overdraft charges related to demand deposit accounts were the main components of deposit service fees 
gains on sales of loans  net  were million for fiscal  which reflected a decrease of  or million  from million for fiscal the decrease resulted from the steep decline in mortgage refinances  which was experienced throughout  and its effect on the subsequent sale of the majority of residential mortgages into the secondary market 
management anticipates that the level of gains on sales of loans  net  will continue to be reduced significantly from those experienced throughout much of during fiscal  earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance grew thousand  or  to thousand from thousand for fiscal during the first quarter of  the company made significant investments in bank owned life insurance boli on key executives at the two existing subsidiary banks 
quad city bank trust purchased million of boli  and cedar rapids bank trust made a purchase of million of boli 
investment advisory and management fees increased thousand from thousand for fiscal to thousand for fiscal the increase from year to year was due to the increased volume of investment services provided by representatives of lpl financial services at the subsidiary banks  primarily at cedar rapids bank trust 
for the twelve months ended december   other noninterest income decreased thousand  or  to thousand from million for the same period in the decrease  in  was primarily due to a combination of decreased income from non consolidated subsidiaries of the company and from a gain realized during on the sale of foreclosed property at quad city bank trust 
noninterest expenses 
for both fiscal and fiscal  the main components of noninterest expenses were primarily salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and professional and data processing fees 
noninterest expenses for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal for an increase of million  or 
the following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest expenses for fiscal years and twelve months ended december  change salaries and employee benefits   professional and data processing fees   advertising and marketing   occupancy and equipment expense   stationery and supplies   postage and telephone   bank service charges   insurance   loss on redemption of junior subordinated debentures  na other   total noninterest expenses   for fiscal  total salaries and benefits  the largest component of noninterest expenses  increased to million or million over the million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the company s increase in employees from full time equivalents to from year to year  in combination with decreased expenses for both real estate loan officer commissions and for tax benefit rights and stock appreciation rights 
the growth in personnel during mirrored a combination of quad city bank trust s expansion into the rockford market and the strong growth occurring at cedar rapids bank trust 
fiscal reflected a thousand loss on the redemption of the trust preferred securities issued in at their earliest call date of june  occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand  or 
the increase was a proportionate reflection of the additional furniture  fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements at the subsidiary banks 
professional and data processing fees increased thousand  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a combination of additional legal  director  and other professional fees incurred by the subsidiary banks and by the parent company 
advertising and marketing expense grew thousand from thousand to million  respectively 
the increase was a result of the growth at the subsidiary banks along with special events and marketing materials showcasing the ten year anniversary of quad city bank trust  which occurred in the first quarter of bank service charges increased thousand  stationary and supplies expense grew thousand  and postage and phone expense increased thousand 
all of these increases were proportionate reflections of the company s growth during the year 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of thousand or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased income before income taxes of thousand or for fiscal  in combination with a slight decrease in the company s effective tax rate for to from for fiscal compared with the twelve months ended december  overview 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to net income of million for the twelve month period ended december  for an increase of thousand or 
basic earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to for the comparable period in the increase in net income was comprised of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million  partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income of million  and increases in noninterest expenses of thousand and federal and state income taxes of thousand 
several specific factors contributed to the improvement in net income from to for the twelve month periods 
primary factors included a improvement in net interest income prompted by increased volume  and a increase in gains on sales of real estate loans 
in october  the company sold its iso related merchant credit card portfolio to ipayment  inc  however bancard continued to process the portfolio s transactions through september the company s earnings for fiscal were positively impacted by the continued processing of these iso volumes 
this continued iso processing resulted in additional net income in fiscal of thousand or in diluted earnings per share 
the sale in october resulted in a gain of million  after income tax and related expenses  or in diluted earnings per share 
excluding both the one time gain from the sale of the iso portfolio in october  as well as the non recurring revenue from the continued processing through september  net income for the twelve months ended december  would have been million  or diluted earnings per share of  and net income for the twelve months ended december  would have been million  or diluted earnings per share of 
this represents a improvement in adjusted diluted earnings per share year to year 
although excluding the impact of these events is a non gaap measure  management believes that it is important to provide such information due to the non recurring nature of this income and to more accurately compare the results of the periods presented 
interest income 
interest income grew from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest earning assets  principally loans receivable  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 
the average yield on interest earning assets for the twelve months ended december  was as compared to for the twelve month period ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by thousand  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates  which was almost entirely offset by greater average outstanding balances in interest bearing liabilities 
the average cost on interest bearing liabilities was for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the like period in provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is established based on a number of factors  including the local and national economy and the risk associated with the loans in the portfolio 
the company had an allowance for estimated losses on loans of approximately of total gross loans at december   as compared to approximately at december   at june  and at june  the provision for loan losses remained stable at million for fiscal  as it had been for the twelve months ended december  during both periods  management made monthly provisions for loan losses based upon a number of factors  principally the increase in loans and a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
during fiscal  the million provision to the allowance for loan losses was attributed  or million  to net growth in the loan portfolio  and  or million  to downgrades and write offs within the portfolio 
for the twelve months ended december   commercial loans had total charge offs of million  which resulted primarily from a single customer relationship at quad city bank trust  and there were thousand of commercial recoveries  due primarily to this same relationship 
the net write off of this relationship accounted for of the provision for loans losses during fiscal and was in addition to a million charge off  which occurred during the quarter ended december  the additional losses were a result of environmental issues associated with the collateral for the loan  which were identified during the first quarter of the company believed that these environmental issues negatively impacted the value and salability of the business and determined that it was appropriate to take a conservative approach and write down the loan balance to reflect no value in the real estate and equipment collateral 
during the second quarter of  all of the collateral  including the real estate and equipment  was sold resulting in a thousand recovery 
in the third and fourth quarters  there were recoveries of thousand  as quad city bank trust realized gain from the sale of other real estate  which had been deferred in accordance with current accounting rules 
consumer loan charge offs and recoveries totaled thousand and thousand  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  real estate loans had no charge off or recovery activity during fiscal the ability to grow profitably is  in part  dependent upon the ability to maintain asset quality 
the company is focusing efforts at its subsidiary banks in an attempt to improve the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased by million from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal in the twelve months ended december   the largest component of noninterest income was the gain on sale of the iso related portion of the merchant credit card portfolio of million  which accounted for of the total 
noninterest income for both periods consisted of income from the merchant credit card operation  fees from the trust department  depository service fees  gains on the sale of residential real estate mortgage loans  and other miscellaneous fees 
making significant improvements from year to year in the noninterest income category were increases in gains on sales of loans and other miscellaneous fees 
during the twelve month period ended december   merchant credit card fees net of processing costs  decreased by thousand to million  from million for the comparable period in  reflecting little effect of the sale of the independent sales organization iso related merchant credit card activity to ipayment  inc in october  the company sold bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc for million 
after contractual compensation and severance payments  transaction expenses  and income taxes  the transaction resulted in a gain of million  or per share  which was realized during the quarter  ended december  also included in the sale were all of the merchant credit card processing relationships owned by allied 
bancard continues to provide credit card processing for its local merchants and cardholders of the subsidiary banks and agent banks 
through september   bancard also temporarily continued to process iso related transactions for ipayment  inc for a fixed monthly fee rather than a percentage of transaction volumes 
built into the sales contract with ipayment was an agreement that the fixed monthly fee would increase as the temporary processing period was extended 
extensions to the processing period and the resulting growth in the fixed monthly fee mitigated the drop in bancard s earnings that was expected to occur 
the transfer of this iso processing to another provider occurred in september  just prior to the close of the third quarter 
as the company anticipated  bancard s monthly earnings were reduced significantly in the final quarter of for the three quarters through september   bancard s net income was thousand  and for the fourth quarter of fiscal  bancard s net income was thousand 
for the twelve month periods ended both december  and  trust department fees were million 
the thousand  or  increase from year to year was primarily a reflection of the further development of existing trust relationships throughout and the addition of a significant volume of new trust relationships occurring late in the fourth quarter  which were almost entirely offset by the reduction of approximately million during the first quarter of a single trust account and its resulting impact on the calculation of trust fees for the remainder of the year 
deposit service fees increased thousand  or  to million from million for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was primarily a result of the growth in noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts of million  or  since december  service charges and nsf non sufficient funds charges related to demand deposit accounts were the main components of deposit service fees 
gains on sales of loans were million for fiscal  which reflected an increase of  or million  from million for the same period in the increase resulted from the lower mortgage rates that originated in calendar and continued throughout this situation created significantly more home refinances during the period and the subsequent sale of the majority of these loans into the secondary market 
because the gains on sales of loans typically have an inverse relationship with mortgage interest rates  it is unlikely that the subsidiary banks will continue to maintain this level of activity in the long term 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  refinancing volumes slowed dramatically from the pace that had existed in the three previous quarters 
for the twelve months ended december   other noninterest income increased thousand  or  to million from thousand for the same period in the increase was primarily due to a combination of improved earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance  gain realized on the sale of foreclosed property  increased earnings realized by nobel electronic transfer  llc  one of the three associated companies in which the company holds an interest  dividends earned on federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock  and increased fees generated from investment services offered at the subsidiary banks

compensation and other expenses related to the sale of the iso related merchant credit card portfolio of million accounted for of the million total in noninterest expenses for the twelve months ended december  contractual bonus and severance payments were based on the gain realized from the sale of bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc in october occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand  or  for the period 
the increase was due primarily to increased levels of rent  property taxes  utilities  depreciation  maintenance  and other occupancy expenses  in conjunction with thousand in losses on disposals of assets 
professional and data processing fees increased thousand  or  when comparing fiscal to the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to a combination of additional data processing fees incurred by the subsidiary banks and other professional fees incurred by the parent company

the commitments and contingent liabilities include various guarantees  commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the subsidiary banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the banks upon extension of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  marketable securities  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the subsidiary banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements and  generally  have terms of one year  or less 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the banks hold collateral  as described above  supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the banks would be required to fund the commitments 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the banks could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount 
if the commitment is funded  the banks would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer

essentially  all loan sales agreements require the repurchase of a mortgage loan by the seller in situations such as  breach of representation  warranty  or covenant  untimely document delivery  false or misleading statements  failure to obtain certain certificates or insurance  unmarketability  etc 
certain loan sales agreements contain repurchase requirements based on payment related defects that are defined in terms of the number of days months since the purchase  the sequence number of the payment  and or the number of days of payment delinquency 
based on the specific terms stated in the agreements of investors purchasing residential mortgage loans from the company s subsidiary banks  the company has million of sold residential mortgage loans with recourse provisions still in effect at december  the subsidiary banks did not repurchase any loans from secondary market investors under the terms of loans sales agreements during the years ended december  and  six months ended december   or the year ended june  in the opinion of management  the risk of recourse to the subsidiary banks is not significant  and accordingly no liabilities have been established related to such 
during fiscal  quad city bank trust joined the federal home loan bank s fhlb mortgage partnership finance mpf program  which offers a risk sharing alternative to selling residential mortgage loans to investors in the secondary market 
lenders funding mortgages through the mpf program manage the credit risk of the loans they originate 
the loans are funded by the fhlb and held within their portfolio  thereby managing the liquidity  interest rate  and prepayment risks of the loans 
lenders participating in the mpf program receive monthly credit enhancement fees for managing the credit risk of the loans they originate 
any credit losses incurred on those loans will be absorbed first by private mortgage insurance  second by an allowance established by the fhlb  and third by withholding monthly credit enhancements due to the participating lender 
at december   quad city bank trust had funded million of mortgages through the fhlb s mpf program with an attached credit exposure of thousand 
in conjunction with its participation in this program  quad city bank trust has established an allowance for credit losses on these off balance sheet exposures of thousand at december  bancard is subject to the risk of cardholder chargebacks and its merchants being incapable of refunding the amount charged back 
management attempts to mitigate such risk by regular monitoring of merchant activity and in appropriate cases  holding cash reserves deposited by the local merchant 
during  bancard experienced two situations  as the result of fraudulent activity  in which merchants experienced multiple  significant cardholder chargebacks over periods of several months 
in each of these cases  the merchant s cash reserves on deposit were not sufficient to cover the cardholder chargeback volumes  and in one case  the merchant was incapable of making reimbursement to bancard 
as a result  bancard incurred thousand of chargeback loss expense during absorbing all of the chargeback activity on this merchant and establishing an allowance for chargeback losses in the anticipation of additional cardholder chargebacks  which could occur from either of these situations 
as an additional mitigation to cardholder chargeback risk  in august bancard began making monthly provisions to the allowance for chargeback losses in an amount equal to basis points of the month s dollar volume of merchant credit card activity 
management will continually monitor merchant credit card activity and bancard s level of the allowance for chargeback losses

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

delaying the effective date of paragraphs of eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides guidance for determining the meaning of other than temporarily impaired and its application to certain debt and equity securities within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method 
the guidance requires that investments which have declined in value due to credit concerns or solely due to changes in interest rates must be recorded as other than temporarily impaired unless the company can assert and demonstrate its intention to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment which might mean maturity 
the delay of the effective date of eitf will be superceded concurrent with the final issuance of proposed fsp issue a 
proposed fsp issue a is intended to provide implementation guidance with respect to all securities analyzed for impairment under paragraphs of eitf management continues to closely monitor and evaluate how the provisions of eitf and proposed fsp issue a will affect the company 
in december  fasb published statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options and shares under employee stock purchase plans  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
the statement is effective at the beginning of the company s third quarter in as of the effective date  the company will have the option of applying the statement using a modified prospective application or a modified retrospective application 
under the prospective method compensation cost would be recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and for awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas under the retrospective application method compensation cost would be recognized as in above and for prior periods would be restated consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas the company has not yet made a decision on which method of application it will elect 
the impact of this statement on the company after the effective date and beyond will depend upon various factors  among them being the future compensation strategy

additional information concerning the company and its business  including other factors that could materially affect the company s financial results  is included in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
the company s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee of the board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the full board of each bank 
management also reviews quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust s securities portfolios  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may decide to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long term and short term interest rates 
one method used to quantify interest rate risk is a short term earnings at risk summary  which is a detailed and dynamic simulation model used to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
this simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis demonstrates net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and a basis point downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
the model assumes a parallel and pro rata shift in interest rates over a twelve month period 
application of the simulation model analysis at december  demonstrated a decrease in interest income with a basis point increase in interest rates  and a decrease in interest income with a basis point decrease in interest rates 
both simulations are within the board established policy limits of a decline in value 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
for that reason  the company engages the assistance of a national consulting firm and their risk management system to monitor and control the company s interest rate risk exposure 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities
