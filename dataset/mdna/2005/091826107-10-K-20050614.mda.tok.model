recent accounting pronouncements fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 

the guidance expanded upon and clarified existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of variable interest entities  including special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin no 
fin no 
r that modified some of the provisions and effective dates of fin no 
 and provided exemptions to certain entities from the original guidance 

table of contents fin no 
r sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated  and is based on the general premise that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  as amended  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established

r 
sfas no 
r is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fasb no 
 supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that companies recognize all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in the financial statements 
the recognized cost will be based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
pro forma disclosure of this cost will no longer be an alternative under sfas no 
r 
the statement is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  as permitted by fasb no 
 the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation plans under apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position or cash flows 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the amounts in its pro forma disclosure as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on sfas no 
r  the company will transition to the new requirements by using the modified prospective transition method 
this transition method requires compensation cost to be recognized for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption and for all unvested awards existing on the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current standards 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they are dependant on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions was   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r as of the first day of the first quarter of fiscal  or april   as required

the law also includes a tax deduction of up to percent of the lesser of a qualified production activities income or b taxable income

 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the fasb staff believes that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas the company is currently assessing the impact of this special deduction on its deferred taxes 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp allows additional time to assess the effect of repatriating international earnings under the law  and requires explanatory disclosures from those who need the additional time 
the company is evaluating the effects of the law  and recent regulations  on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of international earnings 
the possible amounts of unremitted earnings available for repatriation under the law  and the potential range of income tax effects of such repatriation  cannot be reasonably estimated as of the time of this filing 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition within the company s hotline services  revenues are recognized when title to products sold passes to the customer  which generally occurs upon shipment from the company s location 
within the company s data and voice services  revenues are recognized from maintenance service contracts  moves  adds and changes and network integration services  when the services are provided and revenues generally are recognized from the sale of ip application software upon delivery 
service contracts are generally pre billed and are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and are generally recognized as revenue over the service period on a straight line basis 
revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized immediately in the financial statements 

table of contents the company has historically made reasonably accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain clients estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire client pool 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to specifically identified at risk receivables 
in addition to specific reserves  a general reserve is provided based upon the age of the receivables 
the company s policy is to fully reserve for accounts receivable when an account is determined to be uncollectible 
inventories and related inventory reserves the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value and has been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records an estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory based upon product knowledge  physical inventory observation  future demand and market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reductions to inventory may be required 
upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory  the corresponding reserve for impaired value is relieved to ensure that the cost basis of the inventory reflects any reductions 
loss contingencies the company incurs contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  such as future warranty obligations and potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters 
the company accrues for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
deferred tax valuation allowances should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in the company s business model  capital strategy  economic conditions or operating performance 
the company s evaluation is based upon  among other things  assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
the company continually applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to test goodwill and indefinite life intangibles for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
estimated fair values of reporting units are estimated using an earnings model and a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates to use to discount those estimated cash flows 
significant changes to the judgments and estimates used in the models could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
restructuring the company accrues the cost of restructuring activities in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
the company exercises its judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as these activities are implemented  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of the initial cost accrual 
inflation the overall effects of inflation on the company have been nominal 
although long term inflation rates are difficult to predict  the company continues to strive to minimize the effect of inflation through improved productivity and cost reduction programs as well as price adjustments within the constraints of market competition 
risk factors the company operates in a highly competitive industry the company has a variety of competitors
