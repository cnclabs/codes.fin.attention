beginning in  management began re underwriting the book of business emphasizing less hazardous insureds  and began shifting the book of business to loss sensitive policies where the insured retains a significant amount of losses 
as a result of these initiatives and as the actuarial data for these years matured  management has determined that its best estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense should be reduced for those three accident years 
losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended included adverse development of approximately million attributable to one multi year construction account that was non renewed in january and a million charge related to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for balances due from reinsurers 
in the aggregate  the adverse development and increase to the allowance account resulted in an increase of approximately eight points in the calendar year loss ratio

with the elimination of non strategic products  argonaut insurance company reduced its workforce by employees in the first quarter of the restructuring effort along with continued expense management initiatives have resulted in decreased levels of expenses for compared to prior years 
due to the loss sensitive nature of the business underwritten by risk management  the expense ratio is higher than if the business were written on a guaranteed cost basis

run off lines 
the company has discontinued active underwriting of certain lines of business  however  the company is still obligated to pay losses incurred on these lines which include general liability and medical malpractice policies written in past years

argonaut insurance company is exposed to asbestos liability at the primary level through claims filed against its direct insureds  as well as through its position as a reinsurer of other primary carriers 
argonaut insurance company s direct liability arises primarily from policies issued from the mid s to early s which pre dated policy contract wording that excluded asbestos exposure 
during the company settled its largest direct exposure for million see discussion below 
the majority of the policies were issued on behalf of small contractors or construction companies 
the company believes that the frequency and severity of asbestos claims for such insureds is typically less than that experienced for large  industrial manufacturing and distribution concerns 

table of contents argonaut insurance company also assumed risk as a reinsurer for a limited period of time  primarily for the period from to  a portion of which was assumed from the london market 
argonaut insurance company also reinsured risks on policies written by domestic carriers 
such reinsurance typically provided coverage for limits attaching at a relatively high dollar amount which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted 
some of the claims now being filed on policies reinsured by argonaut insurance company are on behalf of claimants who may have been exposed at some time to asbestos incorporated into buildings they occupied  but have no current medical problems resulting from such exposure 
additionally  lawsuits are being brought against businesses that were not directly involved in the manufacture or installation of materials containing asbestos 
the company believes that claims generated out of this population of claimants may result in incurred losses generally lower than the asbestos claims filed over the past decade and could be below argonaut insurance company s attachment level

table of contents annually the company reviews its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for its run off lines of business  inclusive of its asbestos and environmental claims 
the process is initiated at the end of the second quarter and is typically completed in the third quarter of the calendar year 
the review entails a detailed analysis of the company s direct and assumed exposure 
the company engages a consulting actuary to provide its best estimate of ultimate losses and management evaluates that estimate in assessing the adequacy of the run off loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
as of december   the company recorded reserves are within of the best estimate provided by the consulting actuary s best estimate 
the review completed during the third quarter of  and updated in the fourth quarter  indicated the carried reserves were adequate based on all information then available to the company 
in  the company completed its analysis of the recoverability of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for its run off lines which include asbestos and environmental claims for its run off lines 
this analysis resulted in a decrease to ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  and a corresponding increase to net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and a related expense of million 
the company revised its analysis that projects anticipated future ceded reinsurance recoveries relative to existing claims and incurred but not reported claims 
the analysis relied on identification of reinsurance contracts that the company purchased at the time the policies were in force 
these reinsurance contracts provide coverage for specific policy contracts for which the company has claim exposure 
previously  the company utilized historical relationships of ceded losses to gross losses to estimate expected future ceded losses 
the current approach incorporates more of the specific characteristics of the existing and expected claims  or related policies and reinsurance contracts 
accordingly  management believes it provides a more refined estimate of expected future ceded loss recoveries 
for the year ended december   the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by million 
the company strengthened these reserves by million in the third quarter of due to the identification of policies written from into the early s that failed to include the asbestos coverage exclusion 
the company determined that the policies issued with this error were confined to general liability policies processed at one particular office 
additionally  the company completed its annual analysis of reserves for the run off lines in the fourth quarter of and as a result strengthened its net asbestos reserves by million 
the decision to strengthen asbestos reserves was the result of an evaluation and review of exposure to asbestos claims  particularly in light of industry and litigation trends  actual claims experience  and actuarial analysis by the company s consulting and internal actuaries 
total reserves for run off lines as of december  were million  net of reinsurance but before effects of the adverse development cover  including reserves for asbestos and environmental claims of million 
additional information relating to the adc is included under item business reinsurance on pages 
management uses various actuarial methods to determine its best estimate of losses for the run off lines in total  which resulted in a range of potential ultimate liability  net of reinsurance  of million to million 
in determining its best estimate  management primarily relied on the report year method  with some weight given to other methods 
the report year method relies most heavily on the company s historical claims and severity information  whereas other methods rely more heavily on industry information 
this method produces an estimate of losses which have been incurred but not yet reported based on projections of numbers of future claims and the average severity for those future claims 
the severities were calculated based on the company s specific data and in management s opinion best reflect the company s liabilities based upon the insurance policies issued 
as a result of this reserve analysis  the reserve for incurred but not reported asbestos and environmental claims net of reinsurance at december   was million compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims for the remaining run off lines net of reinsurance was million as of december   compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the following table represents a reconciliation of the number of asbestos and environmental claims outstanding for each of the years in the three year period ended december  open claims  beginning of the year claims closed during the year claims opened during the year open claims  end of the year 
table of contents the number of claims opened during the three years ended december  were from the following sources direct assumed domestic assumed london total open claims new claims in the reinsurance assumed categories are primarily the result of the company typically providing coverage for higher limits which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted 
additionally  there tend to be long delays in the ceding companies reporting claims to the reinsurers 
the following table represents gross payments on asbestos and environmental claims for each of the years in the three year period ended december  gross payments on closed claims gross payments on open claims total gross payments included in the gross payments on closed claims in is a settlement relating to the western macarthur litigation 
the company  through its subsidiary argonaut insurance company  was named in various legal actions filed by western macarthur company  western asbestos company the macarthur companies and certain other individual claimants 
argonaut insurance company s involvement in these actions arose from nine construction wrap up policies with an occurrence limit of  per policy issued to western macarthur company and western asbestos company  respectively  for liability arising out of work performed on five construction sites in the s and s 
on april   the bankruptcy court presiding over the chapter bankruptcy of the macarthur companies entered orders giving final approval to settlements reached with all property and casualty insurers of the macarthur companies currently in litigation  including argonaut insurance company 
a bankruptcy reorganization plan filed by the macarthur companies will be implemented and all existing and future claims against the macarthur companies related to asbestos will be channeled solely to a trust 
argonaut insurance company contributed million into the bankruptcy trust and received a release from the macarthur companies as to any and all existing or future asbestos related claims  including any claims for extra contractual relief  arising directly or indirectly out of any alleged coverage under the nine argonaut insurance company polices at issue 
in addition  claimants seeking funds from the trust will be required to execute release and indemnity agreements in favor of argonaut insurance company as a condition to receiving payment 
the company ceded the majority of its million contribution to its reinsurers 
because of the types of coverages within argonaut insurance company s run off lines of business  a significant amount of subjectivity and uncertainty exists in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
factors that increase these uncertainties are lack of historical data  inapplicability of standard actuarial projection techniques  uncertainties regarding ultimate claim costs  coverage interpretations  and the judicial  statutory and regulatory environments under which these claims may ultimately be resolved 
significant uncertainty remains as to the ultimate liability to the company due to the potentially long waiting period between exposure and emergence of any bodily injury or property damage and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims 
additionally  recent industry trends show an increasing number of claims being filed by individuals who claim asbestos exposure  but who have no symptoms of asbestos related disease 
due to these uncertainties  the current trends may not be indicative of future results 
although management has determined and recorded its best estimate of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for run off lines  current judicial and legislative decisions continue to broaden liability  expand policy scopes and increase the severity of claims payments 
as a result of these and other recent developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate loss reserves are heightened  further complicating the already complex process of determining loss reserves 
the industry as a whole is involved in extensive litigation over these coverages and liability issues  and must contend with the continuing uncertainty in its effort to quantify these exposures 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash flow sources are premiums and investment income 
the primary cash outflows are claim payments and operating expenses 
the nature of insurance is that cash collected on premiums written is invested  interest and dividends are 
table of contents earned thereon  and loss and settlement expenses are paid out over a period of years

table of contents concerns over terrorist activity have both curtailed the availability of reinsurance for terrorism related risks and increased the cost of obtaining such reinsurance where it is still available 
the effect of this industry wide phenomenon on the company s insurance subsidiaries varies by line of business  but reinsurance coverage for terrorist acts involving nuclear  biological and chemical agents is no longer available or cost prohibitive in some instances  thus preventing ceding of these risks through reinsurance
