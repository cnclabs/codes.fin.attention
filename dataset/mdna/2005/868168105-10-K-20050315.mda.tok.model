item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview pricing pressures have intensified as suppliers in asia and other areas of the world enter our market and existing domestic competitors have become more aggressive in their efforts to fill available plant capacity 
additionally  our domestic customers are requiring their suppliers to reduce their sales prices 
while we have ongoing programs to reduce our own costs through process automation and identification of industry best practices  and had been successful in substantially mitigating these pricing pressures in the past  it has become increasingly more difficult to do so 
given the continuing nature of these pricing pressures today  and the lengthy time periods necessary to implement best practices and to reduce labor and other costs through automation  our profit margins will continue to be less than our historical levels 
we will continue to attempt to increase our operating margins from current operating levels by aggressively implementing cost savings strategies to meet customer pricing expectations and increasing industry wide price competition 
however  the impact of these strategies on our future financial position and results of operations will be negative  the extent of which cannot be predicted  and we may not be able to develop and implement sufficient cost savings strategies to offset the impact of these pricing pressures on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit percent of net sales operating income percent of net sales net income percent of net sales diluted earnings per share sales in  total revenues increased approximately percent  while unit shipments to the major vehicle original equipment manufacturers oem increased by less than percent over the prior year 
consolidated net sales increased million to million in from million in excluding project development revenues  which totaled million this year compared to million a year ago  aluminum wheel sales increased million in to million from million a year ago  a percent increase compared to the one half percent increase in unit shipments  due to the average selling price of our wheels increasing approximately percent 
an increase in the pass through price of aluminum increased the average selling price by approximately percent and the shift in mix to larger and chrome plated wheels during  net of price discounts to our customers  increased the average selling price by an additional percent 
consolidated net sales in also included million of aluminum suspension component sales compared to million in unit shipments to ford motor company ford and general motors corporation gm totaled percent of total oem unit shipments in compared to percent a year ago 
the balance of unit shipments to daimlerchrysler and to our international customers totaled percent and percent  respectively  compared to percent and percent  respectively  in the increase of one half percent in oem aluminum wheel unit shipments in compares favorably to a decrease of percent in north american automotive production of passenger cars and light trucks  indicating further market share gains in this is principally due to our winning major new wheel contracts and  to a lesser extent  the increasing aluminum wheel penetration rate 
according to ward s automotive yearbook  an auto industry publication  aluminum wheel installation rates on automobiles 
table of contents and light trucks in the us rose slightly to percent for the model year 
aluminum wheel installation rates have increased to this level since the mid s  when this rate was only percent 
however  in recent years  this rate has slowed  increasing only percent from percent for the model year  a trend which we expect to continue 
in addition  our ability to grow will be negatively impacted by the customer pricing pressure cited above and overall economic conditions that impact the sales of passenger cars and light trucks 
consolidated net sales in increased million  or percent  to million from million in excluding project development revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in  oem wheel sales increased to million from million in  a percent increase compared to a percent increase in unit shipments 
the increase in oem aluminum wheel shipments in compared favorably to the decrease of percent in north american automotive production of passenger cars and light trucks 
the average selling price of our wheels in increased approximately percent from  as a shift in mix to larger wheels  net of price discounts to our customers  increased the average selling price by approximately percent  and an increase in the pass through price of aluminum increased the average selling price by approximately percent 
gross profit during  gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in the principal factors impacting our gross profit were continued global pricing pressures from our customers  decreased demand for high volume  high profit specialty wheels and additional unreimbursed developmental expenses related to new wheel and aluminum suspension components opportunities 
furthermore  following our plant shutdowns in early july of  our oem customers announced extended shutdowns of their plants  due to high inventory levels at the end of the second quarter of additionally  erratic customer shipment schedules during the last half of the year exacerbated our ability to achieve a steady state of efficient production at several of our plants 
these conditions are expected to continue into finally  the process of further automating and expanding our production facilities and implementing best practices in an effort to reduce our own cost structure  respond to customer changes in cosmetic and quality standards and improve product flow due to a higher mix of larger diameter wheels  has caused  and is expected to continue to cause for a period of time  various operating issues and inefficiencies 
these include material handling problems due to the relocation of production equipment and conveyor systems  decreased productivity on larger diameter wheels due to fewer wheels being processed per hour  additional operations required on certain wheels  etc 
as a result  our labor costs are higher than normal because the planned labor savings from the various automation programs being implemented cannot be attained due to the deferral of headcount reductions to handle additional rework caused by higher internal reject rates 
although we continue to make progress in correcting these issues and inefficiencies  we cannot predict when these programs will be fully implemented 
also included in gross profit is the loss of the aluminum suspension component business of million in compared to million a year ago 
the operating loss in was greater than anticipated due to our inability to efficiently meet the start up demands of new programs and higher shipment level in the nd half of the year  and unexpected equipment failures 
these factors caused excessive overtime and additional expense for expedited shipments to meet customer demand 
during  gross profit decreased million to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in beginning with the first quarter of  the operating results of the aluminum suspension components business are no longer shown as a separate line item in the statement of income and are included in the determination of gross profit 
this change reduced gross profit in by million  or percent of net sales  representing the loss experienced in that business 
the principal factors impacting gross profit were continued customer price reductions and decreases in certain high volume  high profit specialty wheels 
to a lesser extent  our gross profit was also impacted by decreased utilization rates in our us manufacturing facilities while three of the plants were being expanded  extra costs and inefficiencies related to these plant expansions and additional costs and delays related to a record number of new wheel program launches 
additionally  the difference between the market price and the fixed price of aluminum delivered during pursuant to our aluminum contracts negatively impacted gross profit 
during the fourth quarter of  all future fixed price aluminum purchase commitments were liquidated at a price that approximated contract value 

table of contents the cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel 
additionally  a portion of our selling prices to oem customers is attributable to the cost of aluminum 
our selling prices are adjusted periodically to current aluminum market conditions based upon market price changes during specific pricing periods 
theoretically  assuming selling price adjustments and raw material purchase prices move at the same rate  as the price of aluminum increases  the effect is an overall decrease in the gross margin percentage  since the gross profit in absolute dollars would be the same 
the opposite would then be true in periods during which the price of aluminum decreases 
other factors impacting our gross margin percentage are the continued pricing pressures from our customers and increasing global industry wide competition 
pricing pressures have intensified as suppliers in asia and other areas of the world enter the market and competitors become more aggressive in their efforts to fill open plant capacity 
while we have ongoing programs to reduce costs and  in the past  have been successful in substantially mitigating these pricing pressures  it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so without impacting margins 
we will continue to aggressively implement cost savings strategies to meet customer pricing expectations and industry wide competition in order to improve our gross profit margins from current levels 
however  the impact of these factors on our future financial position and results of operations cannot be predicted  and we may not be able to implement sufficient cost savings strategies to mitigate any future negative impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of net sales in  compared to million  or percent of net sales in and million  or percent of net sales in in  higher retirement costs and professional fees  principally related to audit  offset lower compensation costs  principally bonuses  due to the decreased profitability 
the increase in versus was due primarily to slightly higher compensation costs and related fringes 
provision for doubtful accounts on february   tower automotive  inc  an aluminum suspension components customer  filed to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the financial statements for the year ended december   include a provision for doubtful accounts totaling million to cover the potential write off of receivables at december  aluminum suspension components start up costs beginning with the first quarter of  the operating results of our aluminum suspension and related underbody components business in heber springs  arkansas have been included in the determination of gross profit 
prior to that date  the initial developmental start up costs associated with this business  which totaled million in  were shown as start up costs in the consolidated statement of income 
interest income  net interest income for the year increased slightly to million from million in  as the additional interest earned on the million increase in cash available for investment was offset by a slight decrease in the average rate of return  which approximated percent 
interest income in decreased to million from million in  as the average rate of return decreased to percent from percent 
equity in earnings of joint ventures we have two percent owned joint ventures topy superior limited tsl  which earns a commission for marketing our products to potential oem customers based in asia  and suoftec light metal products  ltd 
suoftec  a manufacturer of both light weight forged and cast aluminum wheels in hungary 
the investment in these joint ventures is accounted for utilizing the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  our share of joint venture net income is included in the consolidated statements of income in equity in earnings of joint ventures 
the net operating results of the tsl joint venture did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents our share of suoftec s net income amounted to million in compared to million in  and million in the decrease in profitability in was due principally to a percent decline in unit shipments  lower average selling prices and higher operating costs due to a recent expansion of the casting operation 
the decrease in operating results was partially offset by an increase in the foreign exchange rate of the euro compared to the us dollar 
the improvement in profitability in compared to was due equally to significant increases in the foreign exchange rate of the euro compared to the us dollar and to manufacturing cost reductions 
in order to meet the expected increase in demand of the european aluminum wheel market  the joint venture s plant was expanded in to increase annual capacity by approximately percent to million cast and forged wheels 
see note investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the suoftec joint venture 
effective income tax rate the consolidated tax rate in was percent of pretax income compared to percent in and the relationship of federal tax credits  permanent tax differences and foreign income  which is taxed at rates other than statutory  to a lower pretax income in the current period are the principal reasons for the decrease in the effective income tax rate 
accounting judgment is required when reserving for probable disallowance of identified exposures 
accounting rules dictate that general reserves are not allowed and that changed substantive facts or specific events must exist to change reserve amounts 
the resolution of an audit by taxing authorities or the expiration of a statute of limitations governs when a reserve is no longer required for a given exposure 
during and  statutes expired on certain previously identified exposures  while certain additional exposures were identified 
the net effect of these changes was an increase in required tax reserves of million in and million in net income as a result of the above  net income in decreased million  or percent  to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in diluted earnings per share decreased  or percent  to in from a year ago 
net income in decreased million to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in diluted earnings per share in decreased to from in liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and short term investments  net cash provided by operating activities  amounts available under credit facilities and other external sources of funds 
during the three years ended december   we had no long term debt and had not utilized an uncommitted million line of credit 
at december   our cash and short term investments totaled million compared to cash and million a year ago and million at the end of the decrease in cash and short term investments in was due to our investing million in long term corporate bonds during the year  which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  all working capital requirements  investing activities  cash dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock during these three years have been funded from internally generated funds  the exercise of stock options or existing cash and short term investments 
the following table summarizes the cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we generate our principal working capital resources primarily through operations 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the million decrease in net income was offset by favorable changes in non cash items totaling million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the principal favorable changes in non cash items were in depreciation and equity in earnings of joint ventures 
the favorable change in operating assets and liabilities was due principally to favorable changes in funding requirements of accounts payable  totaling million  and accounts receivable  totaling million  offset by an unfavorable change in funding requirements of inventories  totaling million 

table of contents the increased requirements for accounts payable in the current period were due principally to the timing of payments for raw materials and capital expenditures 
cash required to fund the increase in accounts receivable from customers in the current period was million versus a requirement of million in the same period a year ago  as the increase in customer sales was less in the current period 
the higher funding requirement for inventories in the current period was due principally to a sharp reduction in customer releases in the th quarter and a percent increase in the cost of aluminum 
the million cash flow from operating activities in  the million in short term investments from a year ago  and the million proceeds from the exercise of company stock options were used for capital expenditures of million  for cash dividends of million  for common stock repurchases totaling million  with the balance reinvested in long term and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in included million for wheel manufacturing operations and million for the aluminum suspension components operation 
the principal expenditures for the wheel facilities were for automation projects and ongoing improvements 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in from million in  due principally to a net unfavorable change in working capital requirements 
cash required to fund the increases in accounts receivable from customers and to pay suppliers and employees for materials and labor and overhead decreased by million and million  respectively 
cash requirements for capital expenditures and income taxes increased in by million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash requirements for capital items in was due principally to the high level of plant expansion activity in the latter part of payables related to capital items generally have extended payment terms from the date of receipt until final approval and payment 
the million cash flow from operating activities in  the million in short term investments from the year prior  and the million proceeds from the exercise of company stock options were used for capital expenditures of million  for cash dividends of million  and for common stock repurchases totaling million 
capital expenditures in included expansions of three of our wheel plant facilities in arkansas and kansas  as well as ongoing improvements at our other locations 
over the past sixteen years  we have expended over million for new plants  expansion programs and ongoing improvements 
the majority of the expansion financing was sourced from internally generated cash flow  to construct and expand our world class road wheel facilities and to continuously improve all of our manufacturing plants 
including the construction of our third wheel facility in chihuahua  mexico  capital expenditures in and are expected to approximate million 
this estimate does not include the possibility of a joint venture wheel plant in asia 
we anticipate funding these capital expenditures from internally generated cash flow and  to the extent necessary  from existing cash and short term and long term investments 
our financial condition remained strong in working capital of million at december  included million in cash and short term investments 
the current ratio at year end was compared to a year ago 
accordingly  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of new and complementary business opportunities  to further expand into international markets and to withstand any moderate downturns in the economy 
risk management we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due  in part  to the competitive global nature of the industry in which we operate  to changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products  and to development of new products  such as our aluminum suspension and related underbody components 
we have foreign operations in mexico and hungary that  due to the settlement of accounts receivable  and accounts payable  require the transfer of funds denominated in their respective functional currencies the mexican peso and the euro 
the value of the mexican peso varied during  but was virtually unchanged in relation to the us dollar at the end of the year 
the euro  on the other hand  experienced a percent increase versus the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which are included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of income  have not been significant 
as it relates to foreign currency translation gains and losses  however  since  the mexican peso has experienced periods of elative stability followed by periods of major declines in value 
the impact of these changes in value relative to 
table of contents our mexico operations has resulted in a cumulative unrealized translation loss at december  of million 
since our initial investment in our joint venture in hungary in  the fluctuations in functional currencies originally the german deutsche mark and now the euro have resulted in a cumulative unrealized translation gain at december  of million 
translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
our primary risk exposure relating to derivative financial instruments result from the periodic use of foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of currency rate fluctuations with regard to foreign denominated receivables  payables or purchase obligations 
at december   we held open foreign currency euro forward contracts totaling million  with an unrealized gain of million 
at december   we held open foreign currency euro forward contracts totaling million  with an unrealized gain of million 
any unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity until the actual contract settlement date 
percent changes in the euro us dollar exchange rate will impact the unrealized gain loss by a similar percentage of the current market value 
we do not have similar derivative instruments for the mexican peso 
when market conditions warrant  we will also enter into contracts to purchase certain commodities used in the manufacture of our products  such as aluminum  natural gas  environmental emission credits and other raw materials 
any such commodity commitments are expected to be purchased and used over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  they are not accounted for as a derivative 
we currently have several purchase agreements for the delivery of natural gas over the next three years 
the contract value and fair value of these purchase commitments approximated million and million  respectively  at december  as of december   the aggregate contract value and fair value of all purchase commitments were million and million  respectively  including purchase commitments for the delivery of aluminum in and  and purchase commitments for the delivery of natural gas in through the aluminum purchase commitments were delivered as agreed and the aluminum purchase commitments were liquidated in november at a price that approximated our contract price 
purchases under commodity contracts for the three years ended december   totaled million in  million in  and million in percentage changes in the market prices of natural gas will impact the fair value by a similar percentage 
we do not hold or purchase any natural gas forward contracts for trading purposes 
the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total commodity contracts retirement plans euro forward contracts operating leases total contractual inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the three years ended december  wage increases have averaged to percent during this period and  as indicated above  cost increases of our principal raw material  aluminum  are passed through to our customers 
however  cost increases for our other raw materials and for energy may not be similarly recovered in our selling prices 
additionally  the competitive global pricing pressures we have experienced recently are expected to continue  which will also lessen the possibility of recovering these types of cost increases 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to apply significant judgment in making estimates and 
table of contents assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  as well as financial information included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  industry trends  terms of various past and present agreements and contracts  and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent through other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results reported in the future will not differ from these estimates  or that future changes in these estimates will not adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates and assumptions as to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  estimated useful lives of our long lived assets  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to self insured portions of employee benefits  workers compensation and general liability programs and taxation 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  industry trends  terms of various past and present agreements and contracts  and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent through other sources 
revenue recognition our products are manufactured to customer specification under standard purchase orders 
we ship our products to oem customers based on release schedules provided weekly by our customers 
our sales and production levels are highly dependent upon the weekly production levels of our customers 
sales of these products  net of estimated pricing adjustments  and their related costs are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  generally upon shipment 
a portion of our selling prices to oem customers is attributable to the aluminum content of our wheels 
our selling prices are adjusted periodically for changes in the current aluminum market based upon specified aluminum price indices during specific pricing periods  as agreed with our customers 
project development revenues for the development of wheels and components and related initial tooling that are reimbursed by our customers are recognized as such related costs and expenses are incurred and recoverability is confirmed by the issuance of a customer purchase order 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon the expected collectibility of all trade receivables 
the allowance is reviewed continually and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and categorized as raw material  work in process or finished goods 
when necessary  management uses estimates of net realized value to record inventory reserves for obsolete and or slow moving inventory 
each quarter  our inventory values  which are based upon standard costs for raw materials and labor and overhead established at the beginning of the year  are adjusted to estimated actual costs through the recording of a first in  first out fifo adjustment 
current raw material prices and labor and overhead costs are utilized in developing these adjustments 
retirement plans subject to certain vesting requirements  our unfunded retirement plans generally provide for a benefit based on final average compensation  which becomes payable on the employee s death or upon attaining age  if retired 
the net pension cost and related benefit obligations are based on  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate  future salary increases and the mortality of the participants 
the periodic costs and related obligations are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
product liability and loss reserves workers compensation accruals are based upon reported claims in process and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported 
loss reserves  including incurred but not reported reserves  are based on estimates developed by third party administrators and actuaries  and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or the severity of claims 
income tax reserves despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  experience has shown that taxing authorities can challenge certain positions 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or even litigation 
accordingly  accounting judgment is required in evaluating our tax reserves  which are adjusted only in light of substantive changes in facts and circumstances  such as the resolution of an audit by taxing authorities or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
accordingly  our tax expense for a given period will include reserve provisions for newly identified exposures  as well as reserve reductions for exposures resolved through audit  expiration of a statute of limitations or other substantive changes in facts and circumstances 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb 
table of contents no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal which was the criterion specified in arb no 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the new standard shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate the adoption of this new accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments sbp  fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r  that requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
under fas r  sbp awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
as a public company  we are allowed to select from three alternative transition methods each having different reporting implications 
the effective date for fas r is the period beginning july   and applies to all outstanding and unvested sbp awards at our adoption date 
we have not completed our evaluation or determined the impact of adopting fas r 
however  we have disclosed the proforma impact of our employee stock options  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and reports and other public statements to our shareholders 
these statements may  for example  express expectations or projections about future actions or results that we may anticipate but  due to developments beyond our control  do not materialize 
actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook 
we assume no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements 
global pricing 
we continue to experience increased competition in our domestic and international markets 
in addition to the fact that some initial products are being shipped to the us from asia  many of our competitors have excess capacity and  because of their financial condition  are placing intense pricing pressure in our market place 
these competitive pressures are expected to continue and may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions  resulting in lower revenues  gross profit and operating income 
key customers 
ford and gm were our only customers accounting for more than percent of consolidated net sales in gm and ford together represented approximately percent of our annual sales in and percent and percent of total sales in and  respectively 
the loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to either or both of these two customers would have a material adverse impact on our financial results  unless the lost volume could be replaced 
however  we believe this risk is somewhat offset in short term periods because our different wheel programs with these two customers are with different divisions and expire on differing dates 
decline in production of passenger cars and light trucks 
a significant decline in the production of passenger cars and or light trucks by automobile manufacturers would adversely affect our revenue and if such decline continues for a sustained period  would have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
new component products 
we have made a significant investment in research  development and marketing for the automotive suspension and underbody components business 
significant revenue from these investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
the future success of this business is highly dependent on our ability to obtain additional contract awards  which in part depends on industry conversion to lighter aluminum components 

table of contents litigation 
we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits  including product liability and other matters 
while we believe that none of the litigation matters in which we are currently involved will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  it is possible that  even though we believe we have adequate insurance coverage or are likely to prevail on the merits  one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that would ultimately have a material impact on our financial condition  and could negatively impact our revenues  operating margins and net income 
international operations 
we manufacture our products in mexico and hungary and sell our products throughout the world 
unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures  trade protection laws  policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investments  social  political  labor  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  including foreign exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and foreign tax consequences  among other factors  could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
other 
other issues and uncertainties include changes in us  global or regional economic conditions  currency exchange rates  war or significant terrorist acts  or political instability in major markets  all of which may affect automobile sales  which in turn could cause our customers to cancel orders  as has happened in the past  periodic or sustained shortages of natural gas and other energy sources that may impact our performance and profitability  changes in commodity prices of the materials used in our products  or substantial increases in material costs that may impact the demand for aluminum wheels  changes in the laws  regulations  policies  or other activities of governments  agencies  and similar organizations where such actions may affect our ability to produce products at a competitive price  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  such as earthquakes  tornados and hurricanes  which may  among other things  impair production at our manufacturing facilities  our ability to attract or retain key employees to operate our manufacturing facilities and corporate office  success of our strategic and operating plans to properly direct the company  including obtaining new contracts for our suspension and underbody components business  and  international  political and military developments that may affect automobile production and sales 
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are by no means complete 
additional factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are contained in this annual report on form k and other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due  in part  to the global competitive nature of the industry in which we operate  to changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products  and to development of new products  such as our aluminum suspension and related underbody components 
we have foreign operations in mexico and hungary that  due to cash transfers and intercompany wheel purchases  require the transfer of funds denominated in their respective functional currencies the mexican peso and the euro 
the value of the mexican peso varied during  but was virtually unchanged in relation to the us dollar at the end of the year 
the euro  on the other hand  experienced a percent increase versus the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which are included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of income  have not been significant 
as it relates to foreign currency translation losses  however  since  the mexican peso has experienced periods of elative stability followed by periods of major declines in value 
the impact of these changes in value relative to our mexico operations has resulted in a cumulative unrealized translation loss at december  of 
table of contents million 
since our initial investment in our joint venture in hungary in  the fluctuations in functional currencies originally the german deutsche mark and now the euro have resulted in a cumulative unrealized translation gain at december  of million 
translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
our primary risk exposure relating to derivative financial instruments result from the periodic use of foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of currency rate fluctuations with regard to foreign denominated receivables  payables or purchase obligations 
at december   we held open foreign currency euro forward contracts totaling million  with an unrealized gain of million 
at december   we held open foreign currency euro forward contracts totaling million  with an unrealized gain of million 
any unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity until the actual contract settlement date 
percent changes in the euro us dollar exchange rate will impact the unrealized gain loss by a similar percentage of the current market value 
when market conditions warrant  we will also enter into contracts to purchase certain commodities used in the manufacture of our products  such as aluminum  natural gas  environmental emission credits and other raw materials 
any such commodity commitments are expected to be purchased and used over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  they are not accounted for as a derivative 
we currently have several purchase agreements for the delivery of natural gas over the next three years 
the contract value and fair value of these purchase commitments approximated million and million  respectively  at december  as of december   the aggregate contract value and fair value of all purchase commitments were million and million  respectively  including purchase commitments for the delivery of aluminum in and  and purchase commitments for the delivery of natural gas in through the aluminum purchase commitments were delivered as agreed and the aluminum purchase commitments were liquidated in november at a price that approximated our contract price 
purchases under commodity contracts for the three years ended december   totaled million in  million in  and million in percentage changes in the market prices of natural gas will impact the fair value by a similar percentage 
we do not hold or purchase any natural gas forward contracts for trading purposes
