founded in  inforte is headquartered in chicago and has atlanta  dallas  delhi  india  hamburg  germany  london  irvine  california  new york  san francisco  walldorf  germany  and washington  dc our revenue is derived almost entirely through the performance of professional services 
the majority of the services we perform is on a time and materials basis  however  we also perform services on a fixed price basis if this structure best fits out clients preferences or the requirements of the project 
typically  the first portion of an engagement involves a strategy project or a discovery phase lasting to days 
this work enables us to determine with our clients the scope of successive phases of work 
these successive phases of work can be additional strategy phases  or phases for technology design and implementation  and generally last three to nine months 
if a project is to be performed on a fixed price basis  the fixed price is based upon estimates from senior personnel in our consulting organization who project the length of the engagement  the number of people required to complete the engagement and the skill level and billing rates of those people 
we then adjust the fixed price based on various qualitative risk factors such as the aggressiveness of the delivery deadline  the technical complexity of the solution and the value of the solution delivered to the client 
we typically ask clients to pay of our fixed price projects in advance to enable us to secure a project team in a timeframe that is responsive to the client s needs

net revenue excludes reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this increase in revenues in part to the acquisition of our new sap practice as well as to an increased demand for our services 
for the year ended december   we had significant clients with each of these clients contributing million to net revenue on average 
we had significant clients during the year ended december   each contributing million to net revenue on average 
we had one significant client contributing more than from net revenue each in and two clients contributed more than from net revenue in project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our professional employees who deliver consulting services and non reimbursable project costs 
all labor costs for project personnel are included in project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from growth in consulting headcount  increased compensation and an increased use of outside contractors

further  project personnel and related expenses were reduced both in and by a downward adjustment of  and  respectively  in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of december   compared to  as of december  the revised balances reflect more accurately our exposure to loss from non paying customers  due to the higher number of established relationships with long term clients 
the adjustments in both years were not due to any write off of a specific customer account 
project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is due to the higher use of subcontractors in in addition to higher project personnel compensation charges 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   down from  in the year ended december  the change in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year is a result of the decrease in consultants utilization combined with a decline in the average effective hourly rates of our consultants 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups as well as costs to execute marketing programs 
sales and marketing and expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this slight increase is due to a combination of intensified marketing activities partially offset by lower headcount related costs in this area  resulting in lower salary  benefit costs and travel expenses 
total sales and marketing headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue dropped in to from in recruiting  retention and training 
recruiting  retention and training expenses consist of compensation  benefits  and travel costs for personnel engaged in human resources  costs to recruit new employees  costs of human resources programs  and training costs 
recruiting  retention and training expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in spending is due primarily to more recruiting costs due to the increase in the number of personnel recruited and the reinstitution of formal training programs

management and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in for the year ended december   management and administrative expenses increased to as a percent of revenue from in the prior year period  as net revenue grew at a slower rate than management and administrative expenses 
this considerable increase in management and administrative expenses is mainly due to a one time charge of million related to a write off of office space 
in october inforte s executive team authorized a plan to reduce its office space to better align with its space needs 
the total reduction of office space resulting from this consolidation of our office space was approximately  square feet 
excluding this one time charge  total management and administrative expenses increased in compared to the year ended december  and that portion of the increase resulted from higher executive compensation spending in the months of as well as due to increased efforts to build the infrastructure supporting faster revenue growth 
our plan to set up and make fully functional our india location was successfully completed as of the end of the first quarter of in the third quarter of  we reversed  of previously recognized losses as we succeeded in subletting a portion of the abandoned office space  which had been initially regarded as unsuitable for sublease 
total management and administrative headcount was  and as of december   and  respectively 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease was due to the reinvestment of matured securities into similar type securities at lower market interest yields and also due to the lower average cash balance as a result of inforte s acquisition of compendit 
income tax expense 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was of pre tax loss versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in the unusually low effective tax rate in resulted from our reduction of income tax expense by  to account for an estimated reduction of income tax liabilities 
the effective tax rate of in approximates our blended statutory tax rate  reflecting immaterial permanent differences between taxable income for financial reporting and tax purposes 
years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue excludes reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this decline in net revenue to the slow growth rate of the us economy and the negative impact that economic uncertainty had on information technology it spending in these factors depressed the market for strategic technology services over the three years ending december  for the year ended december   we had significant clients with each of these clients contributing million to net revenue on average

all labor costs for project personnel are included in project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease results  in part  from reductions in consulting headcount 
we employed and consultants on december  and  respectively 
further  project personnel and related expenses were reduced both in and by a downward adjustment in the allowance for doubtful accounts which was  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the revised balances reflect more accurately our exposure to loss from non paying customers  due to an overall reduction in business activity 
the adjustments in both years were not due to any write off of a specific customer account 
project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is due to the higher use of subcontractors in in addition to an escalation in the non billable project related expenses 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   up from  in the year ended december  the slight change in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year is a result of the small increase in our effective hourly rate 
in june inforte offered a six to nine month voluntary leave of absence program and a voluntary resignation program to employees in underutilized areas 
approximately people participated in the programs 
individuals who selected the leave of absence program received compensation at of regular pay if they remained available to return to full time service 
salary costs for employees on leave of absence were expensed as incurred and included in the quarters ended september through june with the amounts declining in the later quarters 
in january  inforte offered again a voluntary program similar to the june program  however  these latter programs were smaller in scope  involving approximately people 
in the fourth quarter  inforte enacted a further headcount reduction program  affecting approximately individuals 
all costs for this program were expensed in fourth quarter there were no significant headcount reduction programs in the twelve months ended december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups and costs to execute marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease is due to lower headcount in this area  resulting in lower salary and benefit costs and a decrease in travel expense 
total sales and marketing headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue dropped in to from in recruiting  retention and training

recruiting  retention and training expenses decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in spending is due primarily to less training activity due to lower company wide headcount 
total employees declined from as of december  to as of december  to as of december  total recruiting  retention and training headcount was as of december   as of december  and in addition  in an economic environment of higher unemployment  recruiting efforts require fewer expenses  such as recruiting finder fees  signing bonuses  relocation allowances and employee referral bonuses to identify and attract qualified candidates

during most management and administrative areas had lower expenses relative to expense reductions related primarily to lower headcount and lower facilities costs 
total management and administrative headcount declined from as of december  to as of december  lease expense in was lower than lease expense in due to a write down to lease expense in of million necessitated by a downward revision in our initial estimate of sublease income due to a reduction in the rental price of office space 
in addition to that  in the third quarter on  we reversed  of previously recognized losses as we succeeded in subletting a portion of the abandoned office space  which had been initially regarded as unsuitable for sublease 
the initial charge in was determined based on future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease was due to the reinvestment of matured securities into similar type securities at lower market interest yields 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was of pre tax income versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in the decrease in the effective income tax rate results primarily from a reduction of income tax expense by  to account for a decline in certain estimates for nondeductible expenses and state and international income tax liabilities  offset in part by a drop in tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pretax book income 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  short term marketable securities decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  long term marketable securities decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities consisting of commercial paper  us government or municipal notes and bonds  corporate bonds and corporate auction preferreds 
in total  cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities decreased from million to million during the year ended december  during  inforte s cash flow from operations was negative million and capital expenditures were million  resulting in million of negative free cash flow cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures 
financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of million from employees participating in stock purchase and stock option plans 
in january  inforte announced that the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allows inforte to buy up to million of inforte shares 
the program was completed in august the board of directors approved an additional million stock repurchase program on august  we stated at that time that we had no present plans to make additional repurchases of stock  and as of december   we have made no repurchases under this second program 
on december   inforte had  shares outstanding and million in cash and marketable securities  resulting in of cash and marketable securities per basic share 
as of december   the public float shares not held by executive officers and directors totaled million shares or of total outstanding shares 
on march   by way of a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of inforte with compendit  inforte acquired all of the outstanding shares of compendit  a leading provider of sap business intelligence implementation consulting services  for initial cash consideration of million on closing 
an additional cash payment of million was paid in cash in may based on a closing statement calculation of cash less transaction costs 
a supplementary cash amount of million will be paid in two equal installments in january and in january inforte announced the payment of a one time cash distribution of per share of common stock 
the record date for inforte stockholders was set as the close of business on tuesday  april  it is anticipated that the cash distribution of approximately million will be paid to stockholders on or about friday  april  all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalent balances consist of obligations of us  us german and indian banks  high grade municipal and us government agencies bonds and other high quality  short term obligations of us companies 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities that are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
as of december   inforte had a total of up to million in deferred business acquisition obligations payable in cash in two equal installments in january and inforte believes that it will have sufficient funds to satisfy obligations related to the deferred consideration 
we expect to fund these contingent payments  primarily from the cash generated from the operations of the acquired business 
in addition to the purchase price obligation for the compendit acquisition  inforte assumed two operating leases from compendit  related to office space 
inforte has several operating leases that have contractual cash obligations for future payments 
there are no other contractual obligations that require future cash obligations or other commitments 
the table below identifies all future commitments 
payments due by period total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations inforte has several sublease agreements for unused office space located in chicago and irvine  california 
total rent receivable on these sublease contracts is    and  for the years   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than management reasonably could have used have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition  losses on fixed price contracts  deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence exists that we have an agreement  service has been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize net revenue from fixed price contracts based on the ratio of hours incurred to total estimated hours 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimated hours to complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
we recognize time and materials net revenue as we perform the services 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issued topic  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred stating these costs should be characterized as revenue in the income statement if billed to customers 
for each quarter beginning with the march  quarter  we included reimbursable expenses in revenue and expense and we have reclassified prior periods in the comparative consolidated financial statements as required by the financial accounting standards board 
this reclassification had no effect on current or previously reported net income loss per share 
for presentation purposes  we show two components of total revenue revenue before reimbursements  which we call net revenue  consisting of revenue for performing consulting services  and reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements we receive from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we believe net revenue is a more meaningful representation of our economic activity than total revenue since it excludes pass through  zero margin expense reimbursements 
financial instruments 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities which are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses 
the amount of the reserve is established analyzing all client accounts to determine credit risk 
in establishing a client s creditworthiness we consider whether the client has a deteriorating or poor financial condition  limited financial resources  poor or no payment history  a large relative accounts receivable balance or a non us location 
stock compensation 
at december   inforte has three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
we account for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas related to options issued to employees 
all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  except for the option grants related to the acquisition of compendit 
in january inforte announced a capital restructuring plan that included an offer to inforte s employees to convert certain outstanding stock options into restricted stock and to exchange certain other stock options for cash 
in the case where eligible employees elect to cancel their options and receive cash  inforte will recognize the related compensation expense at the time when the offer is made  february  on the date of the offer  february   the maximum cash settlement amount will be accrued as a liability 
for the options where the cash offer is accepted the liability will be settled with the cash payment 
if the offer is declined the liability will be reversed with a credit to equity 
in the alternative case when employees elect to cancel their options and receive restricted stock  the total non cash compensation expense would be expensed ratably over a four year period 
this amount would be expensed over four years because the stock vests over a four year period  starting in the first quarter of the options in this category will be subject to variable accounting treatment from the date of the offer until the offer is accepted 
those options for which the restricted stock offer is declined will be immediately vested and will continue to be subject to variable accounting treatment thereafter until those options are exercised or cancelled or expire unexercised or until after july  when we adopt sfas r 
variable accounting treatment means that the value of each option will be measured and adjusted each reporting period based on the intrinsic value of the option in the reporting period 
if employees choose not to exercise vested options with a strike price less than prior to the special one time cash distribution record date  these employees will receive common stock to compensate for the estimated loss in option value due to the one time distribution 
please note that these options are not part of this offer 
bonus accruals 
we have several bonus programs that are based on individual and company performance 
revenue bonuses are earned based on individual or roll up revenue credit assigned to salespeople  client executives  other senior delivery personnel and senior management 
margin bonuses are earned by all employees based on company or business unit operating income performance 
in addition  senior management may award discretionary bonuses 
all of these bonuses are expensed in the period in which they are earned 
a corresponding accrual is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses until the bonus is paid 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis december for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates regarding contractual rental commitments  lease buy out and related costs for office space being vacated and leasehold improvement write offs 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our sub lease assumptions and space requirements may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if any future adjustments are required to the restructuring initiatives recorded under the provisions of eitf  such adjustments will be measured in accordance with eitf sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
in october  inforte s executive team authorized a plan to reduce its office space to better align with its space needs 
these steps included consolidating office space at its southern california office and the two chicago locations where inforte had separate contractual rental obligations 
estimated costs for the consolidation of the facilities consist of contractual rental commitments for office space being vacated less estimated sub lease income 
the total reduction of office space resulting from this consolidation of our office space was approximately  square feet  all of which was vacated as of october  total charges related to this reduction of space were million and were recognized at the date the plan for office space consolidation was executed 
if we vacate additional space  if future sub lease income is less than estimated  if we buy out of leases or if we are unable to sub lease our vacated space  additional charges or credits in future periods will be necessary 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact the our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  inforte expects to adopt sfas no 
r on july   using the statement s modified prospective application method 
adoption of sfas no 
r will not affect inforte s cash flows or financial position  but it will reduce reported income and earnings per share because inforte currently uses the intrinsic value method as permitted by accounting public board opinion no 
accordingly  no compensation expense is currently recognized for share purchase rights granted under the company s employee stock option and employee share purchase plans 
specifically  adopting sfas no 
r will result in inforte recording compensation cost for employee stock options and restricted stock grants 
we continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r could have on our statements of cash flows 
subsequent events on january  inforte announced in a press release and a form k that its board of directors had approved a capital restructuring plan that included a special one time cash distribution of per share and a program to offer employees  with respect to certain stock options  the opportunity to convert stock options to restricted stock or to cash out stock options 
on march  inforte completed its offer to exchange options for cash or restricted stock 
 options were exchanged for a total consideration of  and  options were exchanged for  shares of restricted stock 
on the same day  inforte announced that the record date for inforte stockholders for the previously declared special one time cash distribution of per share of common stock will be the close of business on tuesday  april  it is anticipated that the cash distribution will be paid to stockholders on or about friday  april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk during  our international revenues were over of our total net revenue 
we face additional risks internationally that we do not face domestically 
such risks include longer customer payment cycles  adverse taxes and compliance with local laws and regulations 
further  the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the results of operations 
interest rate risk as of december  inforte s total short term and long term marketable securities equaled million 
during  interest income represented of inforte s pre tax income  excluding the one time charge of million related to the office space write off 
as a result  fluctuations in interest rates can have a significant impact on our net income loss per share 
we estimate that the impact on interest income from a percentage point change in interest rates could change our annual net income loss per share by approximately per diluted share 
our estimate is calculated using investment balances as of december  and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year then ended
