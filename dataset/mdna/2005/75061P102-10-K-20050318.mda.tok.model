item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
in some cases  readers can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  could  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from those stated herein 
although management believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  performance  or achievements 
for further information  refer to the section entitled factors that may affect future results in this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global developer and manufacturer of rapidly deployable  multi sensor chemical detection monitors and networks for homeland security and industrial applications 
in addition  we offer a full line of portable single sensor chemical and radiation detection products 
we were founded in to develop technologies for the detection and early warning of hazardous materials 
the market for our products has evolved from being strictly focused on environmental and industrial monitoring to now encompassing public safety and the threat of terrorism 
in may  we invested million in cash for a interest in klh  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of security  environmental and personal safety monitors and equipment 
as a result  our sales into the china market increased from in to in the sales from our rae systems business less sales 
table of contents from klh base business in the united states  europe and asia continued to grow  primarily from the sales of our patented pid products as well as our integrated wireless technology 
sales from our base business contributed million in as compared to million in  an increase of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  warranty costs  contingencies and taxes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated product returns is established at the time of sale based upon historical return rates adjusted for current economic conditions 
historically  the company has experienced an insignificant amount of sales returns 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment to its distributors in accordance with standard contract terms that pass title to all goods upon delivery to a common carrier fob factory and provides for sales returns under standard product warranty provisions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated credit losses at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowance is based on reviews of loss  adjustments history  current economic conditions and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts receivable is also dependent upon future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness  or if actual defaults were higher than what has been experienced historically  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be overstated and our operating results could be adversely affected 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost moving weighted average method or market 
inventory purchases are typically based on estimated future demand 
in the event of a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher occurrence of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances 
we generally provide a one to three year limited warranty on the majority of our products and establish the estimated costs of fulfilling these warranty obligations at the time the related revenue is recorded 
historically  warranty costs have been insignificant 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared to our historical experience  or costs of servicing warranty claims were greater than expectations on which the warranty reserve has been based  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we recognize deferred tax assets future tax benefits and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences  which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
we are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when 
table of contents management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
for stock based employee compensation effective january   under the modified prospective method as provided for in sfas no 
we consolidate all investments in which we have a controlling financial interest to comply with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r 
we also consolidate investments where we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion analyzes our disclosure to market risk related to concentration of credit risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
concentration of credit risk currently  we have cash and cash equivalents deposited with two large united states financial institutions  one large hong kong financial institution  two large shanghai financial institutions  two local beijing financial institutions  and one large danish financial institution 
our deposits may exceed the amount of insurance available to cover such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses of deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
management regularly reviews our deposit amounts and the credit worthiness of the financial institution which hold our deposits 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting of cash and highly liquid short term investments 
the impact of interest rate fluctuations was immaterial 
changes to interest rates over time may  however  reduce or increase our interest income from our short term investments 
if  for example  there is a hypothetical bps change in the interest rates in the united states  the approximate impact on our cash and short term investments would be  foreign currency exchange rate risk to date  a substantial portion of our recognized revenue has been denominated in united states dollars generated primarily from customers in the united states 
revenue generated from our european operations is primarily in euros  revenue generated by our china operations is in renminbi  and revenue generated from our hong kong based operations is in both hong kong dollars and united states dollars 
we manufacture a majority of our component parts at our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
our operations in china have been largely unaffected by currency fluctuations  as china s currency rate has been fixed relative to the united states dollar 
our strategy has been and will continue to be to increase our overseas manufacturing and research and development activities to capitalize on low cost intellectual property and efficiency in supply chain management 
in  we made a strategic investment in china with the acquisition of klh  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of environmental safety and security equipment 
there has been recent speculation in the financial press that china s currency  the renminbi  will be subject to a market adjustment relative to the united states dollar and other currencies 
if  for example  there is a hypothetical change in the renminbi relative to the united states dollar  the approximate impact on our profits would be  furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars in countries other than china  any fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could affect our competitive position in the international markets 
although we would continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be certain that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
