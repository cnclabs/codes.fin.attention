item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary the year was both a pivotal and transitional year for maine maritimes corporation 
it marked the first full year of existence of the holding company  mam  and implementation of its growth and diversification strategy 
during the year  earnings were significantly impacted by a number of regulatory  restructuring and business start up issues 
consolidated earnings declined to per share 
on a segment basis  mps s earnings were million or approximately per share  as compared to the previous year of million or per share 
overall electric consumption was up by almost  megawatt hours with slight increases in all customer classes with the exception of small commercial 
although mps s revenues were up as compared to  total operations and maintenance expenses and stranded costs expenses increased by approximately million and 
million respectively 
mps s expense increases were impacted by factors  such as but not necessarily limited to a regulatory and related legal and consulting costs associated with rate cases before the mpuc and ferc  b increases associated with the implementation of mps s oracle based financial information system  and c cost of employee medical and pension benefits 
costs allocated to mps by its parent company  mam  for services  such as sarbanes oxley compliance  legal and audit services and corporate governance totaled million in  as compared to 
million for the last six months of these and other allocated costs would have been fully borne by mps prior to the formation of mam as a holding company 
consequently  mps benefited by sharing in the costs of certain administrative and general expenses at the holding company level with its affiliated unregulated mam subsidiaries 
overall  mps s performance reflects only a small growth rate in revenues  only slightly greater than one half a percent 
costs  particularly those which are more difficult to manage or control  such as regulatory  sarbanes oxley compliance and overall accounting related costs  and employee health and pension benefits  will in all probability continue to impact mps s earnings 
management believes that mps s earnings would have been reduced further in had certain holding costs that were fully borne by mps in the past had not been allocated to unregulated mam subsidiaries 
there is a certain critical mass of personnel and effort required to manage  operate  and maintain an electric transmission and distribution system 
management continues to evaluate means to control or reduce costs such as productivity enhancements 
however  we believe that current cost structures within mps are at or near the required critical mass level 
as stranded costs decline  the regulated utilities earnings will decline over time 
the regulated utility is allowed to receive up to return on a maximum of and a minimum of equity of its total rate base 
stranded costs are a significant portion of mps s overall rate base and will decline  particularly between through consequently  mam has instituted a growth strategy to attempt to offset reductions in mps s rate base and declining earnings and grow overall shareholder value 
in mps s stranded cost case before the mpuc  it was determined that mps had not previously recognized accumulated deferred income taxes with respect to the carrying charges on its stranded cost deferred fuel account 
consequently  during the period from  mps over collected in its stranded cost recovery 
as a result  it was agreed that mps s return on its deferred stranded cost fuel balance would be reduced in such a manner that ratepayers would not pay on a net present value basis and amount greater than the total owed to 
table of contents mps 
as a result of required adjustments  mps s net income was negatively impacted in by 
million or approximately per share and will continue to be impacted through the projected and estimated negative impact on earnings will range from approximately million in  increasing to million in  then gradually declining to  in mam results for were further impacted by a number of issues 
as a result of management s decision to close energy atlantic due to its risk profile as a competitive retail energy provider  an approximate per share loss was experienced 
the loss was attributable to the termination of employees and the termination of certain lease agreements 
additional costs associated with employee terminations were approximately per share 
governance and compliance related to the sarbanes oxley act increased to approximately per share 
we anticipate such costs to increase during the next several years 
a loss of approximately per share was experienced by the maricor group and its canadian subsidiary  the maricor group  canada ltd 
included in the approximate per share loss were non capitalized internal acquisition and integration costs  as well as allocated corporate costs from mam for which the majority would have been historically borne by mps 
in order to ensure improving profitability of the maricor group and its subsidiaries  it is important that these companies improve their overall market penetration  increase sales  and increase their overall scale of their operations 
on a divisional basis  the maricor group s eastcan division  which was the first engineering company acquired in late  contributed per share 
other companies acquired in included the morris richard division  which lost approximately per share and res engineering  inc which lost approximately  the overall losses at the maricor group and the maricor group  canada ltd levels were attributable to corporate allocations  costs associated with business development and labor costs associated with the maricor group s corporate staff 
management continues to take steps to improve the profitability of the maricor group and its subsidiaries 
these actions include  but are not necessarily limited to  increasing its focus on sales activities  increasing staffing to billable consulting engineering talent  and decreasing subsidiary corporate costs 
management believes that increasing the overall scale of the maricor group through the addition of engineering talent and increased sales  as well as additional acquisitions are critical to the long term profitability of the maricor group 
the long term success of the maricor group will be dependent upon a number of factors including  but not necessarily limited to a increasing overall scale and market penetration through acquisitions and improved marketing and sales  b the availability and retention of key engineering talent  c improved efforts related to asset development projects  and d increased sales in higher value products and services associated with asset lifecycle management 
losses of approximately per share were associated with start up and corporate allocation costs of maricor properties ltd and mecel properties ltd 
management believes that improved profitability will be dependent upon efforts to fully lease existing real estate  as well as increasing investments in real properties 
renovations of maricor properties ltd s primary real estate asset was not complete until november  efforts continue to fully lease the facility 
as a new start up mam subsidiary in  scale is believed to be an important issue for continued growth and profitability of maricor properties ltd 
due to the deferral and levelizing of stranded cost recovery over an extended period  mps s cash flows will be negatively impacted through consequently  mam and mps may experience cash flow challenges during the near term 
such cash flow short falls may result in increased short term borrowings by mps to bridge the deferral of stranded cost collections 
in addition  due to the decline in mps s projected earnings as a result of the stranded cost rate case referenced above  mps s earnings will be less than earlier projected between now and mam s growth strategy revolves around people  processes  assets and technologies that relate to energy and facilities infrastructure 
through its engineering subsidiaries  it is focused on the provision of mechanical  electrical  plumbing and fire protection services for buildings  and increasingly focused on more sustainable engineering services related to leadership in energy and environmental design leed engineering certifications 
to complement our engineering market strategy  maricor technologies provides software solutions that support more sustainable management and capital planning for infrastructure assets  particularly buildings 
maricor properties focuses on real estate assets and projects involving the urban revitalization of downtown centers using the expertise of the maricor group and its engineering subsidiaries 

table of contents a key to mam s overall growth strategy will be its ability to raise the necessary capital to fully implement its strategy and achieve a necessary scale of operations  while ensuring the adequacy of short term cash flows for operational purposes 
management believes it can raise the necessary short term and investment capital  but there are no assurances that it can do so 
general the company begins this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation with an overview of the company  its regulated and unregulated business operations  strategies and challenges 
we then provide a discussion of certain critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated into our reported financial results 
finally we present a more detailed analysis of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
this management s discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements  as defined by the sec  such as forecasts and projections of expected future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in filings with the sec and in press releases and oral statements

overview of company and strategy mam  a maine corporation  became a holding company effective june   and owns all of the common stock of mps 
all of the shares of mps common stock were converted on the books into an equal number of shares of mam common stock  which are listed on the amex under the trading symbol mam 
prior to electric retail deregulation within the state of maine and its divestiture of generation  mps served as a regulated and vertically integrated electric utility 
as a result of deregulation and generation divestiture  mps s revenue model and rate base underwent significant change 
today  mps s returns are based on specifically allowable rates of return  as permitted by the mpuc and the ferc on various physical and regulatory assets  referred to as mps s rate base 
while rates of return may remain more stable  should the overall rate base decline  then earnings will also decline 
mps s current rate base consists primarily of transmission and distribution networks poles  wires  substations buildings and rolling stock  as well as regulatory assets that include stranded costs associated with the sale of generation  closure of generation and or purchase power agreements 
mps s primary regulatory asset or stranded cost is associated with the wheelabrator sherman nug contract  more fully described within this form k see item above  business  discussion and description of the company s growth strategy  and description of mps and maine new brunswick electrical power company  ltd 
in the case of 
table of contents the ws stranded cost  the amount of stranded cost upon which mps receives a return is based on the difference between the actual contract price and the bid price for the facilities output received through a bid process overseen by the mpuc on a periodic basis 
the wheelabrator sherman nug contract expires in late however  mps chose to levelize its stranded cost payments from consumers  such that the recovery of stranded costs would be equal over a longer period of time  as opposed to higher consumer costs over a shorter recovery period  declining on an annualized basis 
consequently  the full recovery of ws related stranded costs will not occur until  although payments to ws cease beginning in as stranded costs decline  absolute returns will also decline as the rate base is reduced 
during the period from through  mps anticipates strong stranded cost freed up cash flows as a result of the end of the above market contract with ws and having levelized its stranded costs 
the deferment of stranded costs impacts stranded cost freed up cash flows  but will not impact net income 
due to mps s declining rate base as a result of deregulation  generation divestiture and amortization of stranded costs  combined with current stranded cost freed up cash flows forecasts during the period noted  management and the board of directors of mps determined that now is an opportune time to grow and diversify mps 
as a part of the overall strategy to grow  as noted  mam was formed as the holding company for mps and other subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
based on covenants agreed to between mps and the mpuc in forming the holding company  restrictions were placed on mam as it relates to the financial management of mps  helping to insulate the regulated utility from possible detrimental impacts of deregulated companies and diversification and vice versa 
these covenants are described in greater detail at the end of the capital resources section below 
mam s overall growth strategy  as presented in item and incorporated herein by reference  consists of the following proposed regulated and unregulated strategic and tactical actions  increasingly focusing on principles of sustainability regulated business strategic activities improve the overall operation and economic viability of mps improve the effectiveness of mps s operations  ensuring its continued contribution to overall mam earnings and ensuring increased effectiveness of capital deployment based on return on capital employed roce evaluations 
improve overall mps transmission system security through the development of increased total and available transmission capacities  deploying capital for new construction based on a ferc allowed rate of return basis 
deploy capital based on the development and implementation of comprehensive year transmission and distribution system plans that seek to optimize reliability  while reducing required infrastructure 
implement integrated asset management systems and processes to improve overall transmission and distribution system reliability and extend assets lifecycles 
improve overall management of mps through improved skill sets  business processes and systems  including the installation of a new financial system with utility enterprise management components 
increase the overall integration and application of technologies and specialty equipment to achieve increased productivity  such as installation of automated meter reading devices 
monitor rates to ensure mps s rates are fully compensatory and allow for achievement of allowable rates of return on equity  requesting rate increases as required from regulatory bodies  migrating to an alternative rate program based on performance based rates 
continue the ongoing evaluation of potential regulated utility acquisitions to leverage scale and synergies related to mam s ownership of mps  such as billing  credit collection and remittance services  information technology services  
table of contents engineering services  administrative and accounting services  call center operations  scada operations  and human resource related services 
beyond the impacts of electric retail deregulation and generation divestiture  management closely monitors legislative activities and regulations 
both regulatory and legislative risks are the major risk concerns impacting mps 
management believes that as unregulated energy commodity prices increase  increased pressures will be placed on regulated distribution costs 
management anticipates that scale and technology will be the driving forces impacting the long term view of distribution and transmission assets 
accordingly  management has concluded that instituting productivity enhancing technologies and acquiring additional businesses that utilize common and scalable services can create synergies that achieve improved economics  such as managing operating costs and lowering per unit of utilization capital costs 
in order to enhance overall financial management capabilities  to improve operational efficiencies  and to assist in the achievement of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  mam  through its subsidiary mps  has implemented a financial system  which includes a utility enterprise management suite 
mps s ongoing refinement of its financial accounting system should provide for improved financial and management reporting  along with supporting efforts which are fully compliant with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
institution of an accounting system has and will cause overall financial accounting system costs to increase 
however  as part of the refinements of the financial accounting system  mps will evaluate  develop and or refine business processes that should enhance overall productivity 
efforts to refine mps s accounting system are ongoing 
although mps is prohibited  except under certain  very limited regulatory exceptions  from owning and operating electric generation  management continues to closely evaluate generation resource conditions within northern maine and the canadian maritimes control area 
management believes that peaking capacity may be a significant problem within the region and that this problem is currently exacerbated by uncertainties concerning the future and cost of orimulsion fuel supplies to generation facilities within new brunswick  canada  the increasing cost of oil  the future of the point lepreau nuclear generation station also in new brunswick  canada  and other factors 
given these and other multi national issues  policies  and decisions that impact generation supply planning and adequacy  management is concerned about the uncertainties relative to generation resources availability and the potential impact such uncertainties may have on mps s  and the company s future operations 
to address these resource availability concerns  mps is  among other things  proposing to construct an additional  new transmission interconnection that could potentially increase its overall total and available transmission capacities with nb power 
mps has filed a petition with the mpuc requesting permission to construct a new kv transmission line interconnecting with nb power 
while mps believes this additional interconnection is important and the proper response to generation supply challenges  it also believes that maximum benefit can only be derived from approval of an additional kv transmission project  currently jointly proposed by nb power and bangor hydro electric company  that would among other things provide an additional interconnection of nb power s system with the new england iso 
in this regard  should the line be constructed in both the us and canada  mps is proposing before the mpuc to secure a mw reservation 
management believes that certain distributed technologies may hold near to long term potential for customers to bypass transmission and or distribution 
while we do not believe this threat is imminent  technologies  such as fuel cells  micro turbines  and co generation projects may ultimately challenge all regulated transmission and distribution monopolies 
mps attempts to address the potential loss of large industrial customers by signing long term discounted contracts 
unregulated business strategic activities mam has established its planned platform  unregulated subsidiary companies to serve as the foundation for the company s future growth 
these companies consist of start up firms and acquisition of established 
table of contents businesses 
while the majority of the company s unregulated growth strategy did not begin until mid  it is critical that these subsidiaries migrate through the integration and start up phases  achieving profitability in a rational fashion 
achieving profitability requires that subsidiaries cover their share of corporate costs 
such corporate cost allocations which include information technology  human resources and accounting costs reduce  in most cases  the operating costs of mam s regulated subsidiaries 
covering corporate allocation costs on a segment basis will require unregulated subsidiaries to increase their scale of operations 
due  among other things  to the lack of sustainable profitability of ea and its risk profile  mam has ceased the marketing of competitive retail electric energy within maine 
while mam has retained ea as a subsidiary for the near term  it is highly doubtful that ea will re enter the competitive retail electric energy supply market 
however  management will continue to monitor the market  credit requirements  and the overall wholesale market should conditions become favorable for re entry 
both the ability to raise the necessary capital and the availability of adequate investment capital to allow for full implementation of the mam strategic vision are critical success factors 
mam continues to evaluate a number of financing options  including the possible monetization or securitization of the above described mps stranded cost freed up cash flows see item above  business  discussion and description of the company s growth strategy resulting from deferred stranded cost recovery 
such a technique may require regulatory and or legislative approvals 
other options for financing may include  but are not limited to  the issuance of additional shares of stock  either common or preferred  senior debt  convertible debt  venture capital  joint ventures  economic development funding and various other forms of capital formation 
certain capital formation strategies  such as convertible debt or the private placement of stock offerings can result in the dilution of the outstanding stock 
should mam undertake any of these or other forms of capital formation  it cannot warrant that such efforts will not be dilutive 
beyond issues related to capital formation  management anticipates that the effectiveness of mam s strategic vision and acquisition strategy will be greatly dependent upon the availability and quality of market opportunities  both in terms of demand for its products and services and the availability of quality acquisitions 
since its acquisition of firms within new england and atlantic canada  management believes that it should expand the market under consideration to include all of canada and northern reaches of the united states 
further  while regionally focused on certain business offerings  mam anticipates that it will be required to market throughout north america 
management believes there are significant opportunities for development and investment in canada 
existing operations the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial results of mam and its subsidiaries mps  its electric transmission and distribution delivery company  and its wholly owned  inactive canadian subsidiary  me nb  ea  its inactive ces retail electric marketing company  the maricor group  its canadian subsidiary  the maricor group  canada ltd  and its us subsidiary res engineering  inc  which provide mechanical and electrical consulting design engineering services  energy efficiency  air emissions reduction  energy asset development  and or facility lifecycle asset management services with a focus on sustainability and leed certified engineers  maricor properties ltd and its canadian subsidiary  mecel properties ltd  which serve as real estate investment  development and redevelopment companies 
mps is an electric transmission and distribution delivery company serving approximately  retail electric customers in northern maine 
mps is subject to the regulatory authority of the mpuc for its distribution rates and the ferc for its transmission rates 
current rates are determined using traditional rate base  and rate of return ratemaking principals  including a cost of service methodology  used by the regulatory agencies 
other investor owned electric utilities within the state of maine are under alternative rate plans arp s and utilize performance based rates pbr s 
mps continues to evaluate the merits of an arp and possible migration to 
table of contents pbr s 
see part i  item a  legal proceedings above 
however  management believes that implementation of pbr s under an arp could result in detrimental financial impacts  due to the lack of growth within mps s service area 
typically  arp s with pbr s require productivity offsets to achieve allowed rates of return and management believes such productivity offsets will not be achievable in the absence of economic growth 
maine new brunswick electrical power company  ltd 
is currently an inactive subsidiary of mps and was the former owner of mps s hydro generation assets in canada 
energy atlantic  llc  an inactive subsidiary of mam  was involved in the competitive retail electric energy market within the state of maine

discussion and description of the company s growth strategy mam s growth strategy centers on a diversification approach that expands the company s business and revenue model to include  without limitation  facilities infrastructure mechanical and electrical engineering 
table of contents services  energy efficiency and reliability solutions  air emissions reductions through enhanced energy efficiency solutions  facility lifecycle asset management solutions and services  energy management  and energy asset and real estate asset development and ownership 
given the increasing emphasis of the kyoto protocol within canada  combined with increasing cost and security issues associated with energy  as well as the upwardly spiraling impact of deferred maintenance liabilities among government facilities  such as hospitals  schools  municipalities  and hospitals  mam believes that converging economic  energy and environmental factors provide significant opportunities for the company 
in summary  mam s engineering  technology and real estate development diversification activities focus on sustainable practices that support smart growth initiatives  as well as leed criteria 
the acquisition of three engineering firms during the last quarter of  and the second quarter of  was part of the company s continuing acquisition strategy 
within this strategy  the company is seeking to acquire and grow mechanical and electrical engineering firms  utilizing these platform engineering services to expand the maricor group s asset development  facility lifecycle asset management  energy efficiency and emissions reductions business activities within eastern canada  new england and potentially in other north american regions  focusing increasingly on sustainability solutions 
efforts continue to target sustainable engineering firms for acquisition  with the ultimate goal of becoming north america s leading sustainable engineering firm 
fundamentally  mam sees the concentration of sustainable engineering talent within north america as a compelling value proposition with potential to enhance overall shareholder value 
the creation of maricor properties ltd and the acquisitions of mecel properties ltd in the second quarter of and the vaughan harvey property in the third quarter of were the first steps in the company s real estate development and investment strategy 
the company believes that revitalization of real properties will be a critical issue for communities throughout its market region and that the ability to redevelop or develop real estate using smart growth and environmentally friendly land use and construction techniques will be a growing market 
maricor properties ltd continues to evaluate potential facility acquisitions  redevelopment and development projects  as well as real estate portfolio acquisitions 
the services of the maricor group and its subsidiaries have been and will be utilized to achieve maricor properties ltd s strategic objectives 
while significant progress in implementing mam s growth strategy has been achieved since it became a holding company on june   the company continues to identify and evaluate a diverse array of opportunities for integration into its subsidiary operations 
although we believe our strategy and acquisitions will create additional long term shareholder value  the company cannot assure these initiatives will be successful 
mam s proposed overall growth strategy will be heavily influenced by the company s ability to identify and acquire additional asset and business acquisition targets that meet certain desired strategic and financial criteria 
in addition  management believes that future success will be dependent upon their ability to rapidly integrate acquisitions and achieve profitability within a reasonable timeframe 
continued successful implementation of the defined strategy is dependent upon  among other things  mam s and its subsidiaries ability to raise sufficient capital  attract and retain key management and staff talent  and the availability of market based opportunities 
mam believes it can raise the necessary capital and retain key management and staff talent to implement the strategy  but cannot assure investors of this ability 
with the us dollar near historic lows against major currencies  including the canadian currency  mam has experienced an increased value on its foreign assets and cash flows in us dollar terms 
should the us dollar strengthen compared to the canadian dollar  then mam s value of foreign assets would decline 
managing currency and investment risks are a key and requisite element of mam s financial and growth strategy 
however  management cannot warrant that fluctuations in currency values will not impact the company 
management does evaluate currency risk management options and may  should it be deemed advantageous  utilize various currency risk management tools  such as term forwards  rolling forwards  cross currency swaps and foreign debt issuance 
given mps s historical decision to a levelize stranded costs  which will negatively impact cash flow until  as well as b the estimated reduction in mps s net income as a result of a stipulated reduction on its deferred stranded cost recovery  c the lagging economy of mps s service area  d increasing costs associated with employee benefits  e the impact of maine s deregulation of electric utilities impacting mps s revenue 
table of contents model  f increasing costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  and g other factors  management believes growth is essential to gain efficient scale  revenues  and earnings to ensure long term shareholder value 
although management is focused on efforts to control costs  as a micro cap publicly traded company  management does not believe cost reductions alone can address the company s need to ensure sustainable shareholder value 
consequently  the company is implementing its growth strategy 
management challenges and concerns a number of challenges and concerns have been identified herein  such as  but not necessarily limited to a the adequacy and availability of growth capital  b the recruitment and retention of key talent  c foreign currency risks  d the adequacy and availability of attractive acquisition targets  e legislative and regulatory risks  and f speed effectiveness of integration of acquisitions 
primary near term concerns involve short term cash flow challenges created as a result of deferring stranded cost collections  the need to decrease aging receivables associated with the company s unregulated engineering companies  the pace of required growth to achieve necessary scale  and the speed to profitability of unregulated subsidiaries 
recognizing these challenges  management is undertaking steps to address these issues 
however  the company cannot warrant that solutions to these challenges will be determined and or implemented in a timely manner 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies include the determination of the appropriate accounting for its pensions and other post retirement benefits  the recognition of its revenues  the effects of utility regulation on its financial statements and its risk management activities 
regulatory assets and liabilities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company capitalizes  as regulatory assets  incurred and accrued costs that are probable of recovery in future electric rates 
it also records  as regulatory liabilities  obligations to refund previously collected revenue or to spend revenue collected from customers on future costs 
unfunded future income taxes and deferred income taxes are amortized as the related temporary differences reverse 
unamortized loss on debt re acquisitions is amortized over the lives of the related debt issues 
nuclear plant obligations  demand side management program costs  gain on sale of generation assets  other regulatory assets and other regulatory liabilities are amortized over various periods in accordance with mps s current rate plans 
mps earns a return on substantially all regulatory assets for which funds have been spent 
the company believes that mps s electric transmission and distribution operations continue to meet the requirements of sfas  and that regulatory assets associated with those operations  as well as any generation related costs that the mpuc has determined to be recoverable from ratepayers  also meet the criteria 
at december   million of regulatory assets remained on mps s books 
these assets will be amortized over various periods in accordance with mpuc approved rate orders 
revenue recognition mps records an estimate for revenue for electricity delivered  but not yet billed to customers 
this estimate requires mps to make certain assumptions 
a change in those assumptions could cause the amounts reported as revenues to change 
in july  mps began recording the difference between the approved tariff rate for two large industrial customers and their current special discount rates  under contracts approved by the mpuc  as accrued revenue 
the resulting deferred asset will be subsequently collected in rates as approved by the mpuc 
during and   was recognized as stranded costs 
during   was recognized as revenue as flexible pricing adjustments 
the mpuc approved a third special discount during in docket 
table of contents ea s previous sales can be classified into two general categories sos in cmp s service territory which expired february   and ces sales to individual retail customers within the state of maine  all of which expired by february  for sos  revenues were received and expenses were paid directly by an escrow agent which was controlled by engage energy america  llc engage 
ea received a percentage of the net profit from the sale of energy 
cmp bore sos account collection risks  as they were required to remit the amounts billed days after the billing date to the escrow account mentioned above and maintain the billing and customer service relationship 
ea recorded the accrued net margin of the sos activity as revenue in the financial statements 
for ces sales  ea negotiated the price directly with the customer  maintained customer service responsibility and had collection risk 
ea has withdrawn from the market and no longer serves ces or sos customers 
ces activity is recorded on a gross basis to include the related revenues and purchased power expenses 
additionally  ea s activity has been accounted for as non trading since management has determined it does not meet the definition of a trader as defined in eitf which was amended by eitf refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations energy atlantic for further discussion 
method of accounting for the maricor group contracts revenues and profits from the maricor group s engineering contracts are recognized on a percentage completed basis for the period 
the percentage completed is computed by the cost to cost method 
costs incurred to date are divided by total estimated costs to obtain the percentage completed 
this percentage multiplied by the total estimated profit is the gross profit earned to date on the contract 
gross profit earned to date on the contract plus costs incurred to date on the contract equals revenues recognized to date 
revenue recognized to date compared to billings to date results in either under or over billings 
losses on contracts are recognized in full if there is evidence that an overall loss will be sustained 
when contract costs are expected to exceed revenue  thus creating an anticipated loss  a provision for the loss is made as soon as it becomes evident 
the provision is computed on the basis of the total estimated cost to complete the contract and reflects all elements of costs included in contract costs costs incurred on approved change orders are treated as job costs for that particular job 
costs incurred on unapproved change orders are treated as costs in the period in which they are incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price  the costs are deferred until there is an agreed upon change in the contract price 
in accordance with normal practice in the construction industry  the maricor group includes in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable over a period in excess of one year 
deferred contract revenue represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method on certain contracts
