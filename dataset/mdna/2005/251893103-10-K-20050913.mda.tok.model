item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
in fiscal year  devry inc continued its programmatic diversification with the introduction of more business and healthcare programs  expanding the company s position at the intersection of technology  business and healthcare education 
we also expanded our existing programs to new locations  opening seven new devry university centers and streamlined our operations to better position us for the future 
in march  the company completed the acquisition of deaconess college of nursing  which along with devry university undergraduate biomedical programs  adds to the company s strong presence in the rapidly growing field of healthcare 
in july  at the start of fiscal year  the company acquired gearty cpe  a provider of continuing professional education programs and seminars in accounting and finance  primarily in the new york new jersey metro area 
this acquisition allowed becker professional review to enter the continuing professional education marketplace 
devry undertook several workforce reductions to better match human resources to the changing demands of our business 
in addition  the company implemented a comprehensive growth plan  which is aimed primarily at devry university 
the focus of this plan is to improve recent financial results caused principally by declines in enrollment of full time technology program undergraduate students 
however  enrollments in business and management programs at devry university centers and devry university online continued to grow 
changes to our management structure during fiscal included creation of the position of vice president of new student recruitment at devry university  aimed at better focusing undergraduate student recruiting efforts 
also during fiscal  the company added a general manager to oversee all aspects of its growing online operations and moved much of the online sales and support functions from its corporate headquarters location to a nearby newly acquired facility to promote operational efficiency

revenues are reported net of tuition refunds applicable to students who withdraw from the academic term for which they are enrolled during the period specified by the refund policy 
revenues increased in the professional and training segment  medical and healthcare segment and in the keller graduate school of management operations of devry university 
however  lower devry university undergraduate enrollments for each of the three semesters that began during this fiscal year continued to affect overall financial results 
continued declines in full time technology enrollments  principally at the large campus locations  was the primary cause of decreased total enrollment 
further contributing to the decline in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was the completion of outsourcing of campus bookstore operations at devry university as discussed more fully below 
devry university in the devry university segment  revenues declined from fiscal by million  or 
within devry university  total graduate courses taken during the year increased by and tuition pricing was increased by approximately five percent effective with the term that began in january however  while total undergraduate enrollments continued to decline  enrollments in the undergraduate devry university center and online operations within devry university continued their growth 
enrollment growth at the university center and online operations  which are focused to serve working adult students interested primarily in the company s business programs  was not sufficient to offset declines in full time undergraduate enrollments at the large campuses whose primary focus has been recent high school graduates enrolled in technology based programs 
to reverse the pattern of declining technology and full time student enrollments  additional marketing efforts were initiated 
as a result of these additional marketing efforts  new undergraduate student enrollments in technology programs for spring declined by from the year ago period  a much lesser rate than the decline of vs 
prior year in the preceding fall 
for the summer  new technology program enrollments were only below those of a year ago  again reflecting the results of additional marketing efforts as the rate of decline in new technology enrollments continued to lessen 
for the spring of fiscal  new student undergraduate enrollment increased by from the prior year  following a decline of in new student enrollments for the preceding fall 
for the three semesters in fiscal  the company reported total undergraduate enrollments that were seven percent below those of a year ago  reflecting the continued effect of declines in new student enrollments during fiscal and the latter part of fiscal furthermore  a greater proportion of undergraduate students are now working adults who typically enroll for less than a full time academic load 
these part time students pay a somewhat lesser tuition amount each term than do full time students at the undergraduate campus locations 
therefore  the average tuition revenue per enrolled student has declined somewhat from previous years 
partially offsetting these declines was an approximately five percent tuition increase that became effective in november the previous tuition price increase  also approximately five percent  was implemented in march for the summer  which is the first term in the company s fiscal year  new devry university undergraduate student enrollments increased by from last year as enrollments in the devry university centers and online continued to increase 
however  total undergraduate enrollments remained below prior year levels  down by  from last summer 
this represents a lesser rate of decline in total enrollments when compared to the decline in total undergraduate enrollments in spring that was lower than in spring for the keller graduate school july session  total coursetakers increased by from the prior july to  also contributing to the decline in devry university revenues was the completion of the transition to outsource management of devry university campus bookstore and educational supply sales to follett higher education group follett 
during fiscal  the company completed an amended agreement with follett to undertake the management of the remaining nine devry university campus locations  completing the transition that began several years ago 
as a result of this transition  the company no longer reports sales revenue at its previously owned bookstores but reports instead the commission income it receives on the sales made by follett to devry university students 
accordingly  for fiscal  revenues from the sale of books and educational supplies at devry university declined by approximately million from last year  reflecting both the effects of lower student enrollments and completion of the outsourcing agreement 
although reported revenues have declined as noted above  there has been no significant effect on income as the commission earned from follett approximates the profits previously generated by the bookstores when they were under company management 
professional and training in the professional and training segment  revenues reached a record high  increasing by million  or from last year 
the increase in revenues this year is largely attributable to the sharp decline in revenues during the third quarter of last year at becker professional s cpa exam operations following the change in the cpa exam schedule and format 
this year  with the new format exam offered on a regular schedule in each quarter of the year  the number of exam takers and enrollments in the becker review course rebounded sharply from last year 
the change in the schedule of cpa exam administration also resulted in the realignment of the fiscal year for this business from its previous april year end to a june year end  consistent with the fiscal year end for the rest of the company 
this change in accounting was made effective with the first quarter of this fiscal year 
medical and healthcare the medical and healthcare segment revenues include ross university and the results of the deaconess college of nursing from its date of acquisition at the end of march with approximately students enrolled at the time of its acquisition  deaconess revenues for the final three months of the fiscal year were approximately million 
at ross medical and veterinary school operations  revenues increased by approximately million  or  largely as a result of a price increase of slightly less than eight percent implemented in january for the may semester  total enrollments at the medical and veterinary schools were  or below those of a year ago  as a result of changes to admissions standards for new students and increased satisfactory academic progress policies for continuing students 
revenue for the may term is recognized partly in fiscal and partly in the company s new fiscal year other educational revenue declined by million  or  from last year 
other educational revenue is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies in connection with the company s educational programs  including the commission income earned from follett 
also included is this category of revenue is the sale of becker cpa review course materials on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  application and other non refundable student fees and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the decrease in revenue from last year occurred because of the transition of the devry university bookstore operations to follett as described above 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances increased by million 
the increase is a result of both generally higher short term interest rates available for these investments and a greater use of cash balances for investment rather than for use in offsetting bank service fees as the company did in the previous year 
the company s cost of educational services increased by million  or  from last year 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff in support of educational operations 
faculty and related staff represent more than half of the costs in this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
throughout the year  the company maintained spending restraint and implemented cost reductions in areas that we believe did not affect the quality of student services 
however  there have been cost increases in support of the expanding number of devry university centers and growth in devry university online enrollments 
for example  in spring  courses were being taught at eight new devry university centers compared to the year ago period and the number of online course takers increased by from last year to  also included in the cost of educational services is approximately million of expense related to workforce reductions  principally at devry university  that were initiated during the year 
in addition  the company incurred an additional approximately million of workforce reduction costs under its agreement with rcc college of technology for the final phases of the teach out of the toronto area campus programs as described in more detail below 
additions to land  buildings and equipment during this fiscal year were million as the company continued its investment in new and improved laboratory and computer equipment  improvements to facilities for its students and staff and expansion of operations 
as a result  depreciation expense  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased to million 
in addition the company recognized a million pre tax impairment loss related to a company owned building in the denver  colorado area that was acquired in with the acquisition of denver technical college 
although still used partly as classrooms and offices  this facility is being offered for sale as it is no longer essential to the company operations in the denver area  having been largely replaced by a new and larger devry university campus serving the denver market 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or from last year 
included in this expense category are the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  expenses associated with curriculum development and the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions of businesses including  most recently  ross university and deaconess college of nursing 
amortization expense during fiscal included in this expense category was million compared to million last year 
the higher expense student services and administrative expense also reflects greater efforts to generate more new student enrollments through increased advertising and student recruiting for all of the company s educational programs  particularly the devry university undergraduate programs 
additional admissions advisors were added during the year at both devry university in support of its growing online operations and at ross university s medical and veterinary schools 
all new student recruitment expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
the company believes that reductions in technology field employment during the past several years has lessened applicant interest in these fields 
therefore  the company increased the level of recruitment activity to increase student enrollments  particularly at devry university 
the company believes that increased and more effective expenditures for new student recruitment were largely responsible for the increase in new undergraduate student enrollment for the spring semester of fiscal  which increased by from the previous year 
costs of student recruitment efforts for the summer of fiscal are included in the just completed fiscal for summer of fiscal  which is the first term of the new fiscal year  new student enrollments increased for the second consecutive semester  up from last year 
also contributing to the increase in student services and administrative expense is approximately million related to workforce reductions that were initiated during the year affecting employees whose wages were included in this expense category 
initial development work on the devry university new student information system has been largely completed and the system functionality deployed 
this new student information system provides better support for the educational processes and related student services 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting costs were capitalized 
indirect expenses  such as training and employee communications  were charged directly to expense as incurred 
during the year  approximately million was capitalized for this project 
with initial development work now nearly complete  no further amounts are being capitalized 
costs associated with further development and improvements to the system are being charged to expense as incurred 
cumulatively  a total of million was capitalized for this project 
all of the initial elements of the system have been placed into service and the capitalized costs are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  not exceeding five years 
for the year  a total of million of previously capitalized costs were amortized to expense 
these amounts compare to million that was capitalized during fiscal and million of previously capitalized costs that were amortized to expense 
in addition to the new student information system  the company undertook the implementation of a new budgeting and forecasting system this year to better manage the costs associated with the growing size and complexity of its operations 
during the year  approximately million of development costs were capitalized for this project 
one of the company s directors is also an investor in  and a director of  a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with system development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm during fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that  based upon current systems development activity  fees to be paid to this consulting firm in fiscal will be reduced from the level of fiscal devry university the devry university segment operating income of declined by almost from last year 
as discussed above  contributing to these lower earnings was million less revenue than last year resulting  in part  from reduced total undergraduate student enrollments in each of the summer  fall and spring terms this year and an increased proportion of part time students that each generate less tuition revenue than their full time counterparts had generated in previous years 
partly offsetting these reductions were higher enrollments at the keller graduate school and tuition price increases implemented during the year 
expenses associated with new student recruitment increased from last year as the company worked to overcome the declining undergraduate enrollments and incurred additional costs associated with new devry university operating locations 
in addition  growing online enrollments required us to add staff and facilities to support these operations 
workforce reduction costs  totaling approximately million and an asset impairment charge of approximately million related to the offering for sale of a denver area facility discussed above  also contributed to the increase in expense and lower earnings 
although spending on undergraduate campuses was curtailed as enrollments there continued to decline  significant fixed costs of operation  such as facility related costs  could not be reduced 
operating losses of approximately million in devry university s canadian operations  which include the operating losses associated with the final shutdown of the company s toronto area campus and teach out agreement with rcc  were approximately million higher than last year 
the company believes that almost all costs associated with this shutdown have been recognized and operating results in canada should improve in the future 
professional and training in the professional and training segment  operating income of million was a record high  more than doubling from last year 
in fiscal  the cpa exam format and schedule of exam offerings was changed  affecting exam candidates enrollment in the becker cpa review course 
with the new cpa exam format and schedule effective for the entire fiscal  enrollments and revenues rebounded 
effective with the beginning of fiscal year  the becker business cycle and fiscal year  which had previously ended in april to match the old cpa exam period  was changed to align with the june year end of devry inc with the current and nearly continuous exam administration schedule  the company believes that the historical becker operating year is no longer the most appropriate fiscal year end 
this change in accounting was implemented and reported in the first quarter of fiscal as a cumulative effect of change in accounting equal to million of after tax income  or approximately per share 
revenues and operating income for the professional and training segment in fiscal are reported for the same july through june period as the rest of the company 
in fiscal  revenues and operating income in this segment were reported for the period may through april medical and healthcare in the medical and healthcare segment  we acquired the deaconess college of nursing at the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year 
deaconess operations during the fourth quarter  while contributing approximately million of revenue  had no significant effect on the operating income of this segment  which increased by approximately million from last year 
although revenues increased  operating margins at ross university declined from last year to approximately in the current year  partly as a result of higher faculty wages and an increased number of faculty 
continued additions and improvements to facilities at both the medical and veterinary schools during the past two years have resulted in an increase to depreciation expense of almost million this year and is expected to increase still further in the coming year 
in response to the reduced enrollments in the last two terms of fiscal caused by changes in academic policies described above  ross increased its marketing support and added several additional admissions counselors  increasing student recruitment expense and contributing to the declining operating margin 
interest expense on the company s borrowings was million  an increase of million from last year 
borrowing levels throughout the year were generally lower than last year  but the interest rate on the company s borrowings is based upon short term interest rates  which increased significantly over that period 
for example  at june th  the interest rates on the company s senior notes was compared to one year ago 
taxes on income were of pretax income for the year compared to last year 
the lower effective tax rate this year reflects the greater proportion of ross university s earnings to the total company earnings 
earnings of ross university s offshore operations are not subject to us federal or state taxes and are also currently exempt from income taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
for the foreseeable future  the company intends to reinvest the ross university earnings and cash flow to reduce outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations at the schools  and pursue other business opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a current provision for the payment of us income taxes on these earnings 
fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  total consolidated revenues for fiscal set a new record  increasing by million  or  from the previous year 
approximately of the increase in revenue was generated by the ross university medical and veterinary school operations that the company acquired in may and were not included in fiscal results until the final six weeks of the year  from its mid may date of acquisition until june  tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from fiscal as with total revenues  most of the increase was generated by the ross university segment but the devry university segment also contributed to this increase 
tuition revenue is reported net of tuition refunds 
devry university revenues in the devry university segment increased by million  or from fiscal the increase is primarily the result of higher enrollments and higher tuition pricing at keller graduate school 
revenues at keller were higher than last year  in part  because of the july conversion in course length from ten weeks to eight weeks as the graduate program academic calendar was aligned with the devry university calendar 
this change in course length increased the number of terms each year from five to six  and correspondingly increased revenue by for the year assuming that all students proceeded through the year with continuous enrollment at the accelerated six term pace 
for fiscal  total graduate courses taken increased by more than as a result of the change in course length and higher student enrollments in each term 
revenues for the devry university segment also increased slightly from the prior year because of tuition price increases  in july and march  of approximately five to six percent each  partially offsetting lower total undergraduate enrollments 
undergraduate total student enrollments for the term that began in november were lower than last year and undergraduate total student enrollments for the term that began in march were lower than in the year earlier period 
although new student undergraduate enrollments in fiscal were higher than in the previous year in both of the final two terms of the year cited above  the increases have been in online programs and programs at devry university center locations that are designed to serve working adult students 
these students typically enroll for less than a full time academic load  and accordingly  they pay a somewhat lesser tuition amount than students at the undergraduate campus locations 
even though undergraduate enrollments in business programs continue to increase  the company believes that declines in enrollment in its technology programs at its campus locations have been caused by past reductions in technology field employment  which decreased applicant interest in these fields 
during fiscal year  a new undergraduate campus was opened in houston  texas  and several new devry university center locations were opened or expanded 
at the start of the summer term  which is the beginning of fiscal  graduate coursetakers increased from last year by to  however  total undergraduate enrollments in the summer term of fiscal of  remained below the level of the summer term of fiscal  declining by from  on a continuing operation basis  excluding the students at the mississauga toronto  canada  campus that did not accept new students after the summer term of fiscal  the decline in total enrollment from the summer of fiscal was 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett several years ago to manage some of the undergraduate on campus bookstores 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett are believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing campus bookstores 
sales at follett managed bookstores  net of commissions to devry university  were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  sales of books to students enrolled in online courses and at some devry university centers were managed by a different company under a similar commission agreement 
the company has entered into an agreement with follett to manage the remaining campus bookstores and its online and center book sales  with the transition occurring over several quarters in fiscal professional and training at becker professional review in the professional and training segment  revenues decreased from the previous year by more than million dollars 
effective with calendar year  the twice a year  paper and pencil cpa exam format is no longer being offered 
instead  the exam is now available on demand almost year round in a new computer based format 
candidates may choose to take the four exam sections individually and at different times 
while this provides greater flexibility for candidates sitting for the exam  it may extend the time over which exam candidates take review courses  such as those offered by becker and  therefore  extends the period over which review course revenue is earned 
the company also believes that some exam candidates delayed taking the new exam so as to benefit from the experiences of the first of the takers of the new format exam  thus reducing enrollments and revenues in the third and fourth quarter 
beginning with fiscal  the number of exam candidates did increase from the reduced levels experienced in the latter part of fiscal medical and healthcare ross university revenues were included in fiscal for the entire year 
in fiscal  ross university segment revenues were included only for the six week period from the date of its acquisition until the end of the fiscal year 
other educational revenue declined by million  or  from the prior year 
other educational revenue is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies in connection with the company s educational programs  including the becker cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  application and other non refundable fees and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the decrease in revenue from the year ago period occurred primarily in the devry university segment where lower undergraduate enrollments and a further outsourcing of book sales  as discussed more fully above  affected this source of revenue 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by million from fiscal the decrease is due to lower interest rates available on investments and the use of most cash balances to offset bank service fees rather than for short term investments 
the company s cost of educational services increased by million  or  from fiscal cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff that represents more than half of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
the increase in this expense category includes a full year of cost of operations at ross university that was not a part of the company for most of the previous fiscal year 
cost increases were incurred through all of the company s previously existing operations  and costs associated with new devry university centers  the undergraduate houston campus that opened in september and a growing online student enrollment requiring additional faculty and staff to support this growing method of delivery 
at the new devry undergraduate campuses in philadelphia and south florida that were opened in the first half of last fiscal year  additional faculty and staff are being hired as students progress into the higher terms of their educational programs 
for the keller graduate school term that began in may  courses were taught in seven new locations compared to the april term of may in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred charges of approximately million related to work force reductions in the eastern canada and us operations 
no such charges were incurred during fiscal however  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an approximately million pre tax loss from asset impairment on the furniture and laboratory equipment associated with the company s toronto area operations 
under its agreement with rcc college of technology for the teach out of the devry student programs that allows students to complete their program of study  this equipment may become the future property of rcc and will have no further useful life for devry beyond the period of the teach out 
additions to land  buildings and equipment were million in fiscal as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
as a result of these and previous years additions to facilities and equipment  depreciation expense  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased by million compared to the previous fiscal year  after increasing by million in fiscal from fiscal fiscal depreciation expense included a million pre tax impairment loss on long lived leasehold improvements in the company s canadian operations 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or from the prior year 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  expenses associated with curriculum development and the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions of businesses  including the acquisition of ross university 
amortization expense included in this expense category during fiscal was million compared to only million in fiscal the increase in expense also includes marketing and administration at ross university for a full year compared to just the six week period at the end of fiscal the increased expense in fiscal also reflects the higher advertising and selling costs associated with efforts to generate more new student enrollments  primarily in devry university s undergraduate educational programs 
the company believes that recent reductions in technology field employment decreased applicant interest in these fields  requiring the company to increase the level of its recruitment activity to maintain enrollments 
expenditures for new student recruitment are charged to expense as incurred 
the company believes that increased expenditures for new student recruitment were largely responsible for the increases in new undergraduate student enrollments for the past several terms 
for the undergraduate term that began in july  that is the start of the company s fiscal  new student undergraduate enrollments increased by from last year  excluding the final admission in july of new students to the now discontinued toronto area operations 
for the previous two undergraduate term that began in march and november  new student undergraduate enrollments increased by and  respectively  from the previous year in the final terms before new students were no longer being accepted in toronto 
information systems development costs are also included in student services and administrative expense 
in response to the growing size and complexity of its varied educational program offerings  the company continued its development and implementation of a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting costs associated with this project are being capitalized 
indirect expenses  such as training and employee communication  are being charged directly to expense as incurred 
at the end of fiscal  costs capitalized totaled million  of which million was capitalized during this year 
this compares to million of total capitalized costs at the end of fiscal  of which million was capitalized in that year 
many of the elements of this system have now been placed into service and the capitalized costs are being amortized to expense over the estimated useful life of each program element  but not exceeding five years 
amortization began in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  amortization expense totaled million compared to million in the previous year 
cumulatively  a total of million has been amortized to expense through the end of fiscal in addition to the amounts amortized to expense  million of related but indirect activity costs were charged directly to expense in fiscal this compares to million charged directly to expense in the previous year 
one of the company s directors is also an investor in  and a director of  a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with system development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm have been negotiated to a level believed to be comparable to those charged to similar customers 
fees paid to this consulting firm during fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
as the student information system moved from its development phase to deployment  fees paid by the company to this consulting firm in fiscal declined to approximately million 
devry university in the devry university segment  operating income and the operating margin declined from last year 
contributing to the fiscal year lower earnings were the lesser total undergraduate student enrollments discussed above and increased spending on undergraduate new student recruiting to increase future term enrollments 
income was also affected by the increased number of new teaching locations and expanding educational operations to support the increased enrollments in online programs 
although spending at the undergraduate campuses was curtailed as enrollments declined  significant fixed costs of operation  such as facility related costs  were not able to be reduced 
also affecting income was the recognition of a million pre tax asset impairment loss on the toronto area furniture and laboratory equipment used under the teach out agreement with rcc as discussed above 
this agreement has reduced the company s operating losses at the toronto campus below what such losses were under company management in fiscal and below what the losses would have been if the company continued to manage the educational process and services through the current year 
partly offsetting these factors in the undergraduate operations was the positive effect on margins from higher enrollments at keller graduate school and from the positive effect on income from the conversion to an eight week term length aligned with the common devry university calendar as discussed above 
additionally  price increases of approximately five to six percent for both undergraduate and graduate students were implemented in july and another price increase was implemented for the term that began in march professional and training in the professional and training segment  operating income declined by almost million from the previous year because of the effects on enrollment and revenues from the change in the cpa exam format and schedule as discussed above 
also  cost increases for development of the new cpa exam format materials adversely affected income for the year 
because of the change to the cpa exam schedule  the company believes that the historical becker operating year that ended in april with the administration of the spring cpa exam is no longer the most appropriate fiscal year end 
effective with the company s fiscal  the becker fiscal year will be aligned with the june year end of devry inc this change in accounting will be implemented and reported in the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effect of this change in accounting is expected to add approximately per share for the first quarter and total year of fiscal medical and healthcare income from the ross university acquisition was first incorporated into the company s financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal following completion of its may acquisition 
for fiscal year  ross university contributed million of operating income  or a margin  before interest expense and amortization expense of intangible assets associated with its acquisition 
interest expense increased by million from fiscal because of the fourth quarter of fiscal borrowings for the acquisition of ross university 
during fiscal  borrowings were reduced by million to million using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 
short term interest rates  that serve as the basis for the interest rate on this debt  remained low during fiscal but have now begun to increase 
the company intends to make further debt reductions during fiscal  which should offset the effect of higher interest rates 
taxes on income were of pretax income for the year compared to in the previous year 
in fiscal  the company recognized non recurring tax benefits of million associated with the restructuring of its canadian operations 
without this non recurring benefit  the tax rate for fiscal would have been 
the company s tax rate on income is the composite of state and federal taxes on operations other than from ross university and a single digit rate on the earnings of ross university  most of which is earned offshore in jurisdictions where the company has agreements with those governments that exempt ross earnings from local income taxes 
for the foreseeable future  the company intends to reinvest the ross university earnings and cash flow to reduce outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations at the schools  and pursue future business opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a current provision for the payment of us income taxes on these earnings 
application of critical accounting policies note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   describes in more detail the method of application of significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below 
revenue recognition devry university tuition and technology fees  ross university tuition revenues for the basic science semesters and deaconess college of nursing revenues are billed at the start of each academic term 
that revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over that academic term 
revenues from ross university clinical terms is recognized based upon the student s weekly schedule of actual attendance 
tuition and other refunds are reported as a reduction of revenues 
textbook and other educational supply sales and commissions on such sales by follett are recognized when the sale occurs 
expense recognition advertising costs are charged to expense in the period in which materials are purchased or services are rendered 
similarly  all start up expenses related to new operating locations and new curriculum development costs are also charged directly to expense as incurred 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined by analysis of both the current level of accounts receivable and current loss rates on collections of accounts receivable from students 
in addition  the determination of the allowance considers projections of future receivable levels and collection loss rates 
this analysis is performed periodically throughout the year and required provisions to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels are charged to expense in each period as required 
internally developed software selected costs associated with developing the company s new student information system and its new budgeting and forecasting system have been capitalized in accordance with the rules on accounting for costs of computer software developed for internal use 
land  buildings and equipment fixed asset acquisitions are recorded at cost 
depreciation  including depreciation on the capitalized software development costs  is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is accounted for using the intrinsic value approach of apb and all required disclosures relative to such compensation and its pro forma effect on earnings are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective with the first quarter of fiscal  stock based compensation will be recorded as compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  entitled goodwill and other intangible assets  the company annually undertakes an assessment of the fair value of its reporting units compared to their carrying value for potential impairment of goodwill  and of the fair value compared to carrying value of intangible assets arising from a business combination 
this assessment is performed either annually  or more frequently if circumstances require  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist 
the valuation is based upon several factors including estimates of future revenues and earnings  a discounted cash flow analysis for several future years  and includes other assumptions such as future income tax and interest discount rates 
such estimates require significant judgment  and over the period of future years  actual results may differ from these estimates 
although management believes that its estimates are appropriate  decreases in earnings and cash flow from the estimates used in these assessments and or significant changes in other assumptions underlying the analysis could result in impairment charges in future periods 
at june  intangible assets from business combinations totaled million  and goodwill totaled million 
together these assets equal approximately of total assets  and any impairment could significantly affect future results of operation 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying amount of its major long lived assets  principally real estate  whenever changes in circumstances or events occur that indicate that the value of such assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in conjunction with an offer to purchase one of its owned educational facilities  the company determined that this facility was no longer essential to its denver area operations 
although the original offer to purchase the property was terminated by the prospective purchasers  the company has now offered this property for sale to other interested buyers 
accordingly  the company  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist  determined the fair value of this property in relation to its expected market value 
environmental liabilities the company s educational operations do not produce or cause environmental problems and the company is not currently subject to any environmental claims 
accordingly  the company has made no estimate of future liabilities 
income tax liabilities the company recognizes income tax expense based upon income earned 
however  some expenses may be recorded in one period for financial statement reporting but in another period s tax return  eg depreciation expense 
these timing differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the company s balance sheet to reflect the subsequent payment of these amounts 
these deferred tax items are regularly analyzed and valuation reserves established as required for deferred tax assets when their realization is in doubt 
estimates and assumptions the company s financial statements include estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses whose exact amounts will not be known until future periods 
the company s management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the critical accounting policies discussed above and the significant estimates included in the financial statements in this report 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  actual amounts may differ from the estimates included in the financial statements and could produce materially different results in the future 
significant estimates and assumptions included in the company s financial statements include the method of revenue recognition across the academic periods  determining the useful lives of equipment and facilities whose value is a significant portion of the company s total assets  determining the value and useful lives of acquired finite lived intangible assets  determining the value of indefinite lived intangible assets  determining the pattern of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets over their economic life  estimating losses to be realized in the future on the collection of presently owed student receivable balances  estimating costs associated with any settlement of law suits in which the company is a defendant and estimating health care reimbursement claims for medical services rendered but for which claims have not yet been processed or paid 
in fiscal  the company revised the estimate of its liability for future teaching obligations at becker professional review relating to its free continuing help policy 
after review  the company concluded that there was no expected future cost associated with this obligation 
the methodology by which each of the above estimates has been determined for fiscal is consistent with the manner in which such estimates were made in prior years although the parameters used in setting the value of these estimates is regularly analyzed and may change as current conditions warrant 
variances from estimate to actual expense for these items in past years have not been material 
although different assumptions about the parameters affecting each of these estimates could produce a different amount of estimate  the reasonably determined range of estimates for each item would generally not be large enough to materially change the overall company reported financial results 
contingencies the company is subject to occasional lawsuits  administrative proceedings  regulatory reviews associated with financial assistance programs and other claims arising in the normal conduct of its business 
the following is a description of pending litigation that may be considered other than ordinary and routine litigation incidental to the business 
in january  royal gardner  a graduate of one of devry university s los angeles area campuses  filed a class action complaint against devry inc and devry university  inc in the superior court of the state of california  county of los angeles  on behalf of all students enrolled in the post baccalaureate degree program in information technology 
the suit alleges that the program offered by devry did not conform to the program as it was presented in the advertising and other marketing materials 
in march  the complaint was dismissed by the court with limited right to amend and re file 
the complaint was subsequently amended and re filed 
during the first quarter of the company s fiscal year  a new complaint was filed in the same court by gavino teanio with the same general allegations and by the same plaintiffs attorneys 
this subsequent action has been stayed pending the outcome of the gardner matter 
discovery continues in the gardner matter  but there is no determinable date at which this matter may be brought to conclusion 
in november  afshin zarinebaf  ali mousavi and another graduate of one of devry university s chicago area campuses filed a class action complaint in the circuit court for cook county  illinois that alleges devry graduates do not have appropriate skills for employment in the computer information systems field 
the complaint was subsequently dismissed by the court  but was amended and re filed to include as a plaintiff mark macenas  a then current student in another curriculum from a second chicago area campus 
discovery continues  and a hearing to determine class action certification has been held  though the court has not yet announced its ruling 
the two alleged class actions seek money damages of an indeterminate amount 
the company has accrued million representing the estimated minimum amount to resolve the above two class action claims 
in conjunction with the required annual review procedures related to its administration of financial aid programs under the ontario student aid program  the toronto area devry campuses engaged in discussions with the ontario ministry of education relating to certain additional information requirements for the and financial aid years 
these additional information requirements could then serve as the basis for a ministry claim for the return of some amounts of financial aid disbursed to students attending these campuses 
the company s toronto area campus discontinued operation and its students completed their education under an agreement with rcc college of technology as previously announced 
accordingly  the company is no longer participating in these financial aid programs 
final discussions with the ministry have resulted in a resolution of these claims during the fourth quarter of fiscal year for an amount less than cdn  for which the company had previously accrued 
in august counterclaims were filed against the company s subsidiary dominica management  inc and the ross university school of medicine by defendants american university of antigua college of medicine  neal simon and sol weltman in a case filed by dominica management  inc in the us district court for the southern district of new york in september the original case filed by dominica management  inc sought relief primarily for alleged copyright infringement  misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information  and unfair competition 
the counterclaims allege  inter alia  anticompetitive behavior  tortious interference with prospective economic relationships  and defamation 
damages sought in connection with the counterclaims are in excess of  discovery into these claims is commencing 
while the ultimate outcome of these contingencies is difficult to estimate at this time  the company does intend to vigorously defend itself with respect to the pending claims 
at this time  the company does not believe that the outcome of current claims  administrative proceedings  regulatory reviews and lawsuits will have a material effect on its cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition  books  educational supplies and fees 
these payments include funds originating as student and family educational loans  other financial aid from various federal  state and provincial loan and grant programs  and student and family financial resources 
the pattern of cash receipts during the year is somewhat cyclical 
the level of accounts receivable from which payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  books and fees each semester 
at devry university  the principal undergraduate semesters begin in july  november and march although shorter eight week session courses are also offered beginning in the months of september  january and may 
these shorter sessions have the effect of somewhat smoothing the cash flow peaks throughout the year as they represent a new revenue billing and collection cycle within the longer semester cycle 
collections of student receivables generally reach their peak during the first half of each academic period  reaching seventy to eighty percent of collections for that entire period 
collections during this first part of each period exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period and generally provide sufficient cash flow for the balance of the semester s operation when collections are lower 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point during the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the undergraduate spring semester  the end of a graduate school term and the end of a student financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
ross university in the medical and healthcare segment experiences a similar operating pattern but its semesters begin in may  september and january  thus smoothing the cyclical pattern of the company s cash flows from devry university 
the becker cpa review operation within the professional and training segment operation has historically had two major term starts per year  but the change to an on demand cpa exam format beginning in april has created a new and much smoother enrollment and cash flow pattern throughout the year than previously experienced 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of related reserves  were approximately million  compared to million last year 
contributing to the increased receivables was approximately million of receivables at deaconess college of nursing which was not a part of the company last year 
the higher revenues  change in business cycle and fiscal year end period at becker cpa review resulted in an approximately million increase in receivables compared to the period reported last year 
higher revenues at keller graduate school and an increase in the average receivable per student at the undergraduate operations within devry university resulted in an approximately million increase in receivables 
the increase in accounts receivable at devry university was caused by higher tuition rates with no commensurate increase in the amount of available student financial aid  extended payment plans to better serve the growing number of military and adult students at devry and an increased proportion of part time students whose financial aid eligibility is less than for full time students 
also  the shorter eight week session length at devry university centers and online has produced a slower collection of receivables as administrative systems and staff adjust to the new and shorter collection cycle 
reserves for uncollectible accounts for both undergraduate and graduate student receivables were increased throughout the year to reflect the company s current collection experience on balances owed 
the company has undertaken a number of initiatives to help improve the collection of its student receivables 
these initiatives include the addition of a new payment processing system that allows students to initiate payments to devry electronically 
electronic payments from students may be charged to their credit card  checking or savings account 
these electronic payments are received by devry more quickly than if sent by mail or delivered by the student to their teaching location 
devry university has also added a self service web site that allows students to view their personal  up to date financial aid information 
by allowing students to view the status of their financial aid awards  students can respond more quickly to additional document requests needed for further processing and can receive messages with student specific information 
to further help reduce the level of company provided interim student financing under the devry university undergraduate educardr program  many students participate in supplementary loan programs funded by private lenders 
the supplementary loans are aimed at students whose eligibility for federal and state funded financial aid is not sufficient to cover all their costs of education 
some of these loans are subject to a limited company default risk sharing agreement 
at june   the company had fully reserved for and recognized as expense the entire amount of its share of the default risk 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds at devry university  ross university and deaconess college of nursing 
the company estimates that historically  more than of its devry university undergraduate students tuition  book and fee revenues were financed by government provided financial aid to students 
keller graduate school collections from student participation in federal loan programs has increased during the past several years and is now approximately equal to of revenues 
ross university collections from student participation in federal loan programs are approximately of its revenues  both at the medical and veterinary school 
the financial aid and assistance programs in which the company s students participate are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained in the future 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government funded financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
such program reviews may be conducted at any educational institution at any time and have been conducted in the past at the company s educational facilities and headquarters locations 
previous department of education and state regulatory agency program reviews have not resulted in material findings or adjustments 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from various state governments and the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
these funds are received either subsequent to the completion of the financial aid authorization and disbursement process for the benefit of the student or just prior to that authorization 
once the authorization and disbursement process to the student has been completed  the funds are then available for transfer to unrestricted accounts at which time these funds become available for use by the company in current operations 
this process generally occurs within the period of the academic term for which such funds were authorized  with no academic term being more than weeks in length 
at june   cash in the amount of million was held in restricted bank accounts 
at june   cash in restricted bank accounts equaled million 
in june  the company received notice from the department of education that the equity  primary reserve and net income ratios financial responsibility ratio yielded a composite score of for the year ended june  a minimum composite score of is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the department s financial responsibility standards 
effective with receipt of this notice  the department required devry university to make financial aid disbursements under a cash monitoring mode 
under this cash monitoring  devry university could not submit requests for financial aid funds for its students in an amount greater than the amount of the actual disbursements made to students included in the request 
devry university has historically requested financial aid reimbursements in a fashion similar to that imposed by this restriction and  therefore  cash flow was not significantly affected 
in late july  devry university received notice from the department of education that the restriction to operate under cash monitoring was suspended pending submission of audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending june  audited financial statements were subsequently submitted as required 
the company s calculation of its composite score at june was confirmed by the department of education to be above the required minimum of the company has calculated its composite score at june   and determined that it is above the required minimum of cash generated from operations in fiscal was million  compared to million last year 
contributing to the decrease in cash flow from operations was lower net income  down million from last year  and an increase in accounts receivable  up million  both as described above 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million compared to million in the previous year 
in just the past three years  the company has invested over million for expansion  facility improvement and the replacement and improvement of school laboratories  teaching and administrative equipment for its educational program offerings 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately the same as it was in fiscal and the two previous years 
although there are no new large devry university campus sites planned or under construction  there are further facility expansion plans at both the ross university medical and veterinary schools 
other new or expanded operating locations are expected to be in leased facilities  thus requiring less capital spending by the company 
capital spending on improvements  including instructional technology  and expansion is an integral component of the company s operating strategy 
in may  in conjunction with its acquisition of ross university  the company terminated its million revolving loan agreement with a group of banks and entered into two new loan agreements  a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks and senior notes held by a group of insurance company lenders 
these new loan agreements provided funding for the ross acquisition and for working capital needs as might be required by the company 
under these new agreements  all borrowings and letters of credit issued under these agreements are through devry inc and global education international gei  an international subsidiary 
in june  the company amended the revolving credit agreement with its group of banks to extend loan maturity to july   reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by approximately depending upon the achievement of certain financial performance ratios  and increase  at the company s option  the borrowing limit by  the current loan agreements and their borrowing limits are as follows revolving credit agreement devry inc as borrower  can be increased by  at the company s option gei as borrower  total  senior notes devry inc as borrower  gei as borrower  total  all borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility now mature on july  at june   aggregate borrowings under these agreements totaled million  consisting of borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement and borrowings of million under the senior notes 
based upon these levels of borrowing at fiscal year end  a increase in short term interest rates would result in million of additional annual interest expense 
at fiscal year end  letters of credit issued under the revolving credit agreement totaled approximately million 
approximately million of these letters of credit were issued in conjunction with devry university  deaconess college of nursing and ross university s participation in student financial aid programs 
most of the letters of credit have expiration dates of one year or less 
to date  no amount has ever been drawn under any letter of credit issued on behalf of the company 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  there are no required repayments until the maturity date 
there are also no required repayments under the terms of the senior note agreements until their maturity in prepayments during the first two years of the senior note agreements included a prepayment penalty 
at june  the two year prepayment penalty period had expired 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest  at the company s discretion  at either the prime rate or a eurodollar libor rate plus to  depending upon the achievement of certain financial ratios 
at june   the additional interest rate was  the same rate as at june borrowings under the senior note agreement bear interest at a eurodollar libor rate plus 
both agreements include financial and other covenants such as achieving a required fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio of  and achieving a minimum department of education financial responsibility ratio of covenants in the agreement are generally similar to those typically found in other loan agreements and are not expected to hinder the company s plans for future operation 
as discussed above  in june the company received notification from the department of education that the company s financial responsibility ratio yielded a composite score of for the year ended june  this notification created an event of default as defined by the revolving credit agreement covenants that require a minimum composite score of the composite score as calculated by the department of education was affected by the inclusion of intangible assets from the ross university acquisition 
in june  the lenders waived this default effective june the company s calculation of its composite score at june was confirmed by the department of education to be above the required minimum of the company has calculated its composite score at june   and determined that it is above the required minimum of in the first quarter of fiscal  the company entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect approximately  of its current borrowings from sharp increases in short term interest rates upon which its borrowings are based 
these interest rate cap agreements expire during the first quarter of the company s new fiscal year  the company intends to periodically evaluate the need for future interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates and its borrowing levels 
the company s only long term contractual obligations consist of its revolving line of credit and senior notes  operating leases on facilities and equipment  and agreements for various services 
at june   there were no required payments under the company s borrowing agreements prior to their maturity 
required payments under non cancelable operating leases with a term in excess of one year are million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company is not a party to any off balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements  nor are there any unconsolidated subsidiaries of the company 
there are no loans extended to any officer  director or other person affiliated with the company 
the company has not entered into any synthetic leases  and there are no residual purchase or value commitments related to any facility lease 
the company has not entered into any derivative  swap  futures contract  put  call  hedge or non exchange traded contract except for the interest rate cap agreements noted above 
under the terms of these interest rate cap agreements  the company was not obligated to any further payment liability beyond their original purchase price 
as of the end of the fiscal year  the company had posted more than million of surety bonds to various governmental jurisdictions on behalf of devry university and becker professional review in the united states  and approximately cdn million in canada 
the surety bonds are related primarily to its student recruiting and educational operations in those jurisdictions 
if the company were to fail to meet its obligations in these jurisdictions  it could be responsible for payment up to the amount of the bond issued to that jurisdiction 
to date  no surety bond has ever been paid in connection with the company failing to meet its obligations 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations at june   is presented below dollars in thousands less than after due in total year years years years long term debt    operating leases      employment agreement     other long term obligations total cash obligations      included in the company s consolidated cash balances of million at june   is million of cash attributable to the ross university offshore operations 
for the foreseeable future  it is the company s intention to reinvest this cash and subsequent earnings and cash flow to service gei s outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations of the ross schools and pursue future business opportunities outside the united states 
in accordance with this plan  cash held by ross university will not be available for general company purposes such as at devry university 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund both its current operations and its current growth plans for the foreseeable future  unless future investment opportunities  similar to the acquisition of ross university  should arise 
effect of new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas r entitled share based payment including stock options 
this revised accounting standard requires the recognition of compensation expense arising from share based payments  such as stock options 
the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value approach of apb and  in accordance with apb  has not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options to date 
as required  however  disclosures relative to such compensation and its pro forma effect on earnings are included in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the new accounting standard is effective for the company beginning with its first quarter of fiscal the company estimates that the additional compensation cost to be recognized in its fiscal will be approximately per share 
this estimate is based upon a forecast of the number of shares subject to stock option grants during fiscal and the fair value of these grants 
the company estimates that there will be a cumulative effect from the change in accounting required by this new standard that reduces retained earnings by approximately million but increases additional paid in capital by approximately million as of june  had the new accounting standard been in effect during fiscal  net income in that year would have been reduced by approximately million  or six percent from that originally reported  and earnings per share would have been compared to the originally reported 
for fiscal  net income would have been reduced by approximately million  or from that originally reported and earnings per share would have been compared to the originally reported 
the company expects to adopt this new accounting standard using the retrospective method and restating previous years financial statements accordingly 
the company is still evaluating the effects of the proposed new standard on its previously reported statements of income and financial position but believes that the amounts noted above fairly present the approximate effects of this accounting standard 
in may  the fasb released sfas entitled accounting changes and error corrections 
this new accounting standard details the manner in which changes in accounting principle are to be recognized and disclosed 
this new standard requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle 
this standard becomes effective for the company s fiscal year the company is not currently contemplating any changes in accounting principle and  accordingly  can not determine how this new standard might effect its future period financial statements 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the nature of the company s operations does not subject it to a concentration or dependency upon the price levels or fluctuations in pricing of any one particular or group of commodities 
the financial position and results of operations of ross university s caribbean operations are measured using the us dollar as the functional currency 
substantially all ross university financial transactions are denominated in the us dollar 
the financial position and results of operations of the company s canadian educational programs are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
the canadian operations have not entered into any material long term contracts to purchase or sell goods and services  other than the lease agreement on its principal teaching facility 
the company does not have any foreign exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments related to protection from changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
because the assets and liabilities of the company s canadian operations are small relative to those of the company  canadian assets are currently less than of total company assets  changes in currency value within the range of changes recently experienced  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
based upon the current value of the net assets in the canadian operations  a change of in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar would result in a pre tax translation adjustment of less than the company s customers are principally individual students enrolled in its various educational programs 
accordingly  concentration of accounts receivable credit risk is small relative to total revenues or accounts receivable 
the company s cash is held in accounts at various financial institutions 
the company selects the financial institutions with which it maintains deposits from amongst only those that are the largest and most financially secure 
therefore  although the amount on deposit at a given institution will typically exceed amounts subject to guarantee  the company has not experienced any deposit losses to date nor does it expect to incur such losses in the future 
the interest rate on the company s debt is based upon libor interest rates for periods typically ranging from one to three months 
based upon the level of company borrowings at fiscal year end  a increase in short term interest rates would result in million of additional annual interest expense 
during july and august  the company repaid million of its borrowings  reducing the annual effect of a change in interest rates to million 
however  future investment opportunities and cash flow generated from operations may affect the level of outstanding borrowings and the effect of a change in interest rates 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect a portion of its borrowings from sharp increases in short term interest rates 
these agreements  however  expire by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year and will no longer afford any protection from changes in interest rates 
the company intends to periodically review further debt repayment and the need for additional interest rate protection agreements in light of projected changes in working capital  investment requirements and expectations about future period interest rates
