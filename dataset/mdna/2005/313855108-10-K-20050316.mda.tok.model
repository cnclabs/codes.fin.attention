the company also guaranteed the debt of an independent dealer that sells the company s vehicles 
the company believes its risk of loss is low  no losses have been incurred to date 
the inability of the company to enter into these types of arrangements in the future due to unforeseen circumstances is not expected to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the present portfolio  collateral value and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by 
million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from six months to five years based on the terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material 
table of contents warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty cost as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in the increase in the rate in is primarily due to the acquisitions of the refuse truck body businesses in late which experience higher warranty claims due to their usage pattern  and to the introduction of new custom fire rescue vehicles that incurred higher warranty costs when used for the first time 
management believes the reserve recorded at december  is appropriate 
a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
worker s compensation and product liability reserves the company is partially self insured for worker s compensation claims with various stop loss thresholds 
when a worker s compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated  if any is expected  to settle the claim 
the establishment of a liability for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  management s estimate of the nature and severity of total claims and an independent actuarial valuation 
the company utilizes a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
while management believes the current reserve is adequate  a increase or decrease in the average cost per claim in would have decreased or increased operating income by 
million  respectively 
due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self insured for its product liability exposures  it records a reserve when a potential loss associated with an asserted claim is probable and reasonably estimable 
the liability is based on an assessment of each claim by the company s third party administrator  management s current knowledge of the matter and consultation with counsel 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established any reserve for potential losses resulting from hearing loss litigation see note n  if the company is not successful in its defense  it will record a charge for such claims at the time a judgment or settlement is made 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  sfas no 
also requires the company to test these assets annually for impairment  the company performs this test at the beginning of the fourth quarter unless impairment indicators arise earlier 
the company continues to amortize definite lived intangible assets over their useful life 
a review for impairment requires judgment in estimated cash flows based upon estimates of future sales  operating income  working capital improvements and capital expenditures 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units 
if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required against the unit s goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
s transition rules  the company performed an assessment as of january   the date of the statement s adoption 
this evaluation resulted in an million impairment charge in related to a niche tool group business 
the annual testing conducted in and did not result in any impairment 
although management believes that the assumptions and estimates used were reasonable  a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit is performed along with the impairment test 
the analysis indicated that a change in the operating margin assumption could result in a goodwill impairment in the environmental products group of approximately million 
a significant portion of the goodwill in this group arose with the 
table of contents acquisitions of the refuse truck body businesses in  which have had poor operating results since acquisition 
financial market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency options and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by maintaining a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within established percentages of between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix 
of the company s debt at december   was used to support financial services assets  the weighted average remaining life of those assets is typically under three years and the debt is match funded to the financing assets
