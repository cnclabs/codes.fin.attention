item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and operating philosophy regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit  which began operations in our primary operating and investment goal is long term growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return  which we hope to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning  operating and developing neighborhood and community shopping centers that are anchored by market leading supermarkets  and located in areas with attractive demographics 
we own and operate our shopping centers through our operating partnership  regency centers  lp rclp  in which we currently own approximately of the operating partnership units 
regency s operating  investing and financing activities are generally performed by rclp  its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures with third parties 
currently  our real estate investment portfolio before depreciation totals billion with shopping centers in states  including approximately billion in real estate assets composed of shopping centers owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in states 

portfolio information is presented a on a combined basis  including unconsolidated joint ventures combined basis  b on a basis that excludes the unconsolidated joint ventures consolidated properties and c on a basis that includes only the unconsolidated joint ventures unconsolidated properties 
we believe that providing our shopping center portfolio information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we own  including those that we partially own and for which we provide property and asset management services 
at december   our gross leasable area gla on a combined basis totaled million square feet and was leased 
the gla for the consolidated properties totaled million square feet and was leased 
the gla for the unconsolidated properties totaled million square feet and was leased 
we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space to grocers and retail side shop tenants in our shopping centers 
we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers  and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
a neighborhood center is a convenient  cost effective distribution platform for food retailers 
grocery anchored centers generate substantial daily traffic and offer sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants 
this high traffic generates increased sales  thereby driving higher occupancy  rental rates and rental rate growth for regency  which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 
we seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty tenants  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers 
we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative pci to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our non grocer specialty retailers 
the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s grocery anchor  help to stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through new shopping center development  where we acquire the land and construct the building 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our market leading grocers and anchors  and our specialty retail customers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term leases from the grocery anchors and produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process can require up to months from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up and stabilization of rental income  depending upon the size of the project 
generally  anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center  resulting in rental income during the development phase 
we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs without compromising our investment grade ratings 
our approach is founded on our self funding business model 
this model utilizes center recycling as a key component 
our recycling strategy calls for us to

index to financial statements re deploy the proceeds from the sales of properties into new  higher quality developments that we expect to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 
our commitment to maintaining a high quality shopping center portfolio dictates that we continually assess the value of all of our properties and sell those that no longer meet our long term investment criteria 
joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new development  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment  and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures 
joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency 
although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest  we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our long term investment strategy 
regency is not subject to liability and has no obligations or guarantees of the joint ventures beyond its ownership percentage 
we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry  and we are addressing them accordingly 
an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers  which would reduce our rental revenues  however  we believe that our investment focus on grocery anchored shopping centers that provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy 
increased competition from super centers such as wal mart could result in grocery anchor closings or consolidations in the grocery store industry 
we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants sales in our shopping centers that operate near super centers 
a slowdown in our shopping center development program could reduce operating revenues and gains from sales 
we believe that developing shopping centers in markets with strong demographics with leading grocery stores will enable us to continue to maintain our development program at historical averages

although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close the related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
on february   winn dixie stores  inc filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we currently lease seven stores to winn dixie  three of which are owned directly by us and four are owned in joint ventures 
our annualized base rent from winn dixie including our share of the joint ventures is million or less than of our annual base rents 
as of the date of their bankruptcy filing  winn dixie owed regency  in past due rent related to real estate tax reimbursements 
winn dixie has not yet given notice to us as to whether they will reject any of the lease agreements between us 
we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any of our other tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of our annual base rental revenues

the following describes our equity capital transactions during preferred units we have issued preferred units in various amounts since  the net proceeds of which we used to reduce the balance of the line

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results  and discussion and analysis of these results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity and industry standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
revenue recognition and tenant receivables tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements  and include base rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
we analyze tenant receivables  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy  and we estimate the recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the collectability of tenant receivables 
capitalization of costs we have an investment services group with an established infrastructure that supports the due diligence  land acquisition  construction  leasing and accounting of our development properties 
all direct costs related to these activities are capitalized 
included in these costs are interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction  as well as estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and deemed directly or indirectly related to our development activity 
if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized  or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement 
based on these estimates  we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities 
we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores 
if we determine that permanent impairment exists due to our inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 

table of contents 
index to financial statements discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets statement  the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated 
given the nature of all real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
due to these uncertainties  it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement prior to the sale formally closing 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth in statement the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale  in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued 
consistent with statement  any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures is not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party  but retains a property or asset management function  is also not considered discontinued 
therefore  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties that the company  in its judgment  has no continuing involvement are classified as discontinued 
income tax status the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit  defined under the internal revenue code 
we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status 
determining our taxable income  calculating distributions  and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code 
because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations  our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities

revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of statement statement r supersedes opinion generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  statement r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company adopted statement r using the modified prospective method on january  as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on its results of operations in as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
we have a long term omnibus plan the plan under which our board of directors may grant stock options and other stock based awards to officers  directors and other key employees 
all stock options previously granted contained stock option reload rights 
the reload rights allowed for an option holder to receive new options each time existing options were exercised if the existing options were exercised under specific criteria provided for in the plan 
in january  we offered to acquire the reload rights of existing stock options from our employees by issuing them additional stock options that will vest per year over four years 
as a result of the offer  on january   we granted  options with an exercise price of  the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
as a result  substantially all of the reload rights on existing stock options have been cancelled 
the options granted in january will be expensed to net income over a four year period beginning in in accordance with statement r 
results from operations comparison of the years ended december  to at december   on a combined basis  we were operating or developing shopping centers  as compared to shopping centers at the end of we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or stabilized properties 
development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial lease up process and have not reached their initial full occupancy reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least leased and rent paying on newly constructed or renovated gla

in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants for the gla that they lease from us  we also collect contingent rent based upon tenant sales  which we refer to as percentage rent 
tenants are also responsible for reimbursing us for their pro rata share of the expenses associated with operating our shopping centers

 accounting for sales of real estate 
profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless i a sale has been consummated  ii the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  iii we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and iv we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property

these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income  or they were properties sold to joint ventures where we have continuing involvement through our minority investment 
we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset 
we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies 
in the event a property is impaired  we write down the asset to fair value for held and used assets and to fair value less costs to sell for held for sale assets 
during and we established provisions for loss of  and million respectively  to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values 
provisions for loss on properties subsequently sold are reclassified to discontinued operations  therefore the million recorded in has been reclassified 
income from discontinued operations was million in related to properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of million and one property classified as held for sale 
income from discontinued operations was million in related to the operations of shopping centers in as well as in compliance with the adoption of statement  if we sell an asset in the current year  we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods 
this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations 
our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and we are primarily concerned with dry cleaning plants that currently operate or have operated at our shopping centers in the past 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate plants do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to environmentally approved systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on regency s financial position  liquidity  or operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line and the refinancing of long term debt  which currently contain fixed interest rates 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we have no plans to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate for all fixed rate debt variable rate libor debt average interest rate for all variable rate debt as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented above has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates
