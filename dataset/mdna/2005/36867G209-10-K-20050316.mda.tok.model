item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview genaera corporation is a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines for serious diseases from genomics and natural products 
research and development efforts are focused on anti angiogenesis and respiratory diseases 
we have four products in development addressing substantial unmet medical needs in major pharmaceutical markets 
since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales 
we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities  research and development collaboration payments and related equity investments 
we have incurred a loss in each year since our inception and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the previous three years in the period ended december  the financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting policies important to our financial condition and results of operations presented in our financial statements that require management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through development collaboration is recognized on a straight line basis over the development period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as liabilities until earned 
payments received that are refundable also are classified as liabilities until the refund provision expires 
we make an estimate as to the appropriate deferral period for recognition of revenue on any collaborative fees received 
changes in these estimates  due to the evolution of the development program  can have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recorded 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees and facility costs 
research and development expenses consist of independent research and development contract costs  contract manufacturing costs and costs associated with collaborative research and development arrangements 
in addition  we fund research and development at other research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable 
research and development expenses also include external activities  such as investigator sponsored trials 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient 
table of contents enrollment or the passage of time 
at the initiation of certain contracts  we must make an estimate as to the duration and expected completion date of the contract  which may require a change due to accelerations  delays or other adjustments to the contract period or work performed 
changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on the amount of research and development costs in a specific period 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic value based method set forth by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
effective january   we adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees must be accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at the fair value of either the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
estimating the fair value of equity securities involves a number of judgments and variables that are subject to significant change 
a change in the fair value estimate could have a significant effect on the amount of compensation cost 
on december   the financial accounting standards board published sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost related to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
share based payment transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
the provisions of sfas r are effective as of the first interim period that begins after june  accordingly  the company will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of fiscal year the implications of this revised standard will materially impact the company s results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal year and thereafter 
results of operations vs 
revenues we have received no revenues to date from product sales 
revenues recorded to date have consisted principally of revenues recognized under collaborations with third parties 
in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with medimmune  inc  to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
medimmune provided funding of million  payable in eight equal quarterly installments through april the r d funding  plus it funds external cost reimbursements for our research and development activities 
we could also receive up to million based on successful completion of future milestones 
in august  we received the first of such milestone payments as a result of the initiation of phase i clinical trials 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue related to external cost reimbursements million and milestone payments million 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue related to the r d funding million and external cost reimbursements million 
in february  the company received a phase ii small business innovative research program grant from the nih in the amount of million to support its aminosterol research program 
the grant extended over a two year period  which ended in february in february  the company notified the nih of a no cost extension of the original budget period by twelve months 
as a result of the notification  the grant was extended through february the company recognized no revenue related to this grant for the year ended december  the company recognized million as revenue related to this grant in year ended december  
table of contents research and development expenses our current research and development programs include squalamine  which consists of evizon for the treatment of amd and squalamine for the treatment of cancer  lomucin  il and other programs  which consist of trodusquemine for the treatment of obesity  other aminosterols for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and locilex cream for the treatment of infectious disease 
the following table illustrates our research and development projects and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status squalamine evizon phase ii active squalamine phase ii active lomucin phase ii active il program phase i active other programs trodusquemine research preclinical active inactive other aminosterols research active locilex cream phase iii inactive in april  we entered into a collaborative agreement with medimmune to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
research and development expenses for each of our projects consist of both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies for each project 
we also may incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  clinical development and manufacturing costs and consulting costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 
we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses in thousands incurred during the years ended december  and for our significant groups of research and development projects 
years ended december  squalamine program expenses lomucin program expenses il program expenses other program expenses indirect expenses research and development expenses have increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due primarily to increases in third party contract research million  manufacturing million and clinical trial costs million and an increase in costs for research and development supplies million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of age related macular degeneration  as well as resulting increases in personnel costs million 
in addition  indirect expenses increased million as a result of increased overhead  such as utilities  insurance and general facilities costs related to additional personnel and increased research  clinical and manufacturing efforts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in our lomucin tm million and il program million expenses due to the conclusion of our phase ii clinical trial of lomucin in patients with cystic fibrosis in and the transfer of responsibility for development and commercialization efforts on the il program to medimmune in 
table of contents april of  as well as a decrease in consulting costs million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of age related macular degeneration 
the costs incurred to date on each of our development projects are not reasonably estimable because work on one program often supports or enhances another program 
for example  it is not possible to separate the time and resources spent in development of squalamine lactate as a product candidate to treat wet amd and as a product candidate to treat cancer because i early research and development efforts devoted to cancer research led to development of genaera s product candidate squalamine lactate trade name evizon tm for amd  ii clinical trial work pursuant to genaera s investigational new drug ind application for cancer forms part of the safety data base for the ind it filed with the fda for wet amd  iii genaera s manufacturing development for squalamine lactate supports both the amd and cancer programs  and iv nonclinical testing conducted to support genaera s ind for squalamine lactate in one indication may be used to support its ind in the other indication 
the level of research and development expenses in future periods will depend principally upon the progress of our research and development programs and our capital resources 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
preclinical and clinical studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent a program s advancement through the various stages of product development and significantly impact the costs to be incurred and the time involved in bringing a program to completion 
such delays  limitations or prevention of a program s advancement could harm our financial condition and operating results and inhibit our ability to raise additional funds to support ongoing operations 
the nature of costs incurred in the future will also vary depending upon the stage of the product candidate s development 
product candidates in the research stage often require significant laboratory work to develop and prepare the product candidate for preclinical testing and for testing in humans 
costs for such work typically include genaera staff  genaera facilities  lab supplies and equipment and fees to contract research facilities supervised by genaera personnel 
all products to be tested in humans require preclinical testing and often require additional nonclinical testing while clinical trials are in process to fulfill regulatory requirements 
preclinical and nonclinical work requires expenditures for staffing and facilities at genaera 
costs will also be incurred for work done by contract research facilities under genaera supervision 
early stage products require development of manufacturing methods  supporting analytical and research work and qualifying vendors  including contract manufacturers 
products in human testing  particularly later stage trials  require manufacturing more significant quantities of product 
the costs of conducting clinical trials include fees to contract research organizations to conduct the trials  payments to physicians and research centers  and payments for a wide range of services to prepare for clinical trials  support the trials and manage data gathered in the trials 
internal genaera costs for clinical trials include staffing and infrastructure to design  adapt and manage the trials as well as managing vendors providing supporting services 
smaller but continuing costs throughout the clinical trials process also include quality control and regulatory compliance activities conducted by genaera staff and through contractors supervised by genaera 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
general and administrative costs increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due principally to increases in personnel as a result of our expanded development efforts million  increased professional fees million  partially due to maintaining compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and increases in investor relations expenses million 

table of contents interest income and expense we recognized interest income of million and thousand in and  respectively 
we recognized interest expense of  and  in and  respectively 
interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from cash and investments 
interest expense is primarily comprised of expense related to our indebtedness to merrill lynch bank usa merrill lynch 
interest income increased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to higher average investment balances 
interest expense decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to the repayment of our indebtedness to merrill lynch 
see note note payable for additional information 
we recognized a loss on the write off of fixed assets of million for the year ended december  and a gain on the sale of fixed assets of million in the year ended december  as a result of the sale of excess research equipment

the grant extended over a two year period  which ended in february and was subsequently extended through february the company recognized million as revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  research and development expenses we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses in thousands incurred during the years ended december  and for our significant groups of research and development projects 
years ended december  squalamine program expenses lomucin program expenses il program expenses other program expenses indirect expenses research and development expenses decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period the year before  due primarily to the absence of a one time accrual of severance and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in august and november of million  as well as a reduction of overall indirect costs million such as recruiting  supplies and facilities costs as a result of our cost containment efforts and reduced headcount 
in addition  costs associated with our lomucin program  squalamine program  il program and other programs decreased as a result of the conclusion of our phase ii clinical study of lomucin in patients with cystic fibrosis in million  a decrease in manufacturing efforts in squalamine program for cancer million  the transfer of responsibility for development and commercialization efforts on the il program to medimmune in april of million and the decrease in 
table of contents research and development efforts in trodulamine million 
these reductions were partially offset by increased research and clinical development efforts and consulting expenses million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of age related macular degeneration 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
general and administrative costs decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period the year before  due principally to reduced payroll and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in million  the absence of a one time accrual of severance and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in august and november of million  as well as continuing cost containment initiatives 
these reductions were partially offset by small increases in several categories of general corporate expenses 
interest income and expense we recognized interest income of thousand and million in and  respectively 
we recognized interest expense of thousand and million in and  respectively 
interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from cash and investments 
interest expense is primarily comprised of expense related to our indebtedness to merrill lynch 
interest income decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to declining investment interest yields and lower average investment balances 
interest expense decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to the repayment of our indebtedness to merrill lynch 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary use of cash was to finance our research and development operations 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of our securities totaling approximately million since our initial public offering in december and including the proceeds from the following private placements of our securities  net of costs  in  and million april  million may  million november  million january  and million november in addition to the above  we have funded our operations from contract and grant revenues  research and development expense reimbursements  interest income  lease financing and debt financing 
our goal is to conduct significant research  pre clinical development  clinical testing and manufacturing activities over the next several years 
we expect that these activities  together with projected general and administrative expenses  will result in continued and significant losses 
current liabilities increased by million from million at december  to million at december   due primarily to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the 
table of contents timing and magnitude of our current development contracts 
prior to  we had an agreement with abbott laboratories abbott providing for the purchase of approximately million of bulk drug substance for locilex cream 
as fda approval of locilex cream did not occur  we renegotiated this agreement with abbott in  paying abbott million and receiving partial delivery of material 
an additional million was due to abbott and payable if we receive in excess of million of additional funds in any year beginning in  in which case of such excess over million shall be payable to abbott 
we have no further purchase commitments to abbott and abbott has no further supply requirements to us 
as a result of the company s financing activities during and and other cash inflows  million and million of this liability was payable and paid to abbott on march  and  respectively 
no portion of the liability was payable to abbott on march  as the company did not receive in excess of million of cash inflows during as a result of the company s financing activities during and other cash inflows  million of the remaining liability was payable and paid to abbott on march  as a result of the company s financing activities during  the remaining liability of million is due and payable to abbott on march  and is included in short term liabilities as of december our capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  the demand for products based on our technology  if and when such products are approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement and a preferred stock purchase agreement with medimmune pursuant to which we received million 
medimmune has funded million plus external cost reimbursements for our research and development activities through april during and  funding of million and million  respectively  was received from medimmune 
of the amount received in  million was specifically related to the million research and development funding with the remainder comprised of external cost reimbursements 
of the amount received in  million was payment for the achievement of a contractual milestone and the remainder comprised of external cost reimbursements 
we regularly explore alternative means of financing our operations and seek funding through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  collaborative arrangements with third parties and other strategic alliances and business transactions 
we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds  and may be unable to obtain sufficient funding in the future on acceptable terms 
if we cannot obtain funding  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate research and development programs or enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize potential products or technologies that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or seek other arrangements 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
additional factors that may impact our ability to raise capital are described under risk factors 
in january  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million 
in november  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million 
we believe that the proceeds of these offerings  in addition to our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   are sufficient to meet our research and development goals and sustain operations through

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in only us government  government agency  corporate and bank or institutional money market funds with investment standards comparable to our investment policy 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure we may have to any one issue  issuer or type of investment other than us government debt 
as of december   our portfolio investments consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in us treasury or us government agency debt instruments having a maturity of less than one year 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  management believes that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average annualized yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
correspondingly  if the average annualized yield of our investments had increased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have increased by million 
this estimate assumes that the increase occurred on the first day of and increased the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
