item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we are a leading supplier of microwave products and systems to defense and aerospace entities worldwide 
our primary customers include large defense prime contractors including northrop grumman  lockheed martin  raytheon and boeing  the us government including the department of defense  nasa and other us government agencies and international customers including the egyptian  german  japanese and south korean militaries and suppliers to international militaries 
we are a leading provider of microwave technologies for use in command and control systems  flight instrumentation  weapons sensors and electronic warfare systems 
we have served the defense industry since by designing and manufacturing microwave devices for use in high technology defense electronics applications 
our products and systems are currently deployed on a wide range of high profile military platforms  including the f falcon  the f a e f super hornet  the rc rivet joint  the e c hawkeye  the aegis class surface combatants  the ea b prowler  the amraam air to air missile  and unmanned aerial vehicles  or uavs  as well as high priority national security programs such as national missile defense and the trident ii d the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
there can be no assurance that trends in sales growth or operating results will continue in the future 
weeks ended weeks ended july  august  august  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense  net investment income interest expense foreign exchange loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the weeks ended july  were approximately  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of approximately million 
net sales at our three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss  msi and ici  accounted for an increase of approximately million  or approximately three quarters of the increase for the weeks ended july  approximately million of net sales increase is attributable to cti  which was consolidated into our results for only months in fiscal  versus a full months in fiscal in addition to this impact of a full year results for cti  cti has experienced growth of greater than in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  principally due to growth at cti in sales of military products in cti s direct synthesizer products 
other than these acquisition driven impacts  our other divisions experienced a net decline in sales for the year 
the largest decline occurred in our lancaster operation with the decline in versus net sales being primarily attributable to a reduction of million in foreign sales and a reduction in revenues from the acls program of million 
our uk subsidiary  ewst  experienced a reduction in revenue of approximately million in fiscal versus fiscal  principally due to revisions to and increases in estimated costs to complete certain contracts  which resulted in a reduction in revenue recognized on these contracts 
our level of intercompany sales increased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the gross profit margin for the weeks ended july  was as compared to the margin of in fiscal a decline of 
excluding the impact of our three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss  msi and ici  the decline in gross profit margins would have been larger 
the decrease in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to the transition of several new programs from engineering development to the early stage of production  with higher engineering costs not yet offset by production revenues 
decreases of gross margins at ewst  principally due to changes in contract cost estimates at that operation versus contract cost estimates in the prior fiscal year for the same projects 
the changes in contract cost estimates were principally due to unanticipated delays in meeting technical requirements and delivery dates on certain ewst contracts 
offset by higher margins contributed by signal generation components and direct sources  principally due to the fact that the prior year included only four months of results for cti  which was acquired effective as of march  selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended july  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal  or an increase of million 
large increases during the period included increases of approximately million attributable to our three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss  msi and ici  and an increase of approximately million due to the fact that the prior year only included four months of results for cti  which was acquired effective as of march   an increase of approximately  in legal costs associated with robinson laboratories and a continuing investigation by the us attorneys office in pennsylvania which  inter alia  involves pricing under two contracts with the us department of defense relating to voltage control oscillators and a contract relating to powerheads 
we spent approximately  in out of pocket consulting fees in fiscal in connection with our sarbanes oxley section compliance program 
we expect some of these costs to continue in fiscal as a result of the above trends  our operating income for fiscal year was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal our foreign operations contributed  in operating income for the year as compared to  in fiscal revenues from our foreign operations decreased by  as compared to fiscal the drop in revenue and operating income within our foreign operations was due to revisions in total cost estimates at our ewst subsidiary in the uk 
investment income increased by  in fiscal as a result of an increase in the rate of interest earned on the investment of excess cash reserves during the fiscal year as compared to interest rates in fiscal  and a decrease on average of approximately million in funds invested 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate of in fiscal due to various favorable tax benefits 
the largest benefit was from the recognition of multi year research and development tax credits now being realized 
other benefits included a lower effective tax rate on foreign source income  the us tax benefits attributable to extra territorial income ie export sales and tax exempt interest income 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the weeks ended august  were approximately  compared to  for fiscal the net sales increase of  is attributable to increased revenue in defense electronics microwave systems and components of  including  attributable to the acquisition of cti as of march  
this increase also includes revenue from products shipped under new programs as well as increases on legacy products and programs 
net sales in commercial technologies increased by  which includes revenue attributable to the acquisition of cti of  offset by a decrease of  in medical and scientific products due to the decline in demand in the industry for nuclear magnetic resonance systems 
we expect revenues for medical products to increase and scientific products to remain relatively flat 
the gross profit margin for the weeks ended august  was as compared to the margin of in fiscal gross profit increased  primarily as a result of increased volume over fiscal and greater absorption of fixed costs 
margins also improved in microwave components due to production efficiencies  including the automation of certain processes 
this improvement was offset by lower margins on revenue relating to engineering programs which are essential for long term technology development and future revenue growth 
in addition  consolidated gross profit margins were negatively impacted by approximately one half percent due to revisions in total cost estimates including the effect of foreign exchange translations on non sterling denominated contracts at our ewst subsidiary in the uk 
selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended august  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal there was a net increase in expenses of  which includes expenses of cti of approximately  an increase of litigation costs of  directly related to the robinson labs litigation and include a payment of the jury award to ben robinson of approximately  in july see item legal proceedings  an increase in incentive compensation under employment contracts and discretionary bonuses of  and additional administrative and business development personnel and related costs of  the company reorganized and expanded its business development group to focus and capitalize on worldwide market opportunities for all of its products 
other increases include amortization of acquired intangibles of  sales representative fees and commissions of  and  in consulting fees primarily in connection with our sarbanes oxley  section preparation which will continue in fiscal income from operations for the year was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the increases in selling and administrative expenses and litigation costs as discussed above 
in addition  our foreign operations contributed  in operating income for the year as compared to  in fiscal revenues from our foreign operations decreased by  as compared to fiscal the drop in revenue and operating income within our foreign operations was due to revisions in total cost estimates including the effect of foreign exchange translations on non sterling denominated contracts at our ewst subsidiary in the uk 
investment income decreased by  in fiscal as a result of a decline in the rate of interest earned on the investment of excess cash reserves during the fiscal year as compared to interest rates in fiscal  and a decrease on average of approximately  in funds invested 
the net foreign exchange loss of  in fiscal is attributable to the weaker us dollar during the fiscal year causing our foreign denominated liabilities to increase in value  and the us dollar denominated contracts in the united kingdom to decrease in value 
in addition  we recorded an unrealized gain on us dollar denominated loans to ewst which are expected to be repaid during fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the overall effective tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate of in fiscal due to various favorable tax benefits including a lower effective tax rate on foreign source income  the tax benefit attributable to extra territorial income  and research and development credits

liquidity and capital resources as of july  and august   working capital was  and  respectively  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to  respectively 
as is customary in the defense industry  inventory is partially financed by progress payments 
in addition  it is customary for us to receive advanced payments from customers on major contracts at the time a contract is entered into 
the unliquidated balance of these advanced payments was approximately  at july   and  at august  net cash provided by operations was approximately  in fiscal as compared to  in  an increase of approximately million 
income from operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million 
significant items contributing to the increase in cash provided by operations include the following an increase of approximately million in cash generated from collection of accounts receivable during fiscal versus fiscal  a reduction of approximately million in the amount of cash invested in costs incurred and income recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  a reduction of approximately million in the amount of cash invested in inventories during fiscal versus fiscal  and other net sources of cash offset by a decrease of approximately million in cash generated through advance payments from customers on contracts during the course of fiscal  and a decrease of approximately million in cash generated from billings in excess of costs incurred and income recognized on uncompleted contracts during the course of fiscal of the changes noted in and above  the largest impact was from a major contract at our lancaster facility in connection with an upgrade for us navy aircraft 
this program was accounted for on a percentage of completion basis  and in last year s fourth quarter  we were accumulating significant costs into this contract 
the job was largely shipped during fiscal and early in fiscal  which also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable collections in fiscal net cash used in investing activities includes a net payment of million in connection with the three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss million  msi million and ici million 
see note b 
a payment of million in connection with the acquisition from xytrans of certain technology to be used in missile and millimeter wave products 
see note a capital expenditures of million including approximately million related to new expanded facilities occupied by our israel and uk operations 
the setup costs and capital expenditures associated with these new facilities are now substantially completed 
we also invested in our engineering and test facilities throughout our us operations  and expanded certain production facilities at our lancaster plant 
net cash provided by financing activities of  reflects the net impact of proceeds of from the exercise of stock options for million  offset by the purchase of treasury stock for approximately million  and the payment of the deferred purchase price of ewst 
in june  we entered into a new  revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on january  as amended 
we may elect to borrow up to a maximum of  with interest based on the federal funds target rate plus a margin of to  or up to a maximum of  with interest based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement 
the federal funds target rate and the libor rate was and  respectively  at july  there is a fee of basis points per annum on the unused portion of the  libor based portion of the credit facility payable quarterly 
there were no borrowings under the line at july  and august  stand by letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of  under the credit facility at july  we believe that presently anticipated future cash requirements will be provided by internally generated funds  our existing unsecured credit facility  and existing cash reserves 
a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal will be generated from our existing backlog of sales orders 
the backlog of orders at july  was approximately million 
all orders included in backlog are covered by signed contracts or purchase orders 
nevertheless  contracts involving government programs may be terminated at the discretion of the government 
in the event of the cancellation of a significant amount of government contracts included in our backlog  we will be required to rely more heavily on cash reserves and our existing credit facility to fund our operations 
we are not aware of any events which are reasonably likely to result in any cancellation of our government contracts 
we have approximately  available under our bank credit facility  net of outstanding stand by letters of credit of approximately  and cash reserves at july  of approximately  contractual obligations and commitments our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as purchase orders  and debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as stand by letters of credit are as follows we have outstanding an aggregate of approximately  in open purchase orders as of july  these open purchase orders represent executory contracts for the purchase of goods and services which will be substantially fulfilled in the next six months

as of july   the amount payable in the event of such termination would be approximately  the agreements also provide for consulting periods  one for five years and one for ten years  at the end of the employment period at an annual compensation equivalent to one half of the executive s annual salary at the end of the employment period  subject to annual cost of living adjustments 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
inventory costs  an amendment of apb no 
 chapter sfas sfas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt this pronouncement beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  and do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no

sfas no specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june   and is required to be adopted by the company effective august  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r is effective for publicly traded companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june   supersedes accounting principles board opinion no

sfas r will be effective for the company beginning with the first quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements for the estimated impact on net income and net income per diluted share amounts of recording share based payments in the consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock options 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
this interpretation provides additional guidance as to when companies should record the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when there is uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  we do not expect the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas sfas replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes and fasb statement no

sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that a correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our established policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies contained in part ii  item of this form k 
as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of our financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
approximately of our customer contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products sold  regardless of the costs incurred 
approximately to of revenues over the last three fiscal years were derived from long term  fixed price contracts for which revenues and estimated profits are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on estimated completion to date the total contract amount multiplied by the percentage of performance  based on total costs incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded in the period when first determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the ultimate costs and contract terms 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
under the non amortization approach in accounting for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized into results of operations but instead is reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations in the period in which the recorded value of goodwill is more than its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when an indication of impairment exists  and any impairment of goodwill is charged to operations 
an impairment test based on a single reporting unit was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal using our current market capitalization  which in an active market for our common stock  we consider a reasonable indication of implied fair value 
based on this initial step in the test for impairment  we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill at july  provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
since the acquisitions of general microwave corporation and ewst  we are subject to movements in foreign currency rate changes related to our operations in israel and in england 
the movements in the israeli shekel versus the us dollar have not been significant 
movements in pounds sterling the functional currency at ewst have been more significant 
based on our historical results and expected future results  ewst accounts for approximately to of our total revenues  based in part on the rate at which ewst s sterling denominated financial statements have been or will be converted into us dollars 
since its acquisition in fiscal year  ewst has contributed approximately to our consolidated operating income 
having a portion of our future revenue and income denominated in sterling exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future sterling denominated revenue and earnings 
we have a foreign denominated liability as of july  of approximately  pounds sterling in connection with the acquisition of ewst that is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
based on the spot rate of exchange at july  of  the us dollar equivalent of the liability is approximately  we have made inter company advances to ewst in the aggregate amount of approximately million at july  that were previously considered long term advances 
however  since the advances are denominated in us dollars and ewst anticipates reducing the amount of advances during fiscal year  the amount outstanding is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank pursuant to which it exchanged floating rate interest in connection with the bonds discussed in note h of the financial statements on a notional amount of  for a fixed rate of for a year period ending october  the notional amount reduces each year in tandem with the annual installments due on the bonds 
the fixing of the interest rate for this period offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates on the bonds  and as such has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and any ineffectiveness will be recognized in interest expense in the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately  as of july  there was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges during the fiscal years presented to be recognized in earnings 
we also have a  revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on january  we may elect to borrow up to a maximum of  with interest based on the federal funds target rate plus a margin of to  or up to a maximum of  with interest based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement 
the federal funds target rate and the libor rate was and  respectively  at july  the credit line is reviewed on an annual basis 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of july  the table below provides information about our debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
future principal payment cash flows by maturity date as required under the industrial revenue bonds  and corresponding fair value is as follows fiscal year ending bonds and later  fair value  we do not anticipate any other material changes in its primary market risk exposures in fiscal
