item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding financial and geographical information relating to our business segments 
the office imaging industry in which we have traditionally participated in the united states is generally represented by the following six black and white digital segments  two color segments and a new category of color capable systems that are designed to produce primarily black white images  and have the added capability to produce office color images at lower speeds 

table of contents segment cpm principal manufacturers xerox  sharp  canon  mita  ricoh  konica minolta canon  ricoh  mita  konica minolta canon  xerox  sharp  ricoh canon  ricoh  konica minolta  xerox  sharp ricoh  canon  xerox  konica minolta ricoh  canon  lanier  xerox  kodak nexpress office color canon  xerox  ricoh  konica minolta production color canon  xerox  ricoh  konica minolta color capable canon  xerox  ricoh copies per minute source international data corporation there are several trends that are prevalent in the office imaging industry  including evolution of office workflow process 
the process of distributing information in the workplace has evolved over recent years through technological advances in communication  most notably electronic document delivery via e mail and the internet 
while documents have traditionally been produced on a copier and then distributed to the relevant working groups  electronic document delivery has allowed documents to first be distributed electronically and then printed by the end user on the printer linked to the end user s personal computer or stored for later use 
this evolution has led to the rapid growth of printed documents from desktop and network printers 
copier volume has remained relatively flat and competition from non traditional copier companies  such as manufacturers of desktop and network printers  has increased 
however  recent trends in the application and networking of computer systems throughout the entire office have begun to enable the migration of printed material to the most efficient or cost effective device  which often includes connected digital copiers and mfps 
shift from selling boxes to selling solutions 
the growth in the volume of documents printed from lower volume  desktop and network printers has substantially increased end users per image cost for printed material 
the ability of digital copiers and mfps to be connected to the information technology network has provided an opportunity for end users to reduce their per image costs while optimizing the use of their imaging equipment 
as companies look to reduce costs  they are increasingly requesting comprehensive solutions from their document imaging vendors 
these solutions involve both equipment and related software and service offerings that allow them to better meet their document imaging needs  and optimize the use of their installed equipment 
as such  most leading document imaging vendors are moving away from the analog box sale approach to one of being a provider of solutions that can satisfy their customers print management needs on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
increasing demand for color 
customers continue to demand high performance machines that produce presentation quality documents  leading to an interest in and demand for color equipment 
the emergence of digital copiers  mfps and lower cost color capable copiers allows companies to increase their level of in house document production and produce presentation quality copies for meetings  presentations and mailings 
although the transition to color is expected to be gradual according to industry sources  it represents an important and growing segment of the market  offering higher revenue growth for companies in the office imaging industry than the black and white market due to the higher cost of color capable equipment and related consumable supplies 
the demand for color systems and products continues to grow  and additional manufacturers are entering the market 
as a result  we expect the transactional average selling price to decline going forward 

table of contents products and services office imaging systems we offer a large selection of the top brands of office imaging products as part of our document solutions packages 
these products represent a full complement of digital and color copiers  digital and color mfps and facsimile machines  as well as print management software and related parts and supplies 
in the united states  we sell high volume segments and products  which include the kodak nexpress digimaster  canon ir  as well as the toshiba e studio series of digital products 
in the mid volume segments and  we sell the full range of canon ir and toshiba e studio series digital copiers and mfps 
in the color segment  we sell the canon clc series of products as well as the toshiba e studio line of color products 
in addition  we sell a full complement of front end print server equipment and a portfolio of applications software which enhances the features and functions of the equipment 
for example  among other things  certain of these software products convert paper information to digital formats and allow the reproduction of documents in a variety of formats  help customers acquire  manage  store and retrieve documents in a secure manner  permit the scanning of paper documents and importation of electronic files and emails  and allow for smart distribution of print jobs across a range of printing devices 
in europe  we sell the kodak nexpress digimaster  as well as high volume products manufactured by ricoh under our infotec brand name  canon  toshiba and hewlett packard 
we also sell a full range of ricoh infotec and canon ir products in the mid volume range in europe  where we also sell a full portfolio of print server equipment and software with the capabilities described above 
we sell a variety of products in our non us americas segment  where in most countries we have regional relationships with equipment manufacturers 
for example  in canada we sell primarily canon and toshiba digital equipment 
in mexico  we sell toshiba digital products and  like some of the other latin america countries which have been slower to make the analog to digital transition  we market refurbished equipment primarily on a rental basis 
we are beginning to market solutions and software in some of these countries where we have been able to establish a base of digital equipment 
technical services we also offer a broad range of field technical services which primarily involve the service and maintenance of our mif 
our worldwide network of field engineers is dedicated to ensuring that customers get maximum up time from their investment in our office imaging systems

field engineers have access to a computerized warehouse system that stocks thousands of parts for immediate delivery to customers  and are equipped with laptop computers which contain reference materials and diagnostic software to assist with the early resolution of customer issues 
in the large majority of our sales of office imaging systems  our customers also purchase a service contract which gives them access to our field technical engineers 
we also receive referrals for technical services from oems for products they sell 
this gives our customers immediate access to the best possible response to issues pertaining to their equipment  networking platforms  applications software and operating systems 
our technical services organization gives us broad service capabilities in the locations in which we do business and a competitive advantage as it allows us to offer our services on a multinational basis 
we generally offer our technical services pursuant to contracts 
our service and supply contracts typically have an initial term of one to three years in the us and four to five years in europe and renew on an annual basis thereafter 
new systems  as designed by manufacturers  are increasingly incorporating new technology into their mfps  that permit field maintenance to be performed by replacing key components with field replaceable units  or frus 
this trend may result in customer s requesting additional flexibility in their maintenance contracts that permit higher levels of self maintenance or time and materials engagements  and may impact the company s service revenue model

competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we have competitors in all markets in which we operate  and our competitors include a number of companies worldwide with significant technological  distribution and financial resources 
competition in our industry is based largely upon technology  performance  pricing  quality  reliability  distribution  customer service and support and lease and rental financing 
in addition  our equipment suppliers continue to establish themselves as direct competitors in many of the areas in which we do business 
some manufacturers of products in our industry have been consolidating in an attempt to gain market share and reduce costs 
as such  the availability of certain products may become constrained or such products may become unavailable 
such consolidations may negatively impact our relationships with certain of our partners within the industry 
besides competition from within the office imaging industry  we are also experiencing competition from other sources as a result of evolving technology  including the development of alternative means of document processing  retention  storage and printing 
our retail operations are in direct competition with local and regional equipment suppliers and dealers  manufacturers  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
we have suffered  and may continue to suffer  a reduction of our market share because of the high level of competition in our industry 
the intense competition in our industry may result in pressure on the prices and margins that we can obtain for our products and may affect our ability to retain customers 
seasonality we have experienced some seasonality in our business 
our european and canadian operations have historically experienced lower revenue for the second quarter of our fiscal year  which is the three month period ended september th 
this is primarily due to increased vacation time by european and canadian residents during july and august 
this has historically resulted in reduced sales activity and reduced usage of photocopiers  facsimiles and other office imaging equipment during that period 
employees as of march   we employed approximately  persons  with approximately  in our americas segment and approximately  in our europe australia segment 
some of our non us employees are subject to labor agreements that  among other things  establish rates of pay and working hours 
we believe that we provide working conditions and wages that are comparable to those of our competitors 
trademarks and service marks we believe that our trademarks and service marks have gained recognition in the office imaging and document management industry and are important to our marketing efforts 
we have registered various trademarks and service marks 
in particular  we believe that the trademarks danka  infotec  techsource and danka the desktop are important to our ongoing business 
our policy is to continue to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to vigorously oppose any infringement of our proprietary rights 
depending on the jurisdiction  trademarks and service marks are valid as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained  and they have not been found to become generic 
registrations of trademarks and service marks in the united states can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use 
backlog backlogs are not material to our business 

table of contents item properties our general policy is to lease  rather than own  our business locations 
we lease numerous properties for administration  sales  service and distribution functions and for our retail and wholesale operations 
as of march   our principal facilities include  square feet of leased office space in st 
petersburg  florida that we use for our us and corporate operations 
the terms vary under the leases 
some of our leases contain a right of first refusal or an option to purchase the underlying real property and improvements 
in general  our lease agreements require us to pay our proportionate share of taxes  common area expenses  insurance and related costs of the rental properties 
our management believes that the properties we occupy are  in general  suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 
item legal proceedings in june  we were served with a putative class action complaint titled stephen l 
edwards  et al  plaintiffs vs danka industries  inc  et al  including american business credit corporation  defendants  alleging claims of breach of contract  fraud intentional misrepresentation  unjust enrichment  violation of the florida deception and unfair trade protection act and seeking injunctive relief 
the claim was filed in the state court in tennessee  and we have removed the claim to the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee for further proceedings 
the plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the class  which we have opposed 
we have filed a motion for summary judgment  which plaintiffs have opposed 
while the amount sought in the complaint is in excess of  we cannot  at this time  estimate its potential exposure 
we intend to vigorously defend all claims alleged by the plaintiffs 
we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we do not expect these legal proceedings to have a material effect upon our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

we most recently paid a dividend to shareholders on july  we are an english company and we currently have insufficient profits  as determined under english law  to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 
in addition  we are not currently permitted to pay dividends  other than payment in kind dividends on our participating shares  under our senior credit facility 
we do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future and any decision to do so will be made by our board of directors in light of our earnings  financial position  capital requirements  credit agreements  legal requirements and other such factors as our board of directors deems relevant 

table of contents item selected financial data the following selected consolidated financial and other data table sets forth our selected historical consolidated financial data for each of the fiscal years in the five year period ended march   which were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements

table of contents footnotes to selected financial data for fiscal year we cannot provide a meaningful split of service  supplies and rental revenues as it is impracticable to do so 
during fiscal year  we determined that based on changes in our business environment and an analysis of projected cash flows  the carrying amount of certain goodwill and other long lived assets in europe australia would not be recoverable 
accordingly  the resulting analysis necessitated a goodwill write down of million 
during fiscal year  we determined that based on changes in our business environment and an analysis of projected cash flows  the carrying amount of certain goodwill and other long lived assets in the united states and australia would not be recoverable

based on revenue  we are one of the largest independent providers of office imaging equipment  document solutions and related services and supplies in the americas and europe australia 
we offer a wide range of state of the art office imaging products  peripherals and solutions that primarily include digital and color copiers  digital and color multi function peripherals mfps  facsimile machines and software 
we also provide a wide range of contract services  including professional and consulting services  maintenance  supplies  leasing arrangements  technical support and training on the installed base of equipment created primarily by our retail equipment and related sales and have increased our contract services to include multi vendor equipment and comprehensive solutions to companies printing needs 
we currently operate in over countries 
our reportable segments are the americas and europe australia  which include operations that are experiencing political  social and or economic difficulty 
we continue to evaluate the viability and future prospects of the operations in certain countries in light of uncertain conditions 
based on these evaluations  during the year ended march   we exited operations in portugal and russia 
the impact of these exit plans is immaterial to our business  financial condition  results of operations and our competitive position 
should we decide to downsize or exit any of our other operations in the future  we could incur costs in respect of severance and closure of facilities and we may also be required to realize cumulative translation losses and minimum pension liabilities that would reduce our earnings  all or any of which may have a material impact on our operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply various accounting policies 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide allowances for doubtful accounts and allowances for billing disputes and inaccuracies on its accounts receivable as follows allowances for doubtful accounts credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is generally not required 
some of the factors that we consider in determining whether to record an allowance against accounts receivable include the age of the receivable  historical write off experience and current economic conditions 
allowances for billing disputes and inaccuracies because of the difficulties we experience in accurately recording the number of copies made by customers  entering contract information into our system and timely identifying and correcting billing errors  we reduce revenue for an estimate of future credits that will be issued for billing disputes and billing inaccuracies at the time of sale 
these estimates are established based on our historical experience of write offs and credits 
table of contents issued for billing disputes and inaccuracies and are influenced by a number of considerations  including but not limited to the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas and the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of our net sales 
the following table summarizes our net accounts receivable march  march  accounts receivable  gross allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts as a of gross accounts receivable during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the availability of increased historical information  we changed our estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing disputes and inaccuracies 
the result of this change in estimate was an increase to net loss of million and in increase in net loss per ads available to common shareholders of 
inventories we acquire inventory based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any unexpected decline in demand and or rapid product improvements or technological changes may cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
we have provided appropriate reserves against these inventory items in current and prior periods 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions using historical trends and analysis 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts due  in part  to a greater acceleration within the industry to digital office imaging equipment  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates are influenced by a number of considerations including  but not limited to  the following decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  and our ability to return to vendors a certain percentage of our purchases 
revenue recognition wholesale and retail equipment and related sales are recognized upon acceptance of delivery by the customer 
in the case of equipment sales financed by third party finance leasing companies  retail equipment and related sales are recognized upon acceptance of delivery by the customer and credit acceptance by the finance leasing company  if later 
in addition  for the sale of certain digital equipment that requires a comprehensive setup by us before it can be used by a customer  such as a heidelberg or equivalent type of equipment  revenue is recognized upon acceptance of delivery and installation by the customer and written confirmation of installation by a company representative 
supply sales to customers are recognized at the time of shipment unless supply sales are included in a service contract  in which case supply sales are recognized upon equipment usage by the customer 
rental operating lease income is recognized straight line over the lease term 
retail service revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the underlying maintenance contracts 
under the terms of the retail service contract  the customer is billed a flat periodic charge and or a usage based fee 
we record revenue for the flat periodic charge each period and for actual or estimated usage every period 
we generally bundle a customer service agreement with equipment when sold 
the typical agreement includes an allowance for a minimum number of copies for a base service fee plus an overage charge for any copies in excess of the minimum 
revenue for each element of a bundled contract is derived from our national price lists for equipment and service 
the national price lists for equipment includes a price range between the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp and the minimum price for which our sales force is permitted to sell equipment without prior approval from a higher level of management within our field services organization 
the price lists for equipment are updated periodically to reflect changes in msrp and any changes in the fair value for which equipment is being sold to customers 
the national price lists for service reflects the price of service charged to customers 
the price lists for service are updated periodically to reflect changes in the competitive environment affecting the fair value for which service is being provided to customers 
the national price lists  therefore  are representative of the fair value of each element of a bundled agreement when it is sold unaccompanied by the other elements 
revenue for a bundled contract is allocated to service revenue and equipment revenue using the fair values indicated by our national price lists 
cost of sales inbound freight charges are included in inventory 
when the inventory is sold  the cost of the inventory  including the inbound freight charges  is relieved and charged to costs of sales 
when the inventory is rented  the cost of the 
table of contents inventory  including the inbound freight charges  is relieved and transferred to the rental equipment asset account 
the cost of the rental equipment asset is then depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
the depreciation of rental equipment assets is included in rental costs 
purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs and other distribution costs are included in selling  service and administrative costs because no meaningful allocation of these expenses to equipment  supplies  rental and wholesale costs of sales is practicable 
accordingly  our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales  while others exclude a portion of them from gross margin  including them instead in operating expense line items 
these costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
we receive vendor rebates based on arrangements with certain vendors 
those arrangements require them to make incentive payments to the company based on the volume of purchases dollar amounts  quantity of specific units  etc 
for monthly or quarterly periods 
such rebates are accrued when purchases are made and can be reasonable estimated  recorded as reductions of inventory costs when accrued and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the related inventories are sold 
deferred income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to estimate our income and corporation taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense and loss carryforwards together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and loss carryforwards may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
our past financial performance is a significant factor which contributes to our inability  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to use projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
management therefore is limited to considering the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
due to the inability to use projections of future taxable income in making its assessment  management concluded that it is not more likely than not we will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets at march  consequently  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions at march  in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income and corporation taxes have been made for all years 
goodwill we had goodwill of million as of march  we review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for possible impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill was reviewed for possible impairment as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing our impairment testing  we engaged an independent appraisal company to assist in the valuation of our reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units were determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a guideline company method using valuation multiples 
the discounted cash flow model used estimates of future revenue and expenses for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates  and the estimates that were used are consistent with the plans and estimates the company is using to manage the underlying business 
based on this analysis  management determined that the goodwill balance was impaired for its europe australia reporting unit 
as such  additional goodwill impairment testing was completed for that reporting unit  and based on those results  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
accounting for stock based compensation as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we account for our stock option plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
as the exercise prices of all options granted under these plans were equal to the market price of the underlying american depositary shares ads on the grant date  no stock based employee compensation expense was recognized in net earnings 
in general  these options expire in ten years and vest over three years 
the proceeds from options exercised are credited to shareholders equity deficit  net of related tax benefits 
for disclosure purposes  we compute the impact to earnings loss of stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model 
sfas allows the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in the opinion of management  the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options 

table of contents in december  the financial accounting standard s board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas and supersedes apb  and its related guidance 
sfas r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award in the statement of operations 
pro forma disclosure is no longer allowable under the new standard 
adoption of sfas r by us is required as of the beginning of fiscal year we have not yet assessed the impact the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges we recognized restructuring charges for the consolidation of back office functions  exiting non strategic real estate facilities and reducing headcount 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
these charges were accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and the recognition of restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring charges credits to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
all tables presented herein are in thousands unless otherwise noted 
controls and procedures management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march  based upon this assessment and as more fully explained in item a controls and procedures  management identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of march  during the testing phase  management began developing remediation plans and is in the process of finalizing those plans 
once remediation plans are finalized  timelines where determinable will be established to complete those plans 
financial condition march  march  total assets total liabilities working capital liabilities to liabilities and capital inventory turnover ratio x x total assets as of march  decreased million or  from march  this decrease was primarily from a goodwill impairment of million  decreased accounts receivable resulting from decreased revenues  a decrease in cash of million to fund operations  including the acquisition of a regional print service provider and a decrease in fixed assets of million due to the continuing depreciation of the assets and the decrease in capital spending during the year 
total liabilities increased million  or primarily due an increase in accounts payable of million offset by a decrease in taxes payable of million due to favorable tax audits settlements in our european jurisdictions and a decrease in deferred revenue of million due to declining service revenue

table of contents the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of growth decline of total revenue for each of our operating segments year ended march  americas europe australia the following tables set forth for the periods indicated the gross profit margin percentage and operating earnings loss from continuing operations margin as a percentage of sales for each of our operating segments year ended march  gross profit margin americas europe australia operating earnings loss margin americas europe australia fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue in fiscal year  our revenue decreased by million or from fiscal year  with the americas segment decreasing million or and europe australia down million or 
this decrease was the result of a decline in retail service revenue due to a decline in machines in field mif and lower average monthly copy and usage values due to the continuing industry wide conversion from analog to digital equipment  a decline in overall sales coverage in our americas operations due to restructuring efforts aimed at reducing our cost structure  and a decline in retail equipment and related sales revenue from our americas enterprise and national accounts 
our revenue for fiscal year was positively impacted by million of foreign currency movement  of which million was attributable to europe australia and million was attributable to non us locations of our americas segment 
during fiscal year  of our total revenue was generated by our americas segment and by our europe australia segment  compared to and  respectively  during fiscal year our fiscal year retail equipment and related sales declined by million or to million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  with the americas down million or 
this decrease in the americas segment is the result of declining revenue streams from our enterprise and national accounts sales channels due to the maturation of existing accounts and increased competition in these channels 
our intention is to make up for the shortfall by increasing sales coverage in certain of our americas sales channels  though we have had difficulty hiring and retaining qualified sales personnel 
this and the advent of other competitive equipment from printer manufacturers may continue to hinder our progress in growing retail equipment and related sales revenue in the americas segment 
retail equipment and related sales revenue in the europe australia segment was up million or 
this increase in the europe australia segment is attributed to positive foreign currency movement of million or during the year 
we have experienced turn over in our uk sales force which has negatively impacted revenue in the segment  and we have had difficulty hiring and retaining qualified sales personnel 
this may continue to hinder our progress in growing retail equipment and related sales revenue in the europe australia segment 
retail service revenue declined by million or to million due largely to the decrease in retail equipment and related sales  lower mif and lower usage volume 
the americas segment was down million or 
this decrease in the americas segment is a direct result of the continued decline in our mif and a decline in our average monthly per machine copy volumes 
during fiscal year  we strategically reduced the number of service personnel in the field which caused some declines in our mif and the revenue therefrom 
we have numerous initiatives underway  including our tech source multi vendor services strategy  to stem the decline in our retail service revenue 
however  if these initiatives are not successful and our mif and usage continue to decline  our service revenues may continue to decline 

table of contents retail service revenue in the europe australia segment was down million or 
revenues declined million primarily due to ongoing service declines in the uk  germany and france as a result of reduced mif and a de emphasis on rental investments 
this decrease was partially offset by a positive foreign currency movement of million or 
retail supplies and rental revenue declined by million or to million 
the decline in our revenue was primarily due to the transition in our industry from analog to digital products and the resulting lower retail placements  reduced mif  increased competition as a result of technology convergence  such as the advent of mfps  and an increase in the migration of copy volume from copiers to network printers and weaker global economic conditions which resulted in reduced or delayed capital spending by customers 
retail supplies and rental revenues in the americas segment was down million or in fiscal year supplies decreased in the americas segment primarily due to the decline in our kodak analog base 
the kodak base uses a proprietary supply product and that page volume is rapidly moving to digital  a natural but negative consequence of the analog to digital transition 
rental revenue decreased due to strategic initiatives to de emphasize investment in rental equipment as leases expire  and our lack of investment in new rental placements is likely to continue downward pressure in these revenue streams 
this initiative reduces cash outlays for such equipment 
retail supplies and rental revenue in the europe australia segment was down million or 
this decrease in total retail supplies and rental revenue for the europe australia segment was primarily due to our strategic initiatives to de emphasize investment in rental equipment as mentioned above 
this decrease was partially offset by a positive foreign currency movement of million or 
wholesale revenue decreased million or during the current fiscal year to million 
during fiscal year  we changed the it platform of our wholesale business to oracle and moved the physical location of the administration center 
while these changes that  in the long term  will provide a much improved infrastructure for our wholesale business  in the short term these changes have negatively impacted our ability to accept  process and deliver customer orders  which has resulted in lower sales 
gross profit our total gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal year from in the year ago period 
the decrease in our gross profit margin is primarily due to a faster decline in our retail service revenue than our planned headcount reductions as part of our restructuring plans 
also during the year  our gross margins were negatively impacted by approximately million due to a decrease in the amount of vendor rebates earned 
the gross profit margin for the americas segment decreased to from and the europe australia segment remained stable at 
margins could continue to be impacted if we are not successful in slowing or reversing the declines in our retail equipment and retail service revenues 
the retail equipment and related sales margin decreased to from in the year ago period 
margins increased in our americas segment due to lower national and enterprise revenues which tend to have low margins 
this increase was offset by lower europe australia margins due to pricing competition and sales force turnover 
retail service margins decreased to from in the year ago period primarily due to lower revenues offset by lower parts and labor costs 
retail supplies and rental margins increased slightly to from 
margins increased primarily related to the de emphasis on investment in rental equipment  which resulted in lower depreciation costs for the quarter 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in supplies margins in the americas segment due to the decline in our kodak analog base which generally has higher margins 
wholesale margins decreased to from in the year ago period due to a shift toward lower margin business in an effort to win back customer loyalty resulting from poor execution on deliveries to customers due to back office constraints 
our conversion to our oracle system will help to alleviate these constraints  even though we experienced some difficulties due to the implementation of the system 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by million or from the year ago period to million 
sg a increased due to sarbanes oxley compliance costs of million during fiscal year  additional bad debt during the year of approximately million  million relating to other consulting services and a foreign currency movement which increased sg a by or million 
these increases were partially offset by ongoing cost reduction efforts and the progress in the implementation of our worldwide cost reduction program 
the cost reduction program allowed us to reduce our compensation expense by approximately million and lower our facility costs by approximately million 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses increased to from due to lower revenues in fiscal year 
table of contents restructuring charges credits in fiscal year  we formulated plans to continue to eliminate inefficiencies in our field operations and to reduce our sg a costs by eliminating and consolidating back office functions and exiting certain facilities 
as part of these plans  we recorded a million restructuring charge in fiscal year comprised of severance charges of million and facility closure charges of million 
the fiscal year restructuring charge was partially offset by a million reversal of prior years restructuring charges as a result of employee attrition and a change in restructuring plans offset by higher than originally estimated facility closure costs 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we formulated plans to significantly reduce our sg a costs by consolidating our back office functions in the united states  exiting non strategic real estate facilities and reducing headcount in the americas and europe australia 
as part of those plans  we recorded a million restructuring charge in fiscal year that included million related to severance for employees and million related to future lease obligations for facilities 
the fiscal year restructuring charges were partially offset by a million reversal of prior years restructuring charges 
we expected to realize between million and million in connection with the fiscal year restructuring plan 
management believes substantially all of these savings have been realized through lower personnel and facility related costs during fiscal year impairment charges goodwill was reviewed for possible impairment as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
in performing our impairment testing  we engaged an independent appraisal company to assist in the valuation of our reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units were determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a guideline company method using valuation multiples 
the discounted cash flow model used estimates of future revenue and expenses for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates  and the estimates that were used are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
based on this analysis  management determined that the goodwill balance was impaired for its europe australia reporting unit 
as such  additional goodwill impairment testing was completed for that reporting unit  and based on those results  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
other income expense other expense was million compared to other expense of million in the year ago period 
other expense consisted primarily of a foreign currency gain of million offset by a loss associated with the exit of our subsidiaries in portugal and russia of million 
other expense for the prior year period included a million write off of trademark costs associated with the kodak acquisition offset by a foreign currency gain of million 
operating earnings loss the operating loss was million in fiscal year versus earnings of million in fiscal year the decline in the operating loss was primarily due to the million impairment charge and lower gross profit of million  offset by lower restructuring charges in the current fiscal year 
interest expense and interest income interest expense decreased by million to million 
the decrease was due to a lower effective interest rate on our indebtedness in part because of the refinancing of our debt in july income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year compared to tax expense of million in the prior year period 
the tax benefit for the current period is primarily related to favorable settlements of tax audits in our european operations partially offset by increases in tax liabilities in the us additionally  we did not recognize a tax benefit on the current year operating losses due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit on the losses incurred in most jurisdictions 
in profitable jurisdictions  income tax expense was recognized 
in the prior year period  we increased our valuation allowance due to losses incurred from continuing operations of million  offset by earning from continuing operations in fiscal years and of million and million respectively 
further  tax planning strategies taken into account in prior periods became unavailable due to overall lack of group profitability and tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions and  therefore  were no longer available at march

our retail service revenue declined by million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year with the americas down million or and europe australia up million or 
the overall decrease was due to the continuing industry wide conversion from analog to digital equipment 
partially offsetting the overall revenue decline was a foreign currency benefit of million in europe australia and million in the non us americas 
our retail supplies and rentals revenue declined by million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year with the americas segment down million or and europe australia up million or 
the overall decrease was primarily due to the past downsizing of the capital intensive rental business

gross profit for fiscal year  our consolidated gross profit decreased million or from fiscal year with consolidated gross profit margin decreasing to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the primary reasons for the decrease in our consolidated gross profit margin were due to a shift in the mix of our sales toward lower margin  large enterprise accounts in the americas  lower margins for our retail supplies and rental activity and a decrease in americas equipment leasing income of million related to lease and residual equipment payments from a diminishing external lease funding program which contributed million to gross margins in the year ago period 
this gross margin decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amount of vendor rebates earned of approximately million during the year 
the gross profit margin for the americas segment decreased slightly to from while the europe australia segment remained stable at 
the total gross profit percentage for the year ago period was adversely affected by a million charge that consisted primarily of write downs of inventory and residual values in canada

interest income was flat at million 
income taxes our income tax expense was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the effective income tax rate was negative for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the increase in the tax expense and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax asset during fiscal year this increase in the valuation allowance was required due to the following during fiscal years and  we reported earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million and million  respectively

further  tax planning strategies taken into account in prior periods became unavailable due to overall lack of group profitability and tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions and  therefore  were no longer available at march  accordingly  in assessing all factors  we determined that sufficient positive evidence did not exist at march  to counteract this significant negative evidence and that it was not more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets at march  net earnings loss our net loss was million in fiscal year  compared to net income of million in fiscal year due to the million restructuring charge  the million write off of debt issuance costs  the million write off of deferred tax assets and the million decrease in gross profit

if  by december   we have not converted or otherwise redeemed the participating shares  we are required  subject to compliance with applicable laws and the instruments governing our indebtedness  and except as set out immediately following to redeem the participating shares for cash at the greater of a the then liquidation value or b the then market value of the ordinary shares into which the participating shares are convertible  in each case plus accumulated and unpaid dividends from the most recent dividend payment date 
if the price set out in b above is applicable  we are permitted to convert the participating shares into the number of ordinary shares into which they are convertible instead of making the cash payment 
we will be required on december  to redeem all of the then outstanding participating shares 
if we fail to do this  we must then redeem the maximum number of such shares that can then lawfully be redeemed  assuming that the liquidation value per participating share is at that time greater that the market value of the ordinary shares into which the participating shares are convertible 
english company law to which we are subject  as an english corporation requires that the participating shares may be redeemed only out of our accumulated  realized profits as described below  and generally described under english law as distributable profits or  subject to some restrictions  the proceeds of a new issuance of shares for the purposes of financing the redemption 
we currently estimate that  as of december   the liquidation value of the then outstanding participating shares will be approximately million 
to the extent that we are legally permitted to do so  and except where a majority of our board of directors decided bona fide that to do so would be materially prejudicial to the business of the subsidiary undertaking  we are required to use our best efforts to ensure that our subsidiary undertakings distribute to us a sufficient amount of their profits  if any  to enable us to redeem the convertible participating shares 
if we have insufficient distributable profits on december  to redeem the participating shares in full  we will be required to use our best efforts to complete a fresh issue of shares and use the proceeds of that fresh issue to finance the redemption 
as of the date of this document  we have no distributable profits 
however  in determining whether we are able to issue new shares  we may take into account then prevailing market conditions and other factors deemed reasonable by a majority of our board of directors  and we will not be required to issue new shares to the extent prohibited by our then existing indebtedness  whether under our principal bank credit facilities or pursuant to debt securities issued in an aggregate principal amount in excess of million in a bona fide underwritten public offering or in a bona fide private offering 
in the event that we are unable to redeem all of the then outstanding participating shares on december   we are required to redeem so many of the shares as we are able  pro rata among the holders of the participating shares 
any participating shares that are not so redeemed shall remain outstanding  but shall thereafter be entitled to dividends at an increased rate of per annum until redemption 
in addition  the holders of the remaining participating shares shall be entitled to elect an additional two directors to our board of directors until the participating shares are redeemed in full 
in the event of liquidation of danka  participating shareholders will be entitled to receive a distribution equal to the greater of a the liquidation return per share initially  and subject to upward adjustment on certain default events by us plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends accumulating from the most recent dividend date or b the amount that would have been payable on each participating share if it had been converted into ordinary shares if the market value of those shares exceed the liquidation value of the participating shares 
we are likely either to pursue alternative financing arrangements or modifications in relation to the relevant requirements in relation both to the redemption of the participating shares and to the maturity of the million of senior notes due in june in order to manage our liquidity and capital requirements beyond those dates 
general electric capital corporation we have an agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc under which gecc agrees to provide financing to our qualified united states customers to purchase equipment 
the agreement expires march  in connection with this agreement  we are obligated to provide a minimum level of customer leases to gecc 
the minimum level of customer leases is equal to a specified percentage of united states retail equipment and related sales revenues

table of contents tax payments we have not paid substantial amounts of income tax in the prior three years because of our net operating losses in most jurisdictions 
we are subject to audits by multiple tax authorities with respect to prior years and certain of these audits are in the latter stages 
where we disagree with any of these positions adopted by the tax authorities  we may formally protest them 
we expect to pay between million and million to certain european tax authorities within fiscal year principally as a result of audits nearing settlement  as well as recurring operations 
in addition  we could be required to pay amounts  which could be material  during the next months  as a result of other tax audits and settlements

the revised standard mandates additional required disclosures for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans and is designed to improve disclosure transparency within financial statements and requires certain disclosures to be made on a quarterly basis 
the revised standard replaces existing pension disclosure requirements 
compliance with sfas revised was generally effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  however  since all of the required disclosures relate to our international plans  the implementation rules were effective for our fiscal year ending march  the adoption of sfas revised did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  participating securities and the two class method under fas  earnings per share eitf 
eitf requires the use of the two class method in calculating basic earnings per share by issuers with participating convertible securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk and interest rates on debt 
interest rate risk our market risk is primarily limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to our borrowings under our credit facility  while the senior notes and the subordinated notes bear a fixed rate 
we have outstanding million of subordinated notes that have a fixed annual interest rate of and interest payments of million for the subordinated notes will be paid every six month on april and october the subordinated notes mature on april  we have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that have a fixed annual interest rate of and interest payments of million for the senior notes will be paid every six months on june and december the senior notes mature on june  we also have a credit facility with fleet capital corporation that expires on january   to provide a million  senior secured revolving credit facility  which includes a million sublimit for standby and documentary letters of credit 
the fleet credit facility will bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option a the sum of the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by fleet national bank as its prime or base rate of interest plus the applicable margin thereon or b the sum of libor for interest periods at our option of one  two  three or six months plus the applicable margin thereon 
on december   we entered into a one year letter of credit facility with abn 
on november   the agreement was amended to provide us a letter of credit facility for euro million us million and an open term credit facility of euro million us million available for general working capital purposes  including overdrafts 
this facility is secured by certain of our netherlands subsidiaries assets 
the availability of this credit facility is subject to a borrowing base and complying with certain requirements  including maintaining certain levels of tangible net worth requirements as defined by the lender 
the borrowing base totaled approximately euro million us million as of march  and we had no borrowings under the facility 
based on calculations as of march   we were in compliance with the terms of the amended agreement

foreign currency exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe  canada  south america  central america and australia represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to solely isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
at march   we had no outstanding forward contracts or option contracts to buy or sell foreign currency 
for the three year period ended march   there were no gains or losses included in our consolidated statements of operations on forward contracts and option contracts 
assets and liabilities are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and the british pound sterling versus the us dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 

table of contents seasonality we have experienced some seasonality in our business 
our european and canadian operations have historically experienced lower revenue for the second quarter of our fiscal year  which is the three month period ended september th 
this is primarily due to increased vacation time by european and canadian residents during july and august 
this has historically resulted in reduced sales activity and reduced usage of photocopiers  facsimiles and other office imaging equipment during that period
