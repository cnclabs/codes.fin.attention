item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
in management s opinion  the unfavorable extraordinary event in q of increasing the company s litigation reserve and the favorable extraordinary events in q and q of recognizing the tyco patent infringement damages have an impact on the income statements that does not allow a meaningful comparison of financial ratios and other financial measures with prior periods 
consequently  item md a adjusts out the following items related to the extraordinary events  prior to making comparisons income statement extraordinary item  
for year ended extraordinary items  
for year ended note comparison of balance sheet items and roe do include the extraordinary items 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  in year end assets in both years were substantially higher than in prior years due to the extraordinary tyco patent infringement damages  reflected in cash and investments in year end and receivables in year end the change in total assets was not related to sales activity 
it reflected the difference in the tyco damages due utmd at the end of and the cash and investment balances resulting from the damages at the end of after income taxes on the extraordinary income had been paid 
the same statement applies to the net change in current assets 
in  total asset turns will depend primarily on utmd s use of its cash and investment balances 
although other current asset categories netted out to remain about the same  ending inventory balances were about lower and receivables were about higher 
as a result  average inventory turns increased to in from in despite a decline in sales activity 
management expects to sustain inventory turns in because year ending accounts receivable a r balances increased  calculated average days in a r aging was on december  based on q shipment activity 
although this is well within management s objective of days  it is less favorable than at the end of a r over days from invoice date were about of total a r at year end  compared to at year end the company believes these older a r are collectible or within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end both amounts far exceed utmd s working capital needs for normal operations 
utmd s current ratio increased to from  due mainly to the decrease in income taxes due resulting from the extraordinary items 
working capital balances and current ratio will depend primarily upon the timing and extent of use of cash and investment balances 
the non cash and investment components of working capital are expected to remain within management targets 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  oregon and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and the utah and ireland facilities 
utmd leases the oregon facility  involved in the cmi acquisition  and a portion of the midvale parking lot 
in  pp e depreciation of exceeded new pp e asset purchases of net pp e assets  however  increased compared to the end of because of a increase in dollar valued ireland pp e assets 
in  the us dollar usd declined in value relative to the euro by about 
slightly higher consolidated pp e in us dollar terms and lower sales resulted in a slightly lower pp e turn 
in  depreciation of fixed assets is expected to exceed new fixed asset purchases required to sustain current operations  which will improve pp e asset turns unless the us dollar continues to weaken  further inflating the dollar value of ireland pp e 
the current book value of consolidated pp e is of acquisition cost 
management believes that pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity 
intangible assets are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other technology rights 
net intangible assets nia increased to  at the end of from  at the end of the  goodwill portion of nia at the end of is the result of three acquisitions in  and which were made in cash at conservative valuations 
goodwill increased in as a result of the acquisition of abcorp medical  utmd s supplier of fetal monitoring belts 
the increase in goodwill was offset by amortization of other intangible assets 
as of the end of  goodwill on the balance sheet has been reduced by from the goodwill resulting at time of acquisition 
the reduction is a result of utmd using previous gaap through for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
under current gaap  the goodwill will not be amortized as an expense unless and until the value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the acquisitions reflected in goodwill continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business activities  representing of total sales in utmd does not expect its goodwill intangible assets to become impaired in the foreseeable future 
b liabilities 
excluding accrued and deferred income taxes  utmd s total liabilities at the end of and  which were  and  respectively  were both less than of total assets reduced by the total accrued tax liability 
at the end of  utmd s total debt ratio decreased to from at the end of the decline was due to accrued taxes on the extraordinary item on the balance sheet at the end of which were paid in results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales decreased in compared to foreign international sales increased while us domestic sales declined 
revenues were negatively affected by an august fda press release that announced that the fda filed a lawsuit against utmd 
international revenues continued to be negatively affected by the fda s refusal  continuing since  to provide certificates to foreign governments cfgs 
utmd divides its domestic sales into two primary distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct sales were of domestic sales in both and  and in the remaining sales were oem sales  eg of domestic sales in were domestic oem sales 
domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales in compared to in and in domestic direct sales which appeared least affected by the fda announcement were sales where clinicians make the purchase decision 
consequently  the least affected sales were sales to physician offices and clinics 
hospital labor and delivery l d department sales appeared to be the most affected 
hospital nicu sales were less affected than l d because practitioners still have major discretion in determining what products are purchased 
in order to help gain further attention of concerned hospital administrators  utmd instituted a special loyalty discount in late august 
ignoring the effect of the special us hospital customer loyalty discount the discount in effect from august through november   utmd s sales were down from the amount of the discount was international sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to and in years and  respectively 
of the international sales  were made in europe  compared to in both and ireland operations utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in compared to in and in utmd ltd 
shipments  including intercompany to midvale  were down in euro terms  and down in usd terms  compared to utmd groups sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies including providing vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components and molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and typically have differentiated product features protected by patents 
revenues by product category worldwide obstetrics product sales were  in compared to  in and  in without the discount  obstetrics sales were  of the decline in total obstetrics sales  was from lower sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads  an decline  and  from lower intran plus iupc sales  a decline 
abcorp sales of helped offset the declines 
after august  the lower iupc and vads sales resulted primarily from concerns of hospital administrators related to the press release from the fda 
other contributing factors included a trend in obstetrics practice that favors abdominal operative deliveries over vaginal operative deliveries because of medical malpractice litigation risk  and increased competition including effects of product bundling agreements 
cheaper priced  less clinically effective products represent significant competition where hospital administrators are constrained by gpo contracts or may not take the total cost of care into consideration  including increased risk of complications and utilization rates 
international obstetrics sales increased to in from in consolidated global gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales were  in compared to  in and  in without the discount  sales were  international sales in this category decreased 
international sales were negatively affected by not being able to supply requested fda cfgs to international distributors 
consolidated global neonatal product sales were  in compared to  in and  in without the discount  sales were  international neonatal product sales increased 
worldwide blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales were  in compared to  in and  in without the discount  sales were  international sales in this category  which includes plastic molded components increased 
looking forward to  utmd s improvement in sales depends primarily on the timing of a favorable resolution of the lawsuit with the fda  receipt of cfgs and restoration of its good reputation for supplying high quality devices 
if the fda lawsuit is resolved by the middle of the year  management believes that it can achieve a increase in sales relative to b gross profit 
utmd s average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus after costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products cogs are subtracted from net revenues  was compared to a company record in and in as a percentage of sales  the negative effect of the discount was more pronounced on gross profits than on sales 
in  utmd experienced higher materials costs  particularly for plastics  along with increased labor costs  lower absorption of fixed overhead costs because of lower sales  and an unfavorable shift from higher margin products to lower margin products 
the unfavorable cost trends were partially offset by lower depreciation expense on fixed assets and recoveries of previous years misappropriated funds 
with regard to the latter  utmd recognized a favorable contribution to gross profit of  and  for q and  respectively  as the result of recovery of misappropriated funds that had reduced gross profit performance in prior years 
the audit committee of utmd was fully involved in the investigation and resolution of this matter 
with respect to gross profits in utmd s sales channels  oem sales are sales of utmd components that are marketed by other companies as part of their product offerings 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overheads cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
utmd targets an average gpm greater than or equal to  which it believes is necessary to successfully support the significant operating expenses required in a highly complex and competitive medical device marketplace 
management expects to achieve this gpm target again in expected favorable influences include growth in sales volume without a similar increase in manufacturing overhead expenses  a larger percentage of total sales from higher margin products and a continued emphasis on reengineering products and processes to reduce costs 
expected unfavorable influences are continued increases in material costs  competitive pressure on pricing and higher wage rates 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  research and development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
operating expenses in were lower by than in however  because of lower gross profits  operating profit decreased to  compared to  in operating profits were  utmd s operating profit margin operating profits divided by total sales was in  compared to a record in and in operating expenses as a percentage of sales were in  compared to in both and looking forward to  utmd expects to continue to achieve an outstanding operating margin by maintaining its gpm above and controlling operating expenses below of sales 
the primary risk to achieving that expectation is a delay in the expected resolution of the lawsuit with the fda 
a further delay would be a double negative by continuing to retard sales activity while at the same time increasing litigation costs which are time related 
i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  processing orders and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly employed for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that provide coverage across the us year s m expenses decreased to  from  in and  in  as utmd continued to focus on the productivity of its direct sales force 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in looking forward  utmd plans higher s m expenses during due to group purchasing organization fees  increased advertising expenses and new marketing initiatives  but intends to manage s m expenses to remain less than of total sales 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
internal r d expenses were in  in and in as a percent of sales  and r d expenses were compared to in in addition to new products still being developed  a number of existing products were enhanced or updated in in  utmd will opportunistically employ r d resources to invest where management anticipates it can get a significant return with future new product sales 
r d expenses are again likely to be in the range of of sales 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  legal  risk management and protection of intellectual property 
in addition to employing the personnel required to coordinate or manage the preceding functions  g a expenses include outside director costs  outside legal counsel  independent accounting audit fees  k administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  business insurance costs and corporate contributions to charitable organizations 
g a expenses were  in   in and  in as a percent of sales  g a expenses were in  in and in all three years included litigation expenses relating to the patent infringement lawsuit with tyco kendalloltp or lawsuits with the fda 
in addition  all three years include increasing g a expenses to comply with required governance activities mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of it is management s objective to hold g a expenses to about of sales again in d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest expenses and bank fees 
non operating income was in  in and in the increase in resulted from investment income on much higher average cash and investment balances  higher rental income and no interest expense 
royalties received were in all three years 
future royalties may vary depending on the success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the applicable patents 
in  utmd had no interest expense because it did not utilize its bank line of credit 
in and  respectively  interest expense was and utmd expects non operating income in to be between and the actual amount received will depend on many factors including the timing of utilization of cash balances for share repurchases  dividends or acquisitions  the market performance of utmd s liquid investments  the need for capital to support litigation  and cash flow from normal operating performance 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt were  in   in and  in ebt in were lower than in  the same percentage decrease as sales 
given the projections previously noted  management is targeting ebt of about  e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
net income in decreased  consistent with the change in sales  to  from  in net income was  the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in tax on the extraordinary items was  resulting in a combined tax rate of 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from differences in distribution of state income taxes  variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  extraterritorial income exclusions  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects that utmd s consolidated income tax rate should be similar in compared to  but this is difficult to predict 
utmd s normal net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for years  and  respectively 
this profitability performance factor is the primary driver for utmd s return on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the current period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were  up from in in  eps were 
fewer outstanding shares accounted for the increase in eps 
utmd management believes shareholder value is improved by consistently increasing eps 
over the last seven years since  utmd has increased eps at an annually compounded rate of per year 
the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was in thousands shares compared to in and in the total number of options outstanding at year end was about the same in as  following a decline in the prior year 
dilution decreased in from because the average number of options outstanding decreased substantially  partially offset by a higher average share price in the stock market 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
because roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures  the calculations of roe which follow do not exclude the extraordinary items 
roe in was before dividends  compared to in and in this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support growth in revenues without issuing more stock 
the lower roe in  despite a continued excellent net profit margin  was due to payment of dividends to shareholders which reduced retained profits  much higher average cash and investment balances which reduced total asset turns  and no long term debt which reduced financial leverage compared to prior years 
looking forward  roe is projected to be lower than if cash and investment balances are maintained at current levels  shareholder dividends are continued and no other extraordinary income is received 
in utmd s opinion  achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholder value 
utmd s roe has averaged per year over the last years 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
cash and investment balances were  at the end of  compared to  at the end of net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in compared to  in and  in major changes in operating assets and liabilities in both and were related to the accrual and receipt of about million from tyco international for patent infringement  and taxes on that income 
cash provided by operating activities in includes continued excellent net income performance  aided by a tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee options  compared to the same tax benefit in of  and in the company s use of cash for investing activities was primarily as a result of purchases of short term investments  in an effort to make prudent use of excess cash 
utmd expended  in on such purchases  compared to in and none in in  utmd received  from selling short term investments 
utmd invested  in second quarter to acquire abcorp  inc  its vendor for fetal monitoring belts 
please see the table under supplemental disclosure of cash flow information for detail of the abcorp assets purchased 
in  utmd received  and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options 
employees and directors exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of the individuals trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options 
utmd paid to meet tax withholding requirements on options exercised 
utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon an employee trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price and related tax withholding requirements 
during  utmd did not utilize its bank line of credit 
in  utmd made repayments of  on its note payable  which eliminated the line of credit balance remaining at the end of  while receiving in proceeds from the line of credit 
in  utmd made loan repayments of  and received  in proceeds from the line of credit to finance the november tender offer for utmd share repurchases 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to capital expenditures  utmd plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock remains undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
the revolving line of credit will continue to be available for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time not otherwise available from existing cash and investment balances 
in summary  management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following to make investments in new technology  to acquire a product line that will help spur revenue growth and better utilize utmd s infrastructure  and or to buy back utmd shares in the open marketplace 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of utmd s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands less more contractual obligations and than than commitments total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations  purchase obligations   total   the majority of utmd s purchase obligations constitute raw materials for use in its manufacturing operations 
utmd has the right to make changes in  among other things  purchase quantities  delivery schedules and order acceptance 
off balance sheet arrangements utmd s only off balance sheet arrangements are an operating lease on its oregon manufacturing facility  and a lease for a portion of the parking lot adjacent to its utah manufacturing facility 
details on those arrangements are provided above  and in note on page f other financial measures ebitda equals ebt  plus depreciation and amortization expenses  plus interest expense is a term used for measuring a company s ability to generate cash from its operations without regard for changes in working capital  cash consumed for fixed asset purchases  its cost of borrowing or income tax burden 
utmd s ebitda from normal operations in was million  or as a ratio of sales 
in both and  ebitda was of sales 
the strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of excellent profitability together with royalty income from others use of utmd s technology 
utmd s ebitda including extraordinary items was million 
with sales and other performance factors as projected above  management expects ebitda from normal operations to be about million 
please note that ebitda is not defined or described by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as such  it is not prepared in accordance with gaap  is not a measure of liquidity  and is not a measure of operating results 
however  the components of ebitda are prepared in accordance with gaap  and utmd believes that ebitda is an important measure of the company s operating performance and financial well being 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to clear up its unresolved qsr status with the us fda that has hindered international sales  slowed new product development  stymied business development and consumed an inordinate amount of human capital since  continue outstanding operating performance  actively look for new acquisitions to facilitate sales growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
our passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus and does not seek to become big as a primary motivation 
we just want to do an excellent job in meeting our customers needs and provide our shareholders with excellent returns 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represents significant clinical benefits as well as minimal total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product  without understanding the total cost of care picture 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd s eps were up  and its ending share price was down relative to the end of in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia were up   and  respectively  in looking back five years to the end of  utmd s eps have more than doubled  and its year ending share price has more than tripled 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia were down  down and down  respectively  over that same five year time span 
in  utmd again demonstrated a high positive cash flow  managing working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures below its rate of depreciation of existing assets 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to finance an acquisition in without issuing stock 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies that will enhance its specialist focus 
when utmd acquires a company  it probably will be for cash and with the idea that it will be able to retain key resources that helped make the acquired entity successful 
accounting policy changes 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this revised statement establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services  including the grant of stock options to employees and directors 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after june   and will require the company to recognize compensation cost based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments it awards 
the company currently accounts for those instruments under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion  including the disclosure only provisions of the original sfas accordingly  no compensation cost from issuing equity instruments has been recognized in the company s financial statements 
the company estimates that the required adoption of sfas r in third quarter will have a negative impact on its consolidated financial statements 
please see note  starting on page f for an estimate of the impact this statement would have had on the company s net income for the periods covered by this report
