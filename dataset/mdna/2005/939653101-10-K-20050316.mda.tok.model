risk factors set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our shareholders 
we refer to the shares of beneficial interest in washington real estate investment trust as our shares  and the investors who own shares as our shareholders 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements beginning on page our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets are subject to the risk that if our office  industrial  multifamily and retail properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
the following factors  among others  may adversely affect the revenues generated by our office  industrial  multifamily and retail properties downturns in the national  regional and local economic climate  competition from other office  industrial  multifamily and retail properties  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office  industrial  multi family or retail properties  changes in interest rates and availability of financing  vacancies  changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair  renovate and relet space  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  civil disturbances  earthquakes and other natural disasters  terrorist acts or acts of war may result in uninsured or underinsured losses  significant expenditures associated with each investment  such as debt service payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property  ability to collect rents from tenants  and increased public company costs due to federal and or state legislation 
we are dependent upon the economic climate of the greater washington baltimore region 
all of our properties are located in the greater washington baltimore region 
general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in this geographic region have a particularly strong effect on us 
we face risks associated with property acquisitions 
we intend to continue to acquire properties which would continue to increase our size and could alter our capital structure 
our acquisition activities and success may be exposed to the following risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors  including publicly traded real estate investment trusts  institutional investment funds and private investors  even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property  it is subject to customary conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigations which may be unacceptable  competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price  we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms  acquired properties may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investments  and our estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without recourse  or with limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if liability were asserted against us based upon the acquisition of a property  we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
we face new and different risks associated with property development 
the ground up development of rosslyn towers and south washington street  as opposed to renovation and redevelopment of an existing property  is a new activity for writ 
developing properties  in addition to the risks historically associated with our business  presents a number of new and additional risks for us  including risks that the development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources  if we are unable to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations  the development and construction costs of the project may exceed original estimates  construction and or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all  the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  such as weather  labor conditions and material shortages  which would result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses  and occupancy rates and rents at the newly completed property may not meet the expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable 
properties developed or acquired for development may generate little or no cash flow from the date of acquisition through the date of completion of development 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  may require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
we face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re leasing space 
from through  leases on our office  retail and industrial properties will expire on a total of approximately of our leased square footage as of december   with leases on approximately of our leased square footage expiring in  in  in  in and in we derive substantially all of our income from rent received from tenants 
if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress  it may be unable to make timely rental payments 
also  when our tenants decide not to renew their leases  we may not be able to relet the space 
if tenants decide to renew their leases  the terms of renewals  including the cost of required improvements or concessions  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
as a result  our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less 
for the years ended and  the residential tenant retention rate was and  respectively 
we face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by a property 
although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies in the past  a major tenant could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future 
we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy 
on the other hand  a court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us 
in such case  our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid  future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease  and  even so  our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full 
this shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results from operations 
our properties face significant competition 
we face significant competition from developers  owners and operators of office  industrial  multifamily  retail and other commercial real estate 
substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market 
such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge 
these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties  which may result in their owners being willing to make space available at lower prices than the space in our properties 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other laws could result in substantial costs 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings  including office  industrial  retail and multifamily properties  be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants 
if  pursuant to the americans with disabilities act  we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties  including the removal of access barriers  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
we may also incur significant costs complying with other regulations 
our properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we may incur fines or private damage awards 
we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements 
however  we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely affect our cash flow and results from operations 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties 
we believe all of our properties are adequately insured 
the property insurance that we maintain for our properties has historically been on an all risk basis  which is in full force and effect until renewal in september effective september  we have a separate insurance policy covering losses caused by acts of terrorism  also in full force and effect until renewal in september there are other types of losses  such as from wars or catastrophic acts of nature  for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost 
in the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance limits  we could lose both the revenues generated from the affected property and the capital we have invested in the affected property 
depending on the specific circumstances of the affected property it is possible that we could be liable for any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss could adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations 
also  we have to renew our policies in most cases on an annual basis and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage  exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets  including the possibility of rate increases 
any material increase in insurance rates or decrease in available coverage in the future could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties  regardless of our knowledge or responsibility  simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency and the us occupational safety and health administration are increasingly involved in indoor air quality standards  especially with respect to asbestos  mold and medical waste 
the clean up of any environmental contamination  including asbestos and mold  can be costly 
if unidentified environmental problems arise  we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our cash flow  because as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination  the law typically imposes clean up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination  each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs  and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs 
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
in addition  applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination 
we have a storage tank third party liability  corrective action and clean up policy in place to cover potential hazardous releases from underground storage tanks on our properties 
this insurance is in place to mitigate any potential remediation costs from the effect of releases of hazardous or toxic substances from these storage tanks 
additional coverage is in place under a pollution legal liability real estate policy 
this would  dependent on circumstance and type of pollutants discovered  provide further coverage above and beyond the storage tank policy 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos  and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties 
these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas  an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state  federal and historical documents  but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling 
where appropriate  on a property by property basis  our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing  including sampling for asbestos  for mold  for lead in drinking water  for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usages create a potential environmental problem  and for contamination in groundwater 
even though these environmental assessments are conducted  there is still the risk that the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted  and future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability to us 
we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments  including refinancing risk 
we rely on borrowings under our credit facilities to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital 
if we were unable to borrow under our credit facilities  or to refinance existing indebtedness  our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
we anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due 
rising interest rates would increase our interest costs 
we may incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  if interest rates increase  so will our interest costs  which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service debt 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
these agreements  however  increase our risks including other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements may be unenforceable 
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition 
our credit facilities contain customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness 
we must maintain certain ratios  including total debt to assets  secured debt to total assets  debt service coverage and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt 
our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants 
failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured credit facilities or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments 
this could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial condition and liquidity 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current shareholders 
the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments and acquisitions instead of incurring additional debt 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing 
failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation  which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we would be taxed as a corporation 
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and could be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions  we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we are disqualified  and all dividends would be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits potentially eligible as qualified dividends subject to the income tax rate 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would no longer be required to pay dividends 
as a result of these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and could adversely affect the value of our shares 
the market value of our securities can be adversely affected by many factors 
as with any public company  a number of factors may adversely influence the public market price of our common shares  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include level of institutional interest in us  perception of reits generally and reits with portfolios similar to ours  in particular  by market professionals  attractiveness of securities of reits in comparison to other companies taking into account  among other things  that a substantial portion of reits dividends are taxed as ordinary income  our financial condition and performance  the market s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends  government action or regulation  including changes in tax law  increases in market interest rates  which may lead investors to expect a higher annual yield from our distributions in relation to the price of our shares  and relatively low trading volume of shares of reits in general  which tends to exacerbate a market trend with respect to our stock 
additional risk factors are discussed in the forward looking statements section beginning on page item properties the schedule on the following pages lists our real estate investment portfolio as of december   which consisted of properties  including three properties held for sale

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to estimated useful lives of real estate assets  cost reimbursement income  bad debts  contingencies and litigation 
we base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
overview our revenues are derived primarily from the ownership and operation of income producing real properties in the greater washington baltimore region 
as of december   we owned a diversified portfolio of properties  consisting of office buildings  retail centers  multifamily buildings and industrial complexes totaling million net rentable square feet 
we have a fundamental strategy of regional focus  diversification by property type and conservative capital management 
when evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  management focuses on the following financial and non financial indicators  discussed in further detail herein net operating income noi by segment 
noi is calculated as real estate rental revenue less real estate operating expenses 
it is a supplemental measure to net income 
economic occupancy or occupancy defined as actual rental revenues recognized for the period indicated as a percentage of gross potential rental revenues for that period  leased percentage the percentage of available physical net rentable area leased for our commercial segments and percentage of apartment units leased for our residential segment and rental rates 
leasing activity new leases  renewals and expirations 
funds from operations ffo  a supplemental measure to net income 
during we continued our long standing strategy of focusing in the greater washington baltimore region  one of the most stable real estate markets in the country 
the region posted positive job growth of approximately in the twelve months ended october  compared to nationally 
the job growth occurred principally in the professional business services  retail and construction sectors  while only the manufacturing and transportation utility sectors lost jobs 
this is a positive sign for continued economic growth in the region 
overall conditions in the region improved during the year  with continued strength in the retail sector and stabilizing rents in the office and industrial sectors  while the multifamily sector continued to be affected by the combination of overbuilding and a slow economic recovery 
overall occupancies as well as our results in were primarily impacted by the million in acquisitions we completed in and  while the performance of our core portfolio consisting of properties owned for the entirety of and the same time period in was slightly down compared to the performance of our four operating segments generally reflected market conditions in our region 
the regional office market  particularly northern virginia  improved during the year due primarily to job growth in the federal government and among related contractors 
while leasing activity increased  rental rates generally remained steady due to significant amounts of remaining vacant space 
these conditions were reflected in our northern virginia office portfolio  which was leased at year end due to vacancies at our tysons corner  virginia properties 
three of our four tysons corner properties were classified as held for sale at december  leesburg  tycon plaza ii and tycon plaza iii 
excluding these properties  our northern virginia office portfolio was leased  compared to in our washington  dc portfolio 
the washington  dc office market led the region in overall occupancy and development activity and experienced moderate rental rate growth due to strong market conditions 
overall leasing activity in the suburban maryland market improved  however rental rates were generally flat to down depending on the submarket  as the pace of economic recovery was slower than anticipated and national institutes of health and its subcontractors showed little demand 
our maryland office portfolio was leased at year end due to large vacancies at our maryland trade center properties excluding these properties  the leased percentage in our maryland portfolio was 
the retail market remained strong in the region due to continued job growth spurring high occupancies and strong sales  as was reflected in our retail portfolio which was leased at year end 
the multifamily market in the washington  dc and northern virginia regions improved due to condominium conversions and job growth  while suburban maryland was negatively affected by excess supply and a slower pace of job growth and condominium conversions 
similarly  occupancies at our maryland multifamily properties generally declined in compared to  while occupancies at our washington  dc and virginia properties generally improved  particularly at the ashby at mclean  where of units previously off the market for renovation were rented as of december  the industrial market benefited from the region s strengthening economy during the year  particularly in the baltimore washington and dulles corridors  with positive absorption and increased rents 
our industrial portfolio was leased at year end compared to at december  during we completed the redevelopment of westminster shopping center  where a regional grocery store chain took possession of a  square foot space in november  and continued development of rosslyn towers  our mixed use residential and retail community in virginia 
we are in the planning stage of development at south washington street and redevelopment at foxchase shopping center  both in alexandria  virginia 
significant transactions during the two years ended december  are summarized below the acquisitions of two industrial properties for an aggregate purchase price of million  adding approximately  square feet of industrial rental space  and two office properties for an aggregate price of million  adding approximately  square feet of office rental space 
the disposition of boone boulevard  a  square foot office property  for million see discontinued operations discussion on page the execution of new leases for  square feet of office  retail  and industrial space combined 
the execution of a new million line of credit with bank one  na and wells fargo bank  national association that replaced the previous million facility with bank one  na

critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
revenue recognition residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less  and commercial properties are leased under operating leases with average terms of three to seven years 
we recognize rental income and rental abatements from our residential and commercial leases when earned on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases 
we record a provision for losses on accounts receivable equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
this estimate is based on our historical experience and a review of the current status of the company s receivables 
percentage rents  which represent additional rents based on gross tenant sales  are recognized when tenants sales exceed specified thresholds 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained  possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and we have no significant continuing involvement 
we recognize cost reimbursement income from pass through expenses on an accrual basis over the periods in which the expenses were incurred 
pass through expenses are comprised of real estate taxes  operating expenses and common area maintenance costs which are reimbursed by tenants in accordance with specific allowable costs per tenant lease agreements 
capital expenditures we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets  significantly increasing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset 
expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
real estate assets real estate assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
all capital improvement expenditures associated with replacements  improvements  or major repairs to real property are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
all tenant improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the lease 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to the related physical assets and in place leases based on their fair values  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the fair values of acquired buildings are determined on an as if vacant basis considering a variety of factors  including the physical condition and quality of the buildings  estimated rental and absorption rates  estimated future cash flows and valuation assumptions consistent with current market conditions 
the as if vacant fair value is allocated to land  building and tenant improvements based on property tax assessments and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the fair value of in place leases consists of the following components the estimated cost to us to replace the leases  including foregone rents during the period of finding a new tenant  foregone recovery of tenant pass throughs  tenant improvements  and other direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant referred to as tenant origination cost  the estimated leasing commissions associated with obtaining a new tenant referred to as leasing commissions  the above at below market cash flow of the leases  determined by comparing the projected cash flows of the leases in place to projected cash flows of comparable market rate leases referred to as net lease intangible  and the value  if any  of customer relationships  determined based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant referred to as customer relationship value 
the amounts used to calculate tenant origination cost  leasing commissions and net lease intangible are discounted using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
tenant origination costs are included in real estate assets on our balance sheet and are amortized as depreciation expense on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the underlying leases 
the remaining components  leasing commissions and net lease intangible  are included in other assets and other liabilities on our balance sheet 
we have attributed no value to customer relationship value at december  or december  discontinued operations we dispose of assets sometimes using tax deferred exchanges that are inconsistent with our long term strategic or return objectives or where market conditions for sale are favorable 
the proceeds from the sales are reinvested into other properties  used to fund development operations or to support other corporate needs  or are distributed to our shareholders 
we classify properties as held for sale when they meet the necessary criteria specified by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
these include senior management commits to and actively embarks upon a plan to sell the assets  the sale is expected to be completed within one year under terms usual and customary for such sales and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
depreciation on these properties is discontinued  but operating revenues  operating expenses and interest expense continue to be recognized until the date of sale 
under sfas  revenues and expenses of properties that are either sold or classified as held for sale are treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the statements of income 
impairment losses on long lived assets we recognize impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such carrying amount is in excess of the estimated cash flows from the operation and disposal of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to the estimated fair market value 
there were no property impairments recognized during the three year period ended december  federal income taxes we have qualified as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code and intend to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain our status as a reit  we are required to distribute of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders 
we have the option of i reinvesting the sale price of properties sold  allowing for a deferral of income taxes on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the shareholders with no tax to the company or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the shareholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the shareholders 
we distributed of our  and ordinary taxable income to our shareholders 
gains on sale of properties disposed during and were either distributed to the shareholders or reinvested in replacement properties  respectively 
no provision for income taxes was necessary during the three year period ending december  results of operations the discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and the ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed and dispositions made during those years 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  we categorize our properties as either core  non core or discontinued operations 
a core property is one that was owned for the entirety of the periods being evaluated and is included in continuing operations 
a non core property is one that was acquired during either of the periods being evaluated and is included in continuing operations 
results for properties sold or held for sale during any of the periods evaluated are classified as discontinued operations 
to provide more insight into our operating results  our discussion is divided into two main sections consolidated results of operations where we provide an overview analysis of results on a consolidated basis and net operating income noi where we provide a detailed analysis of core versus non core property level noi results by segment 
noi is calculated as real estate rental revenue less real estate operating expenses 
consolidated results of operations real estate rental revenue real estate rental revenue is summarized as follows all data in thousands except percentage amounts vs change vs change minimum base rent recoveries from tenants parking and other tenant charges real estate rental revenue is comprised of minimum base rent  which includes rental revenues recognized on a straight line basis  revenue from the recovery of operating expenses from our tenants and other revenue such as parking and termination fees

interest expense overall  our cost of funds has decreased between and due to the refinancing of notes payable 
the increase in interest expense during this timeframe is the result of acquisition and development activity funded in part through the issuance of debt

the million increase in general and administrative expense in from was primarily attributable to increased short term cash and long term equity incentive compensation 
discontinued operations we dispose of assets sometimes using tax deferred exchanges that are inconsistent with our long term strategic or return objectives or where market conditions for sale are favorable 
the proceeds from the sales are reinvested into other properties  used to fund development operations or to support other corporate needs  or distributed to our shareholders 
on november   we sold boone boulevard for a sale price of million 
a portion of the proceeds was in the form of a subordinated million note receivable from the seller  which matures in november we recognized a gain on disposal of million and offset the million note from the buyer with a deferred gain liability in the same amount  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
sfas limits gain recognition when the seller s note is subject to future subordination to the amount by which the buyer s cash payments at settlement exceed the seller s cost of the property sold 
the deferred gain will be recognized as we receive payments on the note  which is payable in full upon maturity  or sooner as the buyer closes on the sale of converted office condominium units 
also in november we concluded that leesburg  tycon plaza ii  tycon plaza iii and certain development rights and approvals related to tycon plaza iii met the criteria specified by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas necessary to classify these properties as held for sale 
senior management had committed to  and actively embarked upon  a plan to sell the assets and the sale was expected to be completed within one year under terms usual and customary for such sales  with no indication that the plan would be significantly altered or abandoned 
depreciation on these properties was discontinued at that time  but operating revenues and other operating expenses continued to be recognized until the date of sale 
under sfas revenues and expenses of properties that are classified as held for sale or sold are treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the statements of income 
these properties  totaling approximately  square feet  were sold on february  for a sale price of million with an estimated gain on sale of million 
gain on disposal of real estate from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   resulting from the february sale of south capitol street 
operating results of the properties classified as discontinued operations are summarized as follows in thousands revenues property expenses depreciation and amortization net operations of properties sold or held for sale decreased million for compared to and million for compared to both decreases were due primarily to lower revenue at leesburg  tycon plaza ii and tycon plaza iii due to increased vacancies 
net operating income real estate net operating income noi  defined as real estate rental revenue less real estate operating expenses  is the primary performance measure we use to assess the results of our operations at the property level 
we provide noi as a supplement to net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
noi does not represent net income calculated in accordance with gaap 
as such  it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
noi is calculated as net income  less non real estate other revenue and the results of discontinued operations including the gain on sale  if any  plus interest expense  depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses

liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of liquidity are our real estate operations and our unsecured credit facilities  in addition to the capital markets 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available for borrowing under our unsecured credit facilities 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under leases at our properties 
our operating cash flow therefore depends materially on our ability to lease our properties to tenants  the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
our primary uses of cash are to fund distributions to shareholders  to fund capital investments in our existing portfolio of operating assets  to fund new acquisitions  redevelopment and ground up development activities and to fund operating and administrative expenses 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our shareholders on an annual basis 
we also regularly require capital to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets in connection with large scale renovations  routine capital improvements  deferred maintenance on properties we have recently acquired  and our leasing activities  including funding tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions 
the amounts of the leasing related expenditures can vary significantly depending on negotiations with tenants and the current competitive leasing environment 
during  we expect that we will have significant capital requirements  including the following items 
there can be no assurance that our capital requirements will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations 
funding dividends on our common shares and minority interest distributions to third party unit holders  approximately million to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets  including approximately million to fund tenant related capital requirements and leasing commissions  approximately million to invest in our development projects  approximately million to fund our expected property acquisitions  we expect to meet our capital requirements using cash generated by our real estate operations  borrowings on our unsecured credit facilities  additional debt or equity capital raised in the public market  possible asset dispositions or funding acquisitions of properties through property specific mortgage debt 
we believe that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations and have access to the capital resources necessary to fund our requirements 
however  as a result of general  greater washington baltimore regional  or tenant economic downturns  unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our stock price  unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties  or our properties not performing as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the dividend required to maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
if principal amounts due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow may be insufficient to repay all maturing debt 
prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing such as possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans may result in higher interest rates and increased interest expense 
capital structure we manage our capital structure to reflect a long term investment approach  generally seeking to match the cash flow of our assets with a mix of equity and various debt instruments 
we expect that our capital structure will allow us to obtain additional capital from diverse sources that could include additional equity offerings of common shares  public and private debt financings and possible asset dispositions 
our ability to raise funds through the sale of debt and equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  our operating performance  our debt rating and the current trading price of our shares 
we will always analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  however the capital markets may not consistently be available on terms that are attractive 
in march and december  respectively  we issued million of and million of  unsecured notes 
also in december  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
during  we issued no notes or equity securities 
in april  we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission sec  which allows us to offer from time to time common shares  warrants to purchase common shares and unsecured senior or subordinated debt securities up to an aggregate amount of approximately million 
debt financing we generally use unsecured  corporate level debt  including unsecured notes and our unsecured credit facilities  to meet our borrowing needs 
long term  we generally use fixed rate debt instruments in order to match the returns from our real estate assets 
we also utilize variable rate debt for short term financing purposes 
at times  our mix of variable and fixed rate debt may not suit our needs 
at those times  we may use derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps  forward interest rate options or interest rate options in order to assist us in managing our debt mix 
we would either hedge our variable rate debt to give it a fixed interest rate or hedge fixed rate debt to give it a variable interest rate 
at december   there were no derivative securities outstanding 
typically we have obtained the ratings of two credit rating agencies in the underwriting of our unsecured debt 
as of december   standard poors had assigned its a rating  and moody s investor service has assigned its baa rating  to our unsecured debt offerings 
a downgrade in rating by either of these rating agencies could result from  among other things  a change in our financial position  or a downturn in general economic conditions 
any such downgrade could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or could increase the interest rates on our existing variable rate debt 
however  we have no debt instruments under which the principal maturity would be accelerated upon a downward change in our debt rating 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
our total debt at december  is summarized as follows in thousands fixed rate mortgages unsecured credit facilities senior unsecured notes the million in fixed rate mortgages  which includes million in unamortized premiums due to fair value adjustments  bore an effective weighted average interest rate of at december  and had a weighted average maturity of years 
our primary external source of liquidity is our two revolving credit facilities 
we can borrow up to million under these lines  which bear interest at an adjustable spread over libor based on our public debt rating 
credit facility no 
is a three year  million unsecured credit facility expiring in july credit facility no 
is a three year million unsecured credit facility expiring in july in march  we borrowed million under credit facility no 
to fund the acquisition of gorman road  an additional million in august to fund the acquisition of shady grove medical village ii  million in october to fund the acquisition of arlington boulevard  million in november to pay down a portion of the million of unsecured notes due  plus accrued interest  million in november and december to fund the acquisition of dulles business park  and million to fund certain capital improvements to real estate 
the million borrowed to fund the shady grove medical village ii acquisition was subsequently repaid in november 
we borrowed million in november under credit facility no 
to pay down the remaining portion of the million notes due 
in february we repaid million under credit facility no 
using a portion of the million proceeds from the disposition of leesburg  tycon plaza ii and tycon plaza iii 
our unsecured credit facilities contain financial and other covenants with which we must comply 
some of these covenants include a minimum ratio of annual ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense  a minimum ratio of tangible fair market value of our unencumbered assets to aggregate unsecured debt  and a maximum ratio of total debt to tangible fair market value of our assets 
failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured credit facilities or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments 
this could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial condition and liquidity 
as of december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants  however  our ability to draw on our unsecured credit facility or incur other unsecured debt in the future could be restricted by the loan covenants 
we anticipate that over the near term  interest rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on earnings 
our unsecured fixed rate notes payable have maturities ranging from august through february see note  as follows in thousands in thousands december  note principal notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due in march  we issued million of unsecured notes 
in august  we repaid million of unsecured notes 
no notes were issued in as noted above  we repaid million of unsecured notes in november utilizing credit facility borrowings 
our unsecured notes contain covenants with which we must comply 
these include limits on our total indebtedness  limits on our secured indebtedness  limits on our required debt service payments  and maintenance of a minimum level of unencumbered assets 
we are in compliance with our unsecured notes covenants as of december  dividends we pay dividends quarterly 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the board of trustees  the ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to shareholders 
the table below details our dividend and distribution payments for  and in thousands common dividends minority interest distributions dividends paid for as compared to increased as a direct result of a dividend rate increase from per share in to per share in and the issuance of million shares in december dividends paid in increased as compared to due to the dividend rate increase to per share from per share and the aforementioned share issuance 
cash flows from operations is an important factor in our ability to sustain our dividend at its current rate 
cash flows from operations increased from million in to million in due in part to acquisitions completed in if our cash flows from operations were to decline significantly  we may be unable to sustain our dividend payment at its current rate 
capital commitments we will require capital for development and redevelopment projects currently underway and in the future 
as of december   we had a mixed use residential and retail project with apartment units and  square feet of retail space rosslyn towers and a mixed use project with residential units and  square feet of retail space south washington street under development 
our total investment in rosslyn towers is expected to be million and in august  we executed a construction contract worth approximately million

the in average tenant improvement costs per square foot of space leased for office buildings in was primarily due to a lease executed at westpark in  allowing for million in tenant improvements for a large tenant 
the retail and industrial tenant improvement costs are substantially lower than office improvement costs due to the tenant improvements required in these property types being substantially less extensive than in office 
excluding properties sold or classified as held for sale  approximately of our office tenants renewed their leases with us in  compared to in and in renewing tenants generally require minimal tenant improvements 
in addition  lower tenant improvement costs are one of the many benefits of our focus on leasing to smaller office tenants 
smaller office suites have limited configuration alternatives 
therefore  we are often able to lease an existing suite with limited tenant improvements

ratios of earnings to fixed charges and debt service coverage the following table sets forth our ratios of earnings to fixed charges and debt service coverage for the periods shown year ended december  earnings to fixed charges x x x debt service coverage x x x we computed the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing earnings by fixed charges 
for this purpose  earnings consist of income from continuing operations plus fixed charges  less capitalized interest 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  including amortized costs of debt issuance  plus interest costs capitalized 
we computed the debt service coverage ratio by dividing ebitda which is earnings before interest income and expense  depreciation  amortization and gain on sale of real estate by interest expense and principal amortization 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used measure of operating performance for real estate companies 
we provide ffo as a supplemental measure to net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
although ffo is a widely used measure of operating performance for reits  ffo does not represent net income calculated in accordance with gaap 
as such  it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
in addition  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit defines ffo april  white paper as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property plus real estate depreciation and amortization 
we consider ffo to be a standard supplemental measure for reits because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which historically assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we believe that ffo more accurately provides investors an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and fund other needs 
our ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
these other reits may not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently 
the following table provides the calculation of our ffo and a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years presented in thousands net income adjustments depreciation and amortization gain on property disposed discontinued operations depreciation and amortization ffo as defined by nareit item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the principal material financial market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to refinancing long term fixed rate obligations  the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and our variable rate lines of credit 
we primarily enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including acquisition of real estate properties  capital improvements and working capital needs 
in the past we have used interest rate hedge agreements to hedge against rising interest rates in anticipation of imminent refinancing or new debt issuance
