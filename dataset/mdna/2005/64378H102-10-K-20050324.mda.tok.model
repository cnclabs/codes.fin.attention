we have five manufacturing plants in the prc with an aggregate production capacity of approximately  tons of flour and approximately billion packets of instant noodles 
operation plan our current strategies are o to expand our customer base and production lines and o to acquire additional plants with regional brand recognition to increase our market share in china 
plans for expansion of the existing plants are expected to be funded through current working capital from ongoing sales 
a significant acquisition will require additional funds in the form of debt or equity  or a combination of both 
however  there can be no assurance these funds will be available 
significant establishment  acquisition and disposal the longyuan plant in march  we established the longyuan plant together with a third party in order to support our growth in the flour and instant noodles businesses and to add additional revenue streams 
the longyuan plant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of packing material 
we own of the equity of the longyuan plant the dalian plant the dalian plant was established ten years ago and its facilities needed to be overhauled completely in order to meet prc environmental requirements 
in consideration of the costs that would be incurred and the past performance of the operation  management decided to temporarily cease its operations in december in view of the fact that the local market can be satisfied by the yantai plant 
in may  a sale agreement was signed with an independent buyer where the buyer acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the dalian plant 
the loans made by the owners were not assumed in the transaction and remain as liabilities of the company 
accordingly  the company has recorded a gain on disposal of approximately us  of the loans in the second quarter of on december   the company sold its equity interest in the dalian company together with its holding company  noble point limited  to its parent company and assumed the outstanding loan due to the parent company  at a consideration of us  which approximates the net asset value in aggregate after the assignment of the loan

there was a substantial increase in the gross profit margin as the gross profit for the fourth quarter of increased by million over the same period for the prior year 
the increase is mainly due to the result of a change in product sales mix and an increase in demand for our products at the end of the third and fourth quarter of the company exported over  packets of noodles to korea during which accounted for of our instant noodle sales 
we have also commenced selling our products to supermarkets located in urban areas

selling and distribution expenses increased from million for the fiscal year ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended december  due to increased transportation costs associated with more stringent weight load restrictions

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates the estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that the company s estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
contractual joint ventures a contractual joint venture is an entity established between the company and another joint venture partner  with the rights and obligations of each party governed by a contract 
if the company owns more than of the joint venture and is able to govern and control its financial and operating policies and its board of directors  such joint venture is considered as a de facto subsidiary and is accounted for as a subsidiary 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sales represent the invoiced value of goods  net of value added tax vat  supplied to customers  and are recognized upon delivery of goods and passage of title 
all of the company s sales made in mainland china are subject to mainland chinese value added tax at rates ranging from to output vat 
such output vat is payable after offsetting vat paid by the company on purchases input vat 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a weighted average basis  and net realizable value 
costs of work in progress and finished goods are composed of direct material  direct labor and an attributable portion of manufacturing overhead

in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin r  a revision to fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r clarifies some of the provisions of fin and exempts certain entities from its requirements 
fin r is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after march  entities that have adopted fin prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of fin until the effective date of fin r 
the adoption of fin r did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no

will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
risks factors related to our business in addition to the other information in this annual report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business and prospects 
the following matters  among others  may have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations or prospects  financial or otherwise  of the company 
reference to this cautionary statement in the context of a forward looking statement or statements shall be deemed to be a statement that any one or more of the following factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward looking statement or statements 
we are subject to  among others  the following risks risks associated with our business 
our business may result in adverse effects from competition in the noodle and flour product markets 
the noodle and flour product markets are highly competitive 
competition in these markets takes many forms  including the following o establishing favorable brand recognition  o developing products sought by consumers  o implementing appropriate pricing  o providing strong marketing support  and o obtaining access to retain outlets and sufficient shelf space 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources  including our primary competitors  master kang and president 
we may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause us to lose our market share  increase expenditures or reduce pricing  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
an inability to respond quickly and effectively to new trends would adversely impact our competitive position 
our failure to maintain the superiority of our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could adversely affect our ability to retain existing business and secure new business 
we will need to constantly seek out new products and develop new solutions to maintain in our portfolio 
if we are unable to keep current with new trends  our competitors technologies or products may render us noncompetitive and our products obsolete 
increases in prices of main ingredients and other materials could adversely affect our business 
the main ingredients that we use to manufacture our products are flour and eggs 
we also use paper products  such as corrugated cardboard  as well as films and plastics  to package our products 
the prices of these materials have been  and we expect them to continue to be  subject to volatility 
we may not be able to pass price increases in these materials onto our customers which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we are subject to risks associated with joint ventures and third party agreements 
we conduct our milling and sales operations through joint ventures established with certain chinese parties 
any deterioration of these strategic relationships may have an adverse effect on our operation 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretation  or the imposition of confiscatory taxation  restrictions on currency conversion  imports and sources of supply  devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
under its current leadership  the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization 
there is no assurance  however  that the chinese government will continue to pursue these policies  or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice 
we may have limited legal recourse under chinese law if disputes arise under our agreements with joint ventures or third parties 
the chinese government has enacted some laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance  foreign investment  commerce  taxation and trade 
however  their experience in implementing  interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is limited  and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable 
if our new business ventures are unsuccessful  or other adverse circumstances arise from these transactions  we face the risk that the parties to these ventures may seek ways to terminate the transactions  or  may hinder or prevent us from accessing important information regarding the financial and business operations of these acquired companies 
the resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the chinese government  and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination 
any rights we may have to specific performance  or to seek an injunction under chinese law  in either of these cases  are severely limited  and without a means of recourse by virtue of the chinese legal system  we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring 
the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls  which could negatively impact its profitability 
we sell food products for human consumption  which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage  product tampering and other adulteration of food products 
we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury  illness or death 
in addition  we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage 
a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our profitability for a period of time depending on product availability  competitive reaction and consumer attitudes 
even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued  the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image 
we have limited business insurance coverage 
the insurance industry in china is still in its early stage of development 
insurance companies in china offer limited business insurance 
as a result  we do not have any business liability insurance coverage for our operations 
moreover  while business disruption insurance is available  we have determined that the risks of disruption and cost of the insurance are such that we do not require it at this time 
any business disruption  litigation or natural disaster might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
we have a limited concentration of credit risk 
concentration of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base  and their dispersion across the prc 
in addition  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of each customer s financial condition and maintains reserves for potential credit losses 
such losses in the aggregate have not exceeded management s expectations 
we may experience risks resulting from our plans for expansion 
we have acquired several companies and businesses and may continue to acquire companies in the future 
entering into an acquisition entails many risks  any of which could harm our business  including a diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  b failure to integrate the acquired company with our existing business  c additional operating expenses not offset by additional revenue  and d dilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities 
if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy  we may be less successful in the future 
a key component of our growth strategy is accomplished by acquiring additional flour and noodle factories 
while there are many such companies  we may not always be able to identify and acquire companies meeting our acquisition criteria on terms acceptable to us 
additionally  financing to complete significant acquisitions may not always be available on satisfactory terms 
further  our acquisition strategy presents a number of special risks to us that it would not otherwise contend with absent such strategy  including possible adverse effects on our earnings after each acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business due to the special attention that a particular acquisition may require  failure to retain key acquired personnel and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities arising after each acquisition  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with doing business in the people s republic of china 
we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in the people s republic of china 
as most of our operations are conducted in the prc  the company is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies operating in north america and western europe 
these include risks associated with  among others  the political  economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in the prc  and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations  anti inflationary measures  currency conversion and remittance abroad  and rates and methods of taxation  among other things 
although the majority of productive assets in china are owned by the chinese government  in the past several years the government has implemented economic reform measures that emphasize decentralization and encourage private economic activity 
because these economic reform measures may be inconsistent or ineffectual  there are no assurances that we will be able to capitalize on economic reforms  the chinese government will continue its pursuit of economic reform policies  the economic policies  even if pursued  will be successful  economic policies will not be significantly altered from time to time  and business operations in china will not become subject to the risk of nationalization 
economic reform policies or nationalization could result in a total investment loss in our common stock 
since  the chinese government has reformed its economic systems 
because many reforms are unprecedented or experimental  they are expected to be refined and improved 
other political  economic and social factors  such as political changes  changes in the rates of economic growth  unemployment or inflation  or in the disparities in per capita wealth between regions within china  could lead to further readjustment of the reform measures 
this refining and readjustment process may negatively affect our operations 
over the last few years  china s economy has registered a high growth rate 
recently  there have been indications that rates of inflation have increased 
in response  the chinese government has taken measures to curb this excessively expansive economy 
these measures include restrictions on the availability of domestic credit  reducing the purchasing capability of certain of its customers  and limited re centralization of the approval process for purchases of some foreign products 
the chinese government may adopt additional measures to further combat inflation  including the establishment of freezes or restraints on certain projects or markets 
these measures may adversely affect our manufacturing operations 
to date  reforms to china s economic system have not adversely impacted our operations and are not expected to adversely impact operations in the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that the reforms to china s economic system will continue or that we will not be adversely affected by changes in china s political  economic  and social conditions and by changes in policies of the chinese government  such as changes in laws and regulations  measures which may be introduced to control inflation and changes in the rate or method of taxation 
on november   china signed an agreement to become a member of the world trade organization wto  the international body that sets most trade rules  further integrating china into the global economy and significantly reducing the barriers to international commerce 
china s membership in the wto was effective on december  china has agreed upon its accession to the wto to reduce tariffs and non tariff barriers  remove investment restrictions and provide trading and distribution rights for foreign firms 
the tariff rate reductions and other enhancements will enable us to develop better investment strategies 
in addition  the wto s dispute settlement mechanism provides a credible and effective tool to enforce members commercial rights 
also  with china s entry to the wto  it is believed that the relevant laws on foreign investment in china will be amplified and will follow common practices 
the prc legal system is not fully developed and has inherent uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to investors 
the prc legal system is a system based on written statutes and their interpretation by the supreme people s court 
prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value 
since  the prc government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws  and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment  corporate organization and governance  commerce  taxation and trade 
two examples are the promulgation of the contract law of the prc to unify the various economic contract laws into a single code  which went into effect on october   and the securities law of the prc  which went into effect on july  however  because these laws and regulations are relatively new  and because of the limited volume of published cases and their non binding nature  interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties 
in addition  as the prc legal system develops  changes in such laws and regulations  their interpretation or their enforcement may have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
enforcement of regulations in china may be inconsistent 
although the chinese government has introduced new laws and regulations to modernize its securities and tax systems on january   china does not yet possess a comprehensive body of business law 
as a result  the enforcement  interpretation and implementation of regulations may prove to be inconsistent and it may be difficult to enforce contracts 
we may experience lengthy delays in resolution of legal disputes 
as china has not developed a dispute resolution mechanism similar to the western court system  dispute resolution over chinese projects and joint ventures can be difficult and there is no assurance that any dispute involving our business in china can be resolved expeditiously and satisfactorily 
we may experience an impact of the united states foreign corrupt practices act on our business 
compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act could adversely impact our competitive position  failure to comply could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 
we are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act  which generally prohibits united states companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
foreign companies  including some that may compete with us  are not subject to these prohibitions 
corruption  extortion  bribery  pay offs  theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in mainland china 
we have attempted to implement safeguards to prevent and discourage such practices by our employees and agents 
we can make no assurance  however  that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible 
if our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices  we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience a risk of revenue reduction due to currency conversions 
most of our revenue is denominated in renminbi which must be converted into other currencies before remittance out of the prc 
both the conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies and the remittance of foreign currencies abroad require approval of the prc government 
to the extent future revenue is denominated in foreign currencies  we would be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results 
to date  we have not engaged in any hedging transactions in connection with our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business due to its use of certain financial instruments 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk the majority of our operations are conducted in the prc except for some minor export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in chinese renminbi 
hence  the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rate is considered minimal to our operation 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in renminbi  which is the official currency of china 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of renminbi  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that renminbi will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of the our net assets and income derived from its operations in the prc 
interest rate risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk  as our debt obligations are primarily short term in nature  with fixed interest rates
