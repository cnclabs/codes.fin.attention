item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set out under risk factors herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our business we are a leading provider of video game accessories and software marketed under the mad catz and gameshark brands 
we design  manufacture primarily through third parties in asia  market and distribute accessories for all major video game platforms  including the microsoft xbox  nintendo gamecube  game boy advance  game boy advance sp  ds and n  sony playstation  playstation and psp  and nokia n gage qd 
in addition  we design  manufacture primarily through third parties in asia  market and distribute accessories for the apple ipod 
our products include video game accessories of all types  such as control pads  steering wheels  joysticks  memory cards  video cables  light guns  dance pads  microphones  car adapters and carry cases 
we also market game enhancement software  and in november  we published our first video game title  mc groovz dance craze  on the nintendo gamecube platform 
the game included a dance pad and was developed by a third party developer 
seasonality we generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year  our fiscal third quarter 
our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a 
table of contents result of many factors  including seasonal influences on its sales  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the introduction of new video game platforms  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and timing of introductions of new products 
see further discussion and sales by quarter under net sales below 
transition to next generation consoles our industry is cyclical and we believe it has entered into a transition stage heading into the next cycle 
over the course of the next eighteen months  we expect sony  microsoft and nintendo to introduce new video game consoles into the market 
during this transition  we intend to continue to develop and market a range of accessories to work compatibly with the new console systems and to continue to provide accessories to the significant installed base of current consoles in the marketplace 
the transition of consoles provides an opportunity for us to market products to the value oriented consumer 
in addition  we will be expanding our european distribution and adding new revenue streams to leverage our existing infrastructure 
foreign currency approximately of our annual sales are transacted outside the united states 
the majority of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
in fiscal and fiscal  we did not hedge against foreign currency exposure and we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us during fiscal conversion to us gaap in connection with our past filings with securities regulators in canada and the united states  we prepared and presented our financial data in accordance with canadian gaap 
the financial information presented in this annual report has been prepared in accordance with us gaap  and  accordingly  the information in this annual report differs in certain respects from the information previously published 
the treatment of stock based compensation in fiscal years  and differs under us gaap and canadian gaap 
as a result  the financial data included in this annual report reflects changes to the previously reported stock based compensation charges 
in addition to these specific differences  certain other differences exist between us and canadian gaap  all of which are discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note  differences between accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and in canada 
we intend to continue to publish our financial information in the future in accordance with us gaap in reports on form k  q and k and otherwise 
to the extent required by securities regulations in canada in order to maintain our listing on the toronto stock exchange  we will publish reconciliations to canadian gaap in our future filings with regulatory authorities in canada 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of our products  including interactive software licensed from third party developers 
we recognize revenue based on the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and on the criteria set forth in statement of position  software revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when all of these occur there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the products are delivered  which occurs when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable 
our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net and day terms 
revenues from sales to authorized resellers are subject to terms allowing price protection  certain rights of return and allowances for customer marketing programs 
reserves for price protection are recorded when the price protection program is approved 
allowances for estimated future returns and customer marketing programs are provided for upon revenue recognition 
such amounts are estimated and periodically adjusted based on historical and anticipated rates of returns  inventory levels and other factors and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or operating expense in accordance with eitf customer marketing programs we record allowances for customer marketing programs  including certain rights of return  price protection  volume based cash incentives and cooperative advertising 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue or as an operating expense in the period we have sold the product or committed to the program 
significant management judgments and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
we grant limited rights of return for certain products 
estimates of expected future product returns are based on analyses of historical returns and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
consistent with industry standards and practices  on a product by product basis by customer  we allow price protection credits to be issued to retailers in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the price of a product by a certain amount and issue credits to our customers to protect the customers from lower profit margins on their inventory of our products as a result of reduction in competitive prices 
the decision to effect price reductions is influenced by retailer inventory levels  product lifecycle stage  market acceptance  competitive environment and new product introductions 
credits are issued based upon the number of units that customers have on hand at the date of the price reduction 
upon approval of a price protection program  reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established 
reserves are estimated based on analyses of qualified inventories on hand with retailers and distributors 
we enter into cooperative advertising arrangements with many of our customers allowing customers to receive a credit for various advertising programs 
the amounts of the credits are based on specific dollar value programs or a percentage of sales  depending on the terms of the program negotiated with the individual customer 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these advertising programs are recorded based on the specific negotiations with individual customers in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of these cooperative advertising program accruals 

table of contents we also offer volume rebates to several of our customers and record reserves for such rebates as a reduction of revenue at the time revenue is recognized 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on programs negotiated with the specific customers 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take action to increase customer programs and incentive offerings that could result in incremental reductions to revenue or increased operating expenses at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products in the united states and internationally primarily through retailers 
we generally do not require any collateral from our customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and by purchasing credit insurance on european accounts receivable balances 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which we believe is adequate 
the allowance is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as historical experience with bad debts  receivables aging and current economic trends 
our customer base is highly concentrated and a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition  or a decline in the general economic conditions could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
as of march   one customer represented and another customer represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the eight highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivables as of march  if any of these customer s receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel in order to recognize any loss of utility in the period incurred 
software development costs software development costs primarily consist of payments made to independent software developers under development agreements 
the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which provides for the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software is established or for development costs that have alternative future uses 
under our current practice of developing new products  the technological feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially all product development is complete and the first playable version is delivered 
the software development costs that have been capitalized to date have been insignificant 
royalties and intellectual property licenses royalty and license expenses consist of royalties and license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development or sale of our products 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 

table of contents royalty based payments that are paid in advance are generally capitalized and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
with regard to payments made to independent software developers and co publishing affiliates  the company is generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of the product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred 
payments due after the general release of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
valuation of goodwill we have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions we have completed in prior periods 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prohibits amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives but instead requires testing for impairment at least annually 
we review goodwill for impairment as of april st of each fiscal year or when an event or a change in facts and or circumstances indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount 
we have completed our annual assessment of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 which did not indicate any impairment of goodwill as of march  and results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales from a geographical perspective  our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and were as follows in thousands year ended march  year ended march  change change net sales of total net sales of total united states canada europe other countries consolidated net sales net sales in fiscal increased from fiscal this increase was primarily due to new product introductions of million  offset by a decrease of million in accessories and other products

research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of developing and enhancing new and existing products in addition to the costs of developing software products
