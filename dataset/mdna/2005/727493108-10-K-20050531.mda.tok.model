the following discussions titled annual results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with those risk factors  the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
overview we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of lightweight communications headsets  telephone headset systems and accessories for the business and consumer markets 
in addition  we manufacture and market specialty telecommunication products for the hearing impaired and other related products for people with special communications needs 
we sell our broad range of communications products into more than countries through a worldwide network of distributors  original equipment manufacturers oem s  wireless carriers  retailers and telephony service providers 
we have well developed distribution channels in north america and europe  where headset use is fairly widespread 
our distribution channels in other regions of the world are less mature and primarily serve the contact center markets in those regions 
our revenues grew during the fiscal year ended march   with growth in all of our major product groups 
compared with fiscal  total revenues increased from million to million for fiscal this growth was primarily attributable to revenues from new products within the office  contact center  mobile and entertainment markets 
plantronics 
table of contents part ii demand for headsets continues to increase both in our traditional markets such as the enterprise markets  as well as in the consumer market 
in each of these markets  the trend to wireless products contributed significantly to demand  a trend we expect to continue in fiscal wireless products represent both an opportunity for high growth as well as a challenge because of the lower margins we have experienced due to competitive pressures  particularly with bluetooth mobile products 
we believe that our fiscal sales of mobile  gaming and computer products will increase in absolute dollars  but  remain fairly flat as a percentage of revenue 
we also believe that wireless products will become a greater percentage of our overall revenues 
during fiscal  our gross profit margins decreased slightly 
we increased our investments in research and development activities  marketing activities and incurred significant expense related to section sarbanes oxley compliance 
however the overall increase in operating expenses was substantially less than the growth in revenues 
consequently  our operating margin increased from to 
net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million or of revenues  compared to net income of million or of revenues in fiscal diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march  was  up approximately from per share in fiscal to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the office  contact center  mobile and entertainment markets  and to meet the challenges associated with competitive pricing  market share  and consumer acceptance  we launched several key initiatives during fiscal  which included development of new products 
we have developed a new family of bluetooth products and will continue our efforts in this area during fiscal we expect the costs related to the development of new bluetooth products to increase our research and development expenses in fiscal creation of a leading industrial design team 
this industrial design team will enhance the look of our products  where we believe that this will be a key factor in the decision to buy 
toward this end  we increased the size of our design team and made key hires to expand our expertise in this area 
we expect that the increased costs of the design team will affect our research and development expenses in fiscal bringing advanced technologies to market 
there is an emerging trend in which the communications and entertainment spaces are converging in the wireless market 
we expect this trend to result in a demand for technologies that are simple and intuitive  utilize voice technology  control noise  and rely on miniaturization and power management 
we intend to expand our own core technology group and partner with other innovative companies to develop new technologies 
we expect that the costs related to the expansion of our own core technology group will affect our research and development expenses in fiscal building consumer product manufacturing infrastructure 
the consumer products market is characterized by cost competitiveness resulting in a predominately china based manufacturing infrastructure 
in order to gain more flexibility in our supply chain  to better manage inventories and to reduce costs  we are building a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
we began construction on this facility in december and expect to begin operations there in fiscal through march   we have spent approximately million on plant construction  and  over the next twelve months  we plan to invest approximately more to complete the development of the facility 
greater focus on branding and marketing 
by expanding our marketing headcount  including hiring key positions and combining key products with an advertising program  we believe we will strengthen our brand position for the consumer markets and help category adoption 
we intend to launch a national  integrated marketing campaign in fiscal focusing on wireless office ar 
table of contents products 
therefore  we intend to increase our advertising spending in the us  and we expect the costs to affect our selling  general and administrative results in fiscal looking forward  we are focused on the implementation of our key initiatives 
if successful  we can capitalize on these high growth  emerging markets with competitively priced products  which are attractive to the consumer 
in addition  during fiscal  we generated million in operating cash flows  which significantly contributed to the increase in our liquidity and cash balances at march  we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements

fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands march  march  march  march  increase increase net revenues from unaffiliated customers office and contact center mobile gaming and computer audio other specialty products total net revenues united states europe  middle east and africa asia pacific and latin america canada total international total net revenues in comparison to fiscal  the increase in net sales for fiscal was geographically broad based and across all major product lines and sales channels 
the increase was driven primarily by continued sales of our new product lines 
we define new products as products which have been shipped to customers in volume for eight or less quarters 
both domestic and international sales were up  resulting  in part  from increased demand for headsets for mobile phones and wireless headsets for the office  as well as from the favorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international revenues 
the increase in our office and contact center products was linked to continued success of our cs  a wireless headset for mhz based office phones  cs  a wireless headset for dect based office phones and supraplus headsets 
the increase in sales for our gaming and computer products was primarily attributable to shipments of our halo headset for the xbox and revenues from headsets for voip applications 
mobile product sales saw strong growth with the mx and bluetooth related products 
the increases were primarily attributable to two factors  one  in the us wireless carrier market  we participated in promotional bundles which were offered by wireless carriers  and two  increased demand for bluetooth enabled headsets  particularly in europe where this technology has greater market acceptance than in the u 
s 
market 
sales from our specialty products  which are principally our clarity products marketed for hearing impaired individuals  grew primarily from sales of new product models  wireless products and increased distribution through our retail channels 
within our sales channels  our distributors successfully captured the growing demand for wireless office products  retailers increased revenues with computer products for gaming and voip applications  and the oem channel achieved continued success with promotional bundles of mobile headsets with cellular handsets 
ar 
table of contents the wireless market continues to grow coupled with a trend toward the convergence of audio and entertainment 
this results in a greater need to be able to communicate more freely and effectively 
our ability to innovate enables us to create compelling communication solutions and capture these opportunities 
in comparison to fiscal  sales for fiscal were stronger across all major product lines and were also driven by sales of new products 
both domestic and international revenues were up  resulting in part from increased demand due to hands free legislation  increased demand for headsets for mobile phones and for wireless headsets for the office  the favorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international revenues  and the incremental sales from the additional rd week 
because our fiscal year always ends on the closest saturday following march  our fiscal year periodically will have weeks rather than weeks 
in fiscal  we had a week fiscal calendar 
the incremental effect of the rd week contributed approximately million or of the increase year over year based on a linear calculation 
our headsets for mobile phones include both corded headsets sold to us wireless carriers and bluetooth based headsets sold primarily for use in europe with yearly sales up over the prior fiscal year 
our office and contact center products business grew from the prior year  primarily driven by the continued ramp of our cs product in europe 
in the us  office and contact center product sales were favorably affected by the launch of our cs product 
computer audio product sales  which grew compared to the prior year  were primarily due to expanded retail distribution channels 
domestic sales for fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of total sales remained at approximately  which compares to for fiscal domestic sales were up in fiscal in absolute dollars and across all major channels  primarily driven by demand for office and contact center products  demand for gaming products  and the demand for mobile products including wireless bluetooth headsets 
international revenues for fiscal were favorably affected by the continued strengthening of the european exchange rates against the us dollar  sales of our cs product  and sales related to voip applications and bluetooth 
in comparison to fiscal  domestic sales in fiscal increased in all major us channels  with the most significant increase in our oem distribution channel 
international sales in fiscal compared to fiscal increased  reflecting growth in each of the european  asia pacific latin american and canadian regions 
sales were favorably affected by the continued strengthening of the euro and the great british pound against the us dollar  new product introductions during the year  and sales from the extra week in fiscal revenues may vary due to the timing of the introduction of new products  seasonality  discounts and other incentives  and channel mix 
we have a book and ship business model  whereby we ship most orders to our customers within hours of receipt of those orders  thus  we cannot rely on the level of backlog to provide visibility into potential future revenues

plantronics 
table of contents part ii in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal gross profit margins decreased slightly  which was primarily due to a mix shift towards lower margin products  particularly our bluetooth products within our mobile products and a greater contribution of wireless products within our office and contact center products 
these were offset in part by continued component cost reductions  manufacturing efficiencies and favorable exchange rates net of hedging losses 
in comparison to fiscal  fiscal gross profit margin strengthened as a result of improved manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes  component cost reductions  and favorable foreign exchange rates 
a weaker us dollar compared to the euro and great british pound favorably affected revenues and consequently gross profit  although hedging losses dampened this effect 
partially offsetting these favorable factors was a higher percentage of sales coming from lower margin mobile and wireless office products compared to the prior year 
gross profit margin may vary depending on the product mix  customer mix  channel mix  amount of excess and obsolete inventory charges  changes in our warranty repair costs or return rates  and other factors

in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal research  development and engineering expenses  reflect  our substantial commitment to developing new products for all the markets we serve 
the primary reasons for the increases were as follows design and development of a new suite of bluetooth products 
these new bluetooth products are our third generation of bluetooth technology and include not only a new chip set but also a re vamped style and design which is geared for the more fashion conscious market 
substantial increase in the industrial design headcount and related expenses 
the industrial design team is focused on inventing new concepts to make our headsets more attractive and comfortable for end users 
growth of the plamex design center 
we are in the process of adding headcount to our plamex design center located at our tijuana  mexico  manufacturing facility 
we are moving the project execution  build  and verification processes to be co located with the teams  which are responsible for the manufacturing in order to improve execution  efficiency  and cost effectiveness 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in fiscal year in the following areas continued investment in the wireless office and wireless mobile markets  gaming products and the small office and home markets 
establishing a new research and development center that will be co located with our under construction manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
associated costs with new technologies acquired in connection with the recent acquisition of octiv inc ar

in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily for the following reasons an increase in global sales and marketing programs designed to generate demand for our wireless office  gaming  voip products  and other new products  entrance into marketing programs to leverage hands free regulatory laws  especially in the japanese market  launch new products  and start a national brand awareness program  costs related to work performed for our sarbanes oxley section compliance and attestation fees  and an adverse impact from higher foreign exchange rates  particularly with the great british pound and the euro against the dollar 
these expenses were partially offset by a one time benefit of approximately million from a favorable court ruling  which ended a lawsuit filed by one of our competitors during the quarter ended september  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were higher  mainly driven by higher legal expenses  a larger provision for doubtful accounts  and the inclusion of a full year of expenses relating to ameriphone

in comparison to fiscal  operating income for fiscal increased primarily from higher revenues and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues due to economies of scale  but was in part offset by lower margin products as a result of the change in our product mix 
as a result  operating margin increased from to 
we believe an operating margin goal of or better is reasonable for fiscal and probably beyond 
plantronics 
table of contents part ii in fiscal  the increase in operating income over fiscal was primarily driven by higher net sales and improved gross margins due to economies of scale  offset in part by higher operating expenses and unfavorable product mix

in comparison to fiscal  interest and other income  net for fiscal  increased primarily from higher interest income as a result of higher cash and short term investment balances and approximately million in interest received from a one time litigation settlement 
this was offset in part by lower foreign currency transaction gains  net of the effect of hedging activity of million compared to foreign currency transaction gains  net of the effect of hedging activity  for fiscal of million 
in comparison to fiscal  interest and other income  net for fiscal decreased due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates on both the euro and great british pound  partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of higher cash balances 
income tax expense fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands march  march  increase march  march  increase decrease decrease income before income taxes income tax expense net income effective tax rate on october   the president of the united states of america signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of today  uncertainty remains as how to interpret numerous provisions of the act 
as of march   our management had not decided whether to  or to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings under the act and accordingly  the financial statements do not reflect any provision for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 
permanently reinvested foreign earnings were approximately million at march  management will prepare its analysis for the board of directors on this issue during fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  the successful completion of routine tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations resulted in favorable tax adjustments of million  million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting the million favorable tax adjustments in was a write off of ar 
table of contents million relating to a tax asset that was recorded in connection with the leveraged buy out that occurred in september of this tax asset arose in connection with the book versus tax basis difference on certain fixed assets 
the tax asset should have been recorded as a component of income tax expense as the related fixed assets were depreciated  impaired or sold  which would have resulted in additional tax expense being recorded over no more than the seven years subsequent to the leveraged buy out 
management and the audit committee evaluated this write off and determined that it was immaterial to prior years reported results and to the current year s results  so the adjustment was included in income tax expense in fiscal the net of the favorable tax adjustments of million and the write off was a favorable million adjustment to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal the combination of our international tax restructuring  the completion of a routine tax audit and the adjustment to write off the tax asset resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately for the fourth quarter of fiscal pre tax earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we are currently estimating a tax rate of approximately for fiscal we have significant operations in various tax jurisdictions 
currently  some of these operations are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
if our income in these lower tax jurisdictions were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed  our tax rate would be materially affected 
financial condition the table below provides selected consolidated cash flow information  for the periods indicated fiscal year ended in thousands march  march  increase decrease cash provided by operating activities cash used for capital expenditures cash used for all other investing activities cash used for investing activities cash provided by used for financing activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent the most significant source of funding 
for the fiscal  compared to the prior year  cash flows provided by operating activities increased significantly 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  were primarily driven by net income earned on higher sales volume offset in part by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances 
our inventory balances increased proportionally with increased revenues  decisions to increase our inventory safety stock  and other factors 
we have a goal of improving our inventory turns to by the december fiscal quarter  while for the fiscal as a whole  we ended at turns 
the accounts receivable increase was primarily driven by the strong growth in sales coupled with the impact of the strengthening of the great british pound and the euro against the us dollar 
our days sales outstanding dso increased to days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal from days at the end of fiscal our increase in dso is primarily attributable to the increase in the amount and proportion of international sales to our domestic sales 
in international locations  trade terms that are standard in their locales may extend longer than is standard in the u 
s 
this may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative impact on our cash flow provided by operating activities 
we believe that the net receivable balance is collectible and that we have sufficient reserves to cover our exposure to bad debt 
new accounting rules effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal require that plantronics 
table of contents part ii cash benefits resulting from the tax deductibility of increases in the value of equity instruments issued under share based arrangements be included as part of cash flows from financing activities rather than from operating activities 
this change in classification will likely have a significant negative effect on our cash provided by operating activities in periods after adoption of these new rules 
see recent accounting pronouncements included in footnote of this form k 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  collection of accounts receivable  changes to inventory levels  and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities during fiscal  our total capital expenditures were million  including million for our china manufacturing facility  which is still under construction and will not begin depreciating until it has been placed into service 
the remainder of the capital purchases were incurred principally in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures  and building improvements for facilities expansion 
additionally  during fiscal  we purchased approximately million of marketable securities  which were offset by sales and maturities of a portion of our marketable securities of approximately million 
these marketable securities consist primarily of bonds and auction rate securities 
as noted in note of the consolidated financial statements  marketable securities related to auction rate securities previously classified as cash equivalents  have been reclassified to short term marketable securities 
for fiscal  cash flows for investing activities decreased million compared to the prior year 
the reduction is primarily due to the increase of million in the purchase of marketable securities  mainly comprised of auction rate securities  compared to the prior year 
we anticipate making further investments in marketable securities as interest rates continue to rise in order to obtain more favorable yields 
as our business grows  we may need additional facilities and capital expenditures to support this growth 
we continuously evaluate new business opportunities and new markets 
if we pursue new opportunities or markets in areas in which we do not have existing facilities  we may need additional expenditures to support future expansion 
during fiscal  our total capital expenditures were million  which included the land and facilities purchase of our previously leased facilities in swindon  uk  for approximately million 
the remainder of the capital purchases were incurred primarily in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures  leasehold and building improvements for facilities expansion 
during the fiscal year  we purchased approximately million of marketable securities  which were offset by sales and maturities of a portion of our marketable securities of approximately million 
these marketable securities consisted primarily of bonds and auction rate securities 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility with a major bank for million  including a letter of credit sub facility 
the facility and sub facility both expire on july  as of april   we had no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit sub facility 
the amounts outstanding under the letter of credit sub facility were principally associated with purchases of inventory 
the terms of the credit facility contain covenants that materially limit our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  among other things 
under our current credit facility agreement  we have the ability to declare dividends so long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends declared  or paid  and common stock repurchased  or redeemed  in any four consecutive fiscal quarter periods  shall not exceed of the amount of cumulative consolidated net income in the eight consecutive fiscal quarter periods ending with the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date as of which the applicable distributions occurred 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants and the dividend provision under this agreement

table of contents compared to the fiscal year ended march  we anticipate our capital expenditures will approximately double in fiscal the largest single initiative is to complete the plant and design center in china  where we plan to spend approximately an additional million 
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal  cash flows used for financing activities were approximately million 
this was primarily due to repurchases of  shares of our common stock totaling million at an average price of per share and payment of cash dividends totaling million 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized plantronics to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock 
as of march   we were authorized to repurchase  shares under all repurchase plans 
these cash outflows were offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling million and reissuance of  shares of our treasury stock through employee benefit plans totaling million 
during fiscal  cash flows from financing activities were approximately million 
this was primarily due to proceeds from exercises of stock options of approximately million and proceeds from the reissuance of  shares treasury stock through employee benefit plans totaling million  offset by repurchases of  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
the plan approved by the board anticipates a total annualized dividend of per common share 
the actual declaration of future dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates is subject to final determination by the audit committee of the board of directors of plantronics each quarter after its review of our financial position and performance 
during fiscal  we declared and paid million in dividends 
we did not declare any dividends during fiscal our liquidity  capital resources  and results of operations in any period could be affected by the exercise of outstanding stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares could also affect our per share results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions or invest in other businesses 
based upon our past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and financing activities for at least the next twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources we generated positive cash flows from operations for fiscal and fiscal totaling million and million  respectively 
our primary cash requirements have been  and are expected to continue to be  for capital expenditures  including investment in our under construction manufacturing operations in china  tooling for new products  and leasehold improvements for facilities improvements and expansion 
we estimate that fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately million

the terms of the credit facility contain covenants that materially limit our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  among other matters 
these covenants may adversely affect us to the extent we cannot comply with them 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under this agreement 
throughout fiscal and  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of expected foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  throughout fiscal and  we entered into a hedging program to hedge a portion of forecasted revenues denominated in the euro and great british pound with put and call option contracts used as collars 
at each reporting period  we record the net fair value of our unrealized option contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholder equity

auction rate securities in the amount of million as of march  have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments in the march  consolidated balance sheet to conform to the fiscal financial statement presentation 
accordingly  the statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended march  and reflect this presentation 
we have revised our presentation to exclude from cash and cash equivalents million of auction rate securities at march  and to include such amounts as marketable securities 
in addition  we have made corresponding adjustments to the accompanying statements of cash flows to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities 
this adjustment resulted in a net increase of million in cash used for investing activities and a net increase of million in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon plantronics consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we base estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that plantronics management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory warranty goodwill and intangibles income taxes revenue recognition revenue from sales of products to customers is recognized when title and risk of ownership are transferred to customers  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue net of estimated product returns plantronics 
table of contents part ii and expected payments to resellers for customer programs including cooperative advertising  marketing development funds  volume rebates  and special pricing programs 
estimated product returns are deducted from revenues upon shipment  based on historical return rates  the product stage relative to its expected life cycle  and assumptions regarding the rate of sell through to end users from our various channels based on historical sell through rates 
should product lives vary significantly from our estimates  or should a particular selling channel experience a higher than estimated return rate  or a slower sell through rate causing inventory build up  then our estimated returns  which net against revenue  may need to be revised and could have an adverse impact on revenues 
reductions to revenue for expected and actual payments to resellers for volume rebates and pricing protection are based on actual expenses incurred during the period  estimates for what is due to resellers for estimated credits earned during the period and any adjustments for credits based on actual activity 
if the actual payments exceed our estimates  this could result in an adverse impact on our revenues 
since we have historically been able to reliably estimate the amount of allowances required for future price adjustments and product returns  we recognize revenue  net of projected allowances  upon shipment to our customers 
in situations where we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of future price adjustments and product returns  we defer recognition of the revenue until the right to future price adjustments and product returns lapses  and we are no longer under any obligation to reduce the price or accept the return of the product 
if market conditions warrant  plantronics may take action to stimulate demand  which could include increasing promotional programs  decreasing prices  or increasing discounts 
such actions could result in incremental reductions to revenue and margins at the time such incentives are offered 
to the extent that we reduce pricing  we may incur reductions to revenue for price protection based on our estimate of inventory in the channel that is subject to such pricing actions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessments of our customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expense 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for excess and obsolete inventories 
write downs are determined by reviewing our demand forecast and by determining what inventory  if any  are not saleable 
our demand forecast projects future shipments using historical rates and takes into account market conditions  inventory on hand  purchase commitments  product development plans and product life expectancy  inventory on consignment  and other competitive factors 
if our demand forecast is greater than actual demand  and we fail to reduce our manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
ar 
table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of warranties as part of our cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and our costs to repair or replace the products  as well as the number of shipments in a quarter 
should actual failure rates  actual returns and costs differ from our estimates  revisions to our warranty obligation may be required  which may affect our cost of sales 
goodwill and intangibles as a result of acquisitions we have made  we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
goodwill has been measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the amount assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we perform at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  a review to determine if the carrying value of the goodwill and intangibles is impaired 
our review process for determining the carrying value is complex and utilizes estimates for future cash flow  discount rates  growth rates  estimated costs  and other factors  which utilize both historical data  internal estimates  and  in some cases  external consultants and outside data 
if our estimates are inaccurate or if the underlying business requirements change  our goodwill and intangibles may become impaired  and we may be required to take an impairment charge 
income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations  tax credits  state taxes  and other factors 
our future effective tax rates could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income  tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions  changes in tax laws in the united states or internationally  a change which would result in a valuation allowance being required to be taken  or a federal  state or foreign jurisdiction s view of tax returns which differs materially from what we originally provided 
we assess the probability of adverse outcomes from tax examinations regularly to determine the adequacy of our reserve for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to evaluate on an ongoing basis whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets 
if recovery were not likely  we would be required to establish a valuation allowance 
as of the end of the fiscal year ended march   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  however  if there were a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not probable 
risk factors affecting future operating results investors or potential investors in our stock should carefully consider the risks described below 
our stock price will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  our competition  expectations of securities analysts or investors  general economic and market conditions and industry conditions 
you should carefully consider the following factors in connection with any investment in our stock 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of the risks occur 
should any or all of the following risks materialize  the trading price of our stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
we depend on the development of the office  mobile  computer and residential markets  and we could be materially adversely affected if they do not develop as we expect 
while the contact center market is still a substantial portion of our business  we believe that our future prospects will depend in large part on the growth in demand for headsets in the office  mobile  computer  residential and related wireless markets 
these communications headset markets are relatively new and continue to be developed 
moreover  we do not have extensive experience in selling headset products to plantronics 
table of contents part ii customers in these markets 
if the demand for headsets in these markets fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we are unable to effectively market our products to customers in these markets  it could lead to lower and more volatile revenue and earnings  excess inventory and the inability to recover the associated development costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
these headset markets are also subject to general economic conditions and if there is a slowing of national or international economic growth  these markets may not materialize to the levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results  which could in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our stock 
in particular  we may accept returns from our retailers of products which have failed to sell as expected  and in some instances  such products may be returned to our inventory 
should product returns vary significantly from our estimate  then our estimated returns  which net against revenue  may need to be revised 
we have strong competitors and expect to face additional competition in the future 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of companies in the various markets for communications headsets 
the actions of our competitors  particularly with regard to pricing and promotional programs  could have a negative impact on our prices and profitability 
currently  our single largest competitor is gn netcom  a subsidiary of gn great nordic ltd  a danish telecommunications conglomerate 
internationally  sennheiser communications is a significant competitor in the computer  office and contact center market 
we currently operate principally in a multilevel distribution model we sell most of our products to distributors who  in turn  resell to dealers or end customers 
gn netcom s acquisitions indicate it may be moving towards a direct sales model  since six of their nine acquisitions were of companies employing direct sales and marketing models 
while we believe that our business and our customers benefit from our current distribution structure  if gn netcom or other competitors sell directly  they may offer lower prices  which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we also expect to face additional competition from companies that currently do not offer communications headsets 
we believe that this is particularly true in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
for example  the sony ericsson joint venture has also announced the launch of several bluetooth hands free solutions 
we anticipate other competition from consumer electronics companies that currently manufacture and sell mobile phones or computer peripheral equipment 
these new competitors are likely to be larger  offer broader product lines  bundle or integrate with other products communications headset tops and bases manufactured by them or others  offer products containing bases that are incompatible with our headset tops and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we also expect to face additional competition from companies  principally located in the far east  which offer very low cost headset products  including products which are modeled on  or are direct copies of our products 
these new competitors are likely to offer very low cost products which may result in price pressure in the market 
if market prices are substantially reduced by such new entrants into the headset market  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
new product development is risky  and our business will be materially adversely affected if we are not able to develop  manufacture and market new products in response to changing customer requirements and new technologies 
historically  the technology used in lightweight communications headsets has evolved slowly 
new products have primarily offered stylistic changes and quality improvements  rather than significant new ar 
table of contents technologies 
the technology used in hands free communications devices  including our products  is evolving more rapidly now than it has historically  and we anticipate that this trend may accelerate 
we believe this is particularly true for our newer emerging technology products especially in the mobile  computer  residential and certain parts of the office markets 
we believe products designed to serve these markets generally exhibit shorter lifecycles and are increasingly based on open standards and protocols 
as we develop new generations of products more quickly  we expect that the pace of product obsolescence will  increase concurrently 
the disposition of inventories of obsolete products may result in reductions to our operating margins and materially adversely affect our earnings and results of operations 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing market requirements  and to develop  manufacture  market and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and end user requirements 
the technologies  products and solutions that we choose to pursue may not become as commercially successful as we planned 
we may experience difficulties in realizing the expected benefits from our investments in new technologies 
if we are unable to develop  manufacture  market and introduce enhanced or new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  including changing fashion trends and styles  it will materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our corporate tax rate may increase  which could adversely impact our cash flow  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant operations in various tax jurisdictions throughout the world and a substantial portion of our taxable income historically has been generated in these jurisdictions 
currently  some of our operations are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
if our income in these lower tax jurisdictions were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  if us or other foreign tax authorities were to change applicable foreign tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized  our overall taxes could increase  and our business  cash flow  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in regulatory requirements may adversely impact our gross margins as we comply with such changes or reduce our ability to generate revenues if we are unable to comply 
our products must meet the requirements set by regulatory authorities in the numerous jurisdictions in which we sell them 
as regulations and local laws change  we must modify our products to address those changes 
regulatory restrictions may increase the costs to design and manufacture our products  resulting in a decrease in our margins or a decrease in demand for our products if the costs are passed along 
compliance with regulatory restrictions may impact the technical quality and capabilities of our products reducing their marketability 
a significant portion of our sales come from the contact center market and a decline in demand in that market could materially adversely affect our results 
we derive approximately to of our net sales from the contact center market  and we expect that this market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
while we believe that this market may grow in future periods  this growth could be slow or revenues from this market could be flat or decline in response to various factors 
for example  legislation enabling consumers to block telemarketing calls may adversely affect growth in the contact center market 
a deterioration in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in the establishment of new contact centers and in capital investments to expand or upgrade existing centers  which could negatively affect our business 
because of our reliance on the contact center market  we will be affected more by changes in the rate of contact center establishment and expansion and the communications products that contact center agents use than plantronics 
table of contents part ii would a company serving a broader market 
any decrease in the demand for contact centers and related headset products could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we are seeing a proliferation of speech activated and voice interactive software in the market place 
we have been re assessing long term growth prospects for the contact center market given the growth rate and the advancement of these new voice recognition based technologies 
businesses that first embraced them to resolve labor shortages at the peak of the last economic up cycle are now increasing spending on these technologies in hopes of reducing total costs 
we may experience a decline in our sales to the contact center market if businesses increase their adoption of speech activated and voice interactive software as an alternative to customer service agents 
should this trend continue  it could cause a net reduction in contact center agents and our revenues to this market segment could decline rather than grow in future years 
if we do not match production to demand  we will be at risk of losing business or our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
historically  we have generally been able to increase production to meet increasing demand 
however  the demand for our products is dependent on many factors and such demand is inherently difficult to forecast 
we have experienced sharp fluctuations in demand  especially for headsets for wireless and cellular phones 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand and the global trend towards consignment of products could cause the following operating problems  among others if forecasted demand does not develop  we could have excess inventory and excess capacity 
over forecast of demand could result in higher inventories of finished products  components and subassemblies 
if we were unable to sell these inventories  we would have to write off some or all of our inventories of excess products and unusable components and subassemblies 
excess manufacturing capacity could lead to higher production costs and lower margins 
if demand increases beyond that forecasted  we would have to rapidly increase production 
we depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and subassemblies  and are experiencing greater dependencies on single source suppliers 
therefore  we might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand 
this could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations 
there could be short term losses of sales while we are trying to increase production 
if customers turn to competitive sources of supply to meet their needs  there could be a long term impact on our revenues 
rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for components and subassemblies  increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials  and higher overtime costs and other expenses 
these higher expenditures could lower our profit margins 
further  if production is increased rapidly  there may be decreased manufacturing yields  which may also lower our margins 
the introduction of bluetooth and other wireless headsets presents many significant manufacturing  marketing and other operational risks and uncertainties  including developing and marketing these wireless headset products  unforeseen delays or difficulties in introducing and achieving volume production of such products  our dependence on third parties to supply key components  many of which have long lead times  and our ability to forecast demand and customer return rates accurately for this new product category for which relevant data is incomplete or not available 
we have longer lead times with certain suppliers than commitments from some of our customers 
in particular  a major customer only provides us with a day commitment while we commit to inventory purchases beyond this time period 
as this inventory is unique to this customer and we have no alternative means of selling any finished products  this could potentially result in significant write downs of excess inventories 
ar 
table of contents any of the foregoing problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
future acquisitions involve material risks 
we may in the future acquire other companies 
there are inherent risks in acquiring other companies or businesses that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with acquisitions include  among others cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired company  the risk that the consolidation of the acquired company may not produce the enhanced efficiencies or be as successful as we may have anticipated  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  difficulties in integrating the transactions and business information systems of the acquired company  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions  particularly those of high technology companies  are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also manage any acquisition related growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
the failure of our suppliers to provide quality components or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our results 
our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials  components  subassemblies and products from our suppliers 
we buy raw materials  components and subassemblies from a variety of suppliers and assemble them into finished products 
we also have certain of our products manufactured for us by third party suppliers 
the cost  quality  and availability of such goods are essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
obtaining raw materials  components  subassemblies and finished products entails various risks  including the following we obtain certain raw materials  subassemblies  components and products from single suppliers and alternate sources for these items are not readily available 
to date  we have experienced only minor interruptions in the supply of these raw materials  subassemblies  components and products  none of which has significantly affected our results of operations 
our bluetooth chipset supplier has reported to us that one of their suppliers had a fire in its factory 
our suppliers recovery process will determine our ability to ship our anticipated bluetooth headset demand 
adverse economic conditions could lead to a higher risk of failure of our suppliers to remain in business or to be able to purchase the raw materials  subcomponents and parts required by them to produce and provide to us the parts we need 
an interruption in supply from any of our single source suppliers in the future would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
prices of raw materials  components and subassemblies may rise 
if this occurs and we are not able to pass these increases on to our customers or to achieve operating efficiencies that would offset the increases  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
plantronics 
table of contents part ii due to the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials  subassemblies  components and products from certain foreign suppliers  we may not be able to react quickly to changes in demand  potentially resulting in either excess inventories of such goods or shortages of the raw materials  subassemblies  components and products 
lead times are particularly long on silicon based components incorporating radio frequency and digital signal processing technologies and such components are an increasingly important part of our product costs 
failure in the future to match the timing of purchases of raw materials  subassemblies  components and products to demand could increase our inventories and or decrease our revenues  consequently materially adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to provide us with raw materials  components and subassemblies 
rather  we buy most raw materials  components and subassemblies on a purchase order basis 
if our suppliers experience increased demand or shortages  it could affect deliveries to us 
in turn  this would affect our ability to manufacture and sell products that are dependent on those raw materials  components and subassemblies 
this would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we generally use standard raw materials  parts and components for our products  the high development costs associated with emerging wireless technologies permits us to work with only a single source of silicon chip sets on any particular new product 
we  or our chosen supplier of chip sets  may experience challenges in designing  developing and manufacturing components in these new technologies which could affect our ability to meet time to market schedules 
due to our dependence on single suppliers for certain chip sets  we could experience higher prices  a delay in development of the chip set  and or the inability to meet our customer demand for these new products 
our business  operating results and financial condition could therefore be materially adversely affected as a result of these factors 
we sell our products through various channels of distribution that can be volatile 
we sell substantially all of our products through distributors  retailers  oem s and telephony service providers 
our existing relationships with these parties are not exclusive and can be terminated by either party without cause 
our channel partners also sell or can potentially sell products offered by our competitors 
to the extent that our competitors offer our channel partners more favorable terms  such partners may decline to carry  de emphasize or discontinue carrying our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified channel partners 
further  such partners may not recommend  or continue to recommend  our products 
in the future  our oem customers or potential oem customers may elect to manufacture their own products  similar to those we currently sell to them 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors  oem s  retailers and telephony service providers or to expand our distribution channels could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of the growth of our mobile headset business  our customer mix is changing and certain oem s and wireless carriers are becoming significant 
this greater reliance on certain large customers could increase the volatility of our revenues and earnings 
in particular  we have several large customers whose order patterns are difficult to predict 
offers and promotions by these customers may result in significant fluctuations of their purchasing activities over time 
if we are unable to anticipate the purchase requirements of these customers  our quarterly revenues may be adversely affected and or we may be exposed to large volumes of inventory that cannot be immediately resold to other customers

we have significant foreign operations and there are inherent risks in operating abroad 
during our fourth quarter of fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were derived from customers outside the united states 
in addition  we conduct the majority of our headset assembly operations in our manufacturing facility located in mexico  and we obtain most of the components and subassemblies used in our products from various foreign suppliers 
we also purchase a growing number of turn key products directly from asia 
the inherent risks of international operations  either in mexico or in asia  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include  among others cultural differences in the conduct of business  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  impact of recessions in economies outside of the united states  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political conditions in each country  management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
we have intellectual property rights that could be infringed by others and we are potentially at risk of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our copyrights  patents  trademarks  trade dress  trade secrets  and other intellectual property  including our rights to certain domain names 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent  trademark  trade secret  and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights 
effective trademark  patent  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed to customers 
we currently hold united states patents and additional foreign patents and will continue to seek patents on our inventions when we believe it to be appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive 
patents may not be issued in response to our applications  and patents that are issued may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged by others 
if we are required to enforce our patents or other proprietary rights through litigation  the costs and diversion of management s attention could be substantial 
in addition  the rights granted under any patents may not provide us competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property rights  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ar 
table of contents we are exposed to potential lawsuits alleging defects in our products and or hearing loss caused by our products 
the use of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability and hearing loss claims 
these claims have in the past been  and are currently being  asserted against us 
none of the previously resolved claims have materially affected our business  financial condition or results of operations  nor do we believe that any of the pending claims will have such an effect 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability or hearing loss claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our mobile headsets are used with mobile telephones 
there has been continuing public controversy over whether the radio frequency emissions from mobile telephones are harmful to users of mobile phones 
we believe that there is no conclusive proof of any health hazard from the use of mobile telephones but that research in this area is incomplete 
we have tested our headsets through independent laboratories and have found that use of our corded headsets reduces radio frequency emissions at the user s head to virtually zero 
our bluetooth and other wireless headsets emit significantly less powerful radio frequency emissions than mobile phones 
however  if research was to establish a health hazard from the use of mobile telephones or public controversy grows even in the absence of conclusive research findings  there could be an adverse impact on the demand for mobile phones  which reduces demands for headset products 
likewise  should research establish a link between radio frequency emissions and wireless headsets and public concern in this area grow  demand for our wireless headsets could be reduced creating a material adverse effect on our financial results 
there is also continuing and increasing public controversy over the use of mobile telephones by operators of motor vehicles 
while we believe that our products enhance driver safety by permitting a motor vehicle operator to generally be able to keep both hands free to operate the vehicle  there is no certainty that this is the case and we may be subject to claims arising from allegations that use of a mobile telephone and headset contributed to a motor vehicle accident 
we maintain product liability insurance and general liability insurance that we believe would cover any such claims 
however  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe we comply with environmental laws and regulations  we are still exposed to potential risks from environmental matters 
we are actively working to gain an understanding of the complete requirements concerning the removal of certain potentially environmentally sensitive materials from our products to comply with the european union directives on restrictions on certain hazardous substances on electrical and electronic equipment rohs and on waste electrical and electronic equipment weee 
some of our customers are requesting that we implement these new compliance standards sooner than the legislation would require 
while we believe that we will have the resources and ability to fully meet our customers requests  and spirit of the rohs and weee directives  if unusual occurrences arise or if we are wrong in our assessment of what it will take to fully comply  there is a risk that we will not be able to meet the aggressive schedule set by our customers or comply with the legislation as passed by the eu member states 
if that were to happen  a material negative effect on our financial results may occur 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been plantronics 
table of contents part ii enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we have included in our financial statements a reserve of million for possible environmental remediation of the site of one of our previous businesses 
while no claims have been asserted against us in connection with this matter  such claims could be asserted in the future and any liability that might result could exceed the amount of the reserve 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose the benefit of the services of key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees 
the unanticipated loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
while we believe that we currently have adequate control structures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act the act of  which became law in july  requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and or compliance practices 
as part of the act s requirements  the securities and exchange commission has been promulgating new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to other rule proposals  and the nyse has enacted new corporate governance listing requirements 
these developments have increased our accounting and legal compliance costs and could also expose us to additional liability 
in addition  such developments may make retention and recruitment of qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or executive management more difficult 
we continue to evaluate and monitor regulatory and legislative developments and cannot reliably estimate the timing or magnitude of all costs we may incur as a result of the act or other related legislation or regulation 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
further  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the first quarter of calendar year  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of april  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors affecting future operating results 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at march  compared to million at march  we had marketable securities of million and million at march  and  respectively 
cash equivalents have a maturity when purchased of days or less  marketable securities have a maturity of greater than days  and are classified as available for sale 
as of march   we were not exposed to significant interest rate risk as all of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in securities or interest bearing accounts with maturities of less than days 
nearly all our investments in marketable securities are held in our name at a limited number of major financial institutions and consist primarily of bonds and auction rate securities the taxable equivalent interest rates realized on these investments averaged for fiscal our investment policy generally requires that we only invest in auction rate securities  deposit accounts  certificates of deposit or commercial paper with minimum ratings of a p and money market mutual funds with minimum ratings of aaa

the facility and subfacility both expire on july  as of april   we had no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility 
the terms of the credit facility contain covenants that materially limit our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  among other matters 
these covenants may adversely affect us to the extent we cannot comply with them 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under this agreement
