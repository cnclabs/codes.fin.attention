the company resells  from third party vendors  certain hardware products  including intelligent fax boards and fax modems  to its customers 
hardware sales are undertaken as a convenience to the company s customers  who alternatively can opt to obtain hardware from a third party vendor 
the fax boards and fax modems that are resold are not functional without the company s software and the company is not in the business of selling fax boards and modems generally 
the company purchases these hardware products as needed to ship to its customers and the company maintains a minimal inventory of these hardware products 
management believes that it has a good business relationship with suppliers of these products and that supply of these products is stable 
service and other revenues have historically consisted primarily of the sale of support contracts 
the company generates a smaller portion of its service and other revenues from consulting  training and installation services 
the company s results improved during as compared to as indicated by the generation of net income of million in as compared to a net loss of million in the improvement in financial results was due primarily to an increase in revenue of approximately million during as compared to and realized operating cost savings resulting from a corporate restructuring in management attributes this increase in revenues to increased demand for enterprise software solutions  which has led to an increase in information technology spending and is also due to greater market acceptance of the accuroute product  both of which resulted in increased sales bookings for the company 
offsetting some of the growth in accuroute software license revenues was a decrease in software license revenue from the company s fax products 
the decrease in fax revenues has had a more significant impact on the company s european operations more than it has on its united states operations 
the company expects that software license revenues from its fax products will continue to decline in  although at a reduced pace as compared to the company believes that the key to near term success in both the european and us operations is in the legal vertical market 
the company will continue to leverage its accuroute base in europe  as well as its indirect channel relationships  to focus sales resources on the legal vertical and expects that the european results will start to improve more predictably over the course of these changes along with increased investments in sales and marketing resources and an increase in general and administrative expenses associated with the preparation for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations will put pressure on the company s earnings during presently  the company is not an accelerated filer as that term is defined in the securities act 
if the company were to become an accelerated filer for the fiscal year ending on december   then commencing with the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   management of the company would be required to deliver a report regarding its determination of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting and the company s independent registered public accounting firm would be required to deliver an attestation report regarding their assessment and management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
if the company remains a non accelerated filer as of december   it will not have to comply with these requirements until the filing of its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december  the company believes that the opportunity to expand accuroute sales  establish omtool as a leader in the legal vertical market and position accuroute and the company for long term growth in this new and expanding market justifies these investments at this time 
during the year ended december   the company raised million through the sale of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  in a private placement to institutional and other accredited investors 
the company is using the proceeds of this transaction for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes 
also during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock from asa international ltd  an existing shareholder  in a private transaction at a price of per share 
the company effected this purchase with generally available corporate funds and the repurchased shares will be held in treasury 
these activities  along with cash generated from operations  resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  as compared to december  the company s cash and cash equivalents at december  were million 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next year 
although the company believes that there has been some recent improvement in the demand for enterprise software solutions and increased market acceptance of its product  it cannot predict whether or when that market will soften or if market acceptance will change 
if the market or the market acceptance of its products change  the company cannot predict whether  and to what extent  the demand for its products will increase or decrease 
any decrease in demand for the company s products would likely result in decreased revenue which would  in turn  have a significant negative impact on the company s financial results because a significant portion of the company s operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
as a result  despite savings realized from the company s september restructuring  the company s costs for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative could continue to increase as a percentage of revenues  thereby negatively affecting the company s operating results 
the company s future revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number and size of sales transactions the company enters into with customers  the adequacy of provisions for losses  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenues from a large order may constitute a significant portion of the company s total revenues in a particular quarter  further exacerbating fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company has historically derived a majority of its total revenues from sales within the united states 
sales outside of the united states primarily in europe represented approximately  and of the company s total revenues in  and  respectively 
in  the company s gross profit on these sales approximated the gross profit on sales within the united states 
the company s european operations revenues decreased in due to a decrease in demand for the company s fax software 
the company will continue to leverage its accuroute base in europe  as well as its indirect channel relationships  to focus sales resources on the legal vertical market and expects that the european results will start to improve over the course of there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase international sales of its products and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s united kingdom subsidiary transacts business primarily in its local currency 
the company s united kingdom subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
significant currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company manages its foreign exchange exposure by monitoring its net monetary position using natural hedges of its assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that this policy will eliminate all currency exposure 
foreign currency exposure has not been material to the company s financial position or results of operations to date 
if the volume of the company s business denominated in foreign currencies increases  the company may be required to use derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company will continue to leverage its existing distribution channels  where appropriate  to broaden its reach to its target vertical markets and further penetrate its installed base 
the company is pursuing sales opportunities via its solution reseller channel  as well as focusing sales efforts on specific market segments  in order to facilitate product acceptance 
sales through the company s indirect distribution channels represented approximately  and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
the company s preparation of this form k required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the company s financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves 
the company derives its revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which includes software license and hardware revenue  and ii services and support revenue  which includes software maintenance and support  installation  training and consulting revenue 
the company licenses its software products on a perpetual basis 
the company generates revenue from licensing the rights to use its software products and sales of hardware directly to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the company s resellers order products from the company based on purchase orders received from end users and do not order stock 
the company s products are sold to resellers and directly to end users without any specifically stated rights of return 
occasionally  however  the company  in its sole discretion  will accept a product return if the end user finds that the product does not fit its needs 
the company also sells hardware products  which are provided by a third party  on a pass through basis  plus an additional mark up  to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the hardware products that are resold are not functional without the company s software 
to support its software products  the company sells software maintenance and support  installation  training and consulting services to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of multiple elements including software  hardware and service revenue 
the company applies the provisions of sfas statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  with respect to providing for potential future product returns 
as described below  management must make and use significant judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may have resulted in the amount and timing of the company s revenue if management had made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software products and hardware to both end users and resellers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products have been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
the company maintains a reserve for potential product returns 
software maintenance and support revenue is recognized over the term of the related maintenance period  which is typically a one year period though occasionally the company sells multiple year maintenance contracts  in which case the associated revenue is recognized over the multiple year term of the contract 
other services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision and acceptance is uncertain  then the company will defer all revenue until the customer accepts the products purchased 
acceptance in these instances generally occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision tied to determination that the company s product meets published specifications and there are no uncertainties with regard to the customer s acceptance  then the company will recognize revenue at the time of sale  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria previously mentioned have been met and the acceptance period is of short duration 
the company s transactions frequently involve the sale of software  hardware and related services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element under the residual method  in accordance with sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under this method  revenue is allocated first to all undelivered elements  such as services  based on the fair value of those elements  which is the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
the company s services are not essential to the functionality of the software  as these services do not alter the capabilities of the software and do not carry a significant degree of risk to perform 
the amount allocated to the delivered elements  such as software license and hardware revenue  is the difference between the total arrangement value and the amount allocated to the undelivered elements 
if the delivered elements include both software and hardware  the amount allocated to hardware revenue is based on the price charged to the company by the third party vendor plus an additional mark up  with the remainder allocated to software revenue 
to the extent that a discount is offered in the arrangement  the entire discount is allocated to the delivered element or elements 
if the delivered elements include hardware and software  the discount is allocated to the hardware and software based on their respective list prices 
for all sales  the company uses a binding purchase order  a signed contract or a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through the company s resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders  on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond the company s normal payment terms  which are thirty to sixty days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company reviews dunn bradstreet credit reports for all of its resellers and adjusts its credit limits with those resellers accordingly 
if a particular reseller does not have a favorable report or the company does not have enough credit information to determine if the reseller is credit worthy then the company predominantly sells to such resellers on cash on delivery terms 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
the company maintains reserves for potential product returns and makes adjustments to these reserves as needed based on historical product return rates  and considers the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand and acceptance of the company s products 
management s calculation of the estimated return reserve is based upon an account specific review of potential returns  where a return probability is known  and a general estimate based upon past historical returns as a percentage of revenue 
management must make and use significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may have resulted in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  management must make estimates of the company s ability to collect on its accounts receivable 
the company records trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount  these accounts do not bear interest 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis 
management s calculation of the estimated accounts receivable reserve is also based upon an account specific review of potential uncollectible accounts  where a bad debt probability is known  and a general estimate based upon past historical bad debts as a percentage of accounts receivable 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure to its customers 
the company s combined accounts receivable and returns reserve was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
both components of calculating the estimated reserve  specific identification and historic experience  are material judgments made by management 
management bases these judgments on historic trends  taking into consideration current business and economic conditions  which could change materially  thus changing the required reserve level materially 
the potential change could be positive  in the event the reserve estimate proves unnecessary  or negative  if the reserve proves inadequate 
the company s deferred revenue is comprised mainly of revenue that is deferred for software maintenance and support contracts 
the other components of deferred revenue are amounts from sales transactions that were deferred because they did not meet all of the provisions of the company s revenue recognition policy 
software development costs 
software development costs are considered for capitalization when technological feasibility is established in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company sells software in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product introductions and changing customer needs 
accordingly  the company has determined that it cannot determine technological feasibility until the development state of the product is nearly complete 
the time period during which cost could be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short and  consequently  the amounts that might be capitalized are not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
therefore  the company charges all software development costs to operations in the period incurred 
taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income and state sales taxes 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax obligations  while also assessing differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accrued state sales tax liabilities 
the company has deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accrued state sales tax liabilities included within its balance sheet 
the company assesses its deferred tax assets for each reporting period as to whether it is more likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income 
in making this assessment  the company includes assumptions regarding ongoing tax planning strategies 
to the extent the company believes that recovery is uncertain  the company must establish a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be recovered 
changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the company s statement of operations 
the company provides a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until it returns to an appropriate level of taxable income 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
if the company is successful in generating sufficient future taxable income  the company will reduce the valuation allowance through a reduction in income tax expense in the future 
the company estimates accrued state sales taxes for each reporting period based on tax rates in effect for the reporting periods in each of the states where the company has a potential nexus and for the time period during which the company has that nexus 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine this liability are subject to change as they are difficult to measure or value 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company s state sales taxes expense could be materially impacted

in conjunction with a corporate restructuring  several positions were eliminated during the third quarter of the decrease in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenue is primarily attributable to the decrease in overhead costs attributable to the decreased number of employees in the research and development department 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of total revenues for each respective period 
the decrease in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues is due to reductions in depreciation  consulting and professional fee expenses  combined with a decrease in accruals for state sales tax 
restructuring costs 
in the third quarter of  the company announced a restructuring of certain of its operations  and recorded a pretax charge of  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the charge included severance related costs associated with the workforce reduction  primarily in the company s domestic operations  and costs associated with closing of its oregon office 
the reduction in workforce consisted of three employees in the sales and marketing department  two employees performing general and administrative functions  three employees performing technical support services and five employees in the research and development department 
the following table summarizes the accrual and usage of the restructuring charges in lease severance total total charge    cash payments    ending balance  december    the total cash impact of the restructuring is  interest and other income 
interest and other income consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
also included in interest and other income for are amounts recognized from the sale of common stock of verso technologies  inc  verso as described below 
interest and other income was  for the fiscal year ended december  and  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease of is due to changes in principal balances and lower interest rates 
included in the interest and other income for fiscal year is  realized from the company s sale of common stock of verso as described below 
the remaining decline in interest and other income  net excluding the proceeds from the sale of verso stock is due to changes in principal balances of the company s cash and cash equivalents 
in april  the company purchased  shares of series b preferred stock preferred stock of 
comfax  inc which later changed its name to messageclick  inc messageclick a development stage company that developed and marketed internet based facsimile communications devices 
as part of the transaction  the company purchased a patent  us patent no 
 entitled method and apparatus for interfacing fax machines to digital communication networks from messageclick 
the company paid  for the preferred stock and the patent 
the company initially recorded its investment in messageclick at the total purchase price of  and placed no value on the patent 
the company has not used the patent 
at the end of each subsequent quarter  the company evaluated the carrying cost of this investment and adjusted the balance  if it was deemed appropriate  to what the company believed to be its realizable value 
in making this decision  the company reviewed the most recent messageclick financial statements that were made available to the company s management  had discussions with messageclick s management  and reviewed documents relating to subsequent rounds of financing received by messageclick 
based on the aforementioned  the company determined that as of december   the carrying value of the investment was  during each of the first  second and third quarters of fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of the investment by  during the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off the entire remaining carrying value of the investment 
the decision to write off the investment is described below 
on november   messageclick was acquired by verso  a company publicly traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol vrso 
the company received  shares of verso common stock  cash  which included cash the company was entitled to and cash in lieu of fractional shares of verso  and a warrant to purchase  shares of verso common stock in exchange for its  shares of preferred stock 
the  shares of verso common stock received by the company were unregistered and the company was restricted from selling these shares for twelve months from the date of the acquisition 
additionally  the company only had piggy back registration rights for those shares of verso common stock 
furthermore  the company potentially would receive an additional  shares of verso common stock if certain conditions of the purchase agreement were met 
at the time of the acquisition  verso was trading at per share and at december   verso was trading at resulting in a  value for the  shares 
additionally  as of march  prior to the date on which the company filed its form k for the year ended december   verso was trading at a share  thus providing a trading value as of march  of the company s investment of 
due to the rapid and significant decline in verso s common stock  the restriction on sale of the stock  the uncertainty of the ultimate realizability of the stock and the immateriality of the value of the shares  the company decided to write off the entire carrying value of  of the investment as of december  in  the company sold  of its verso common stock for approximately  and recorded the realized value in interest and other income at that time 
on july   the company received an additional  shares of verso common stock as certain conditions described in the purchase agreement were met 
the company sold those shares on september  for per share for total gross proceeds of  and recorded the realized value in interest and other income at that time 
the company does not expect to receive any additional shares of verso common stock 
the company s warrant to purchase  shares of verso common stock expires in november the fair value of the warrant is not material to the company s financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
during  the company recorded a  tax benefit resulted from a tax refund that its united kingdom subsidiary received during the first quarter of this subsidiary had incurred a loss for the fiscal year ended december  that resulted in an income tax benefit 
the tax benefit was carried back to prior years taxes paid and resulted in a tax refund 
because the subsidiary was undergoing an inland revenue audit for tax year  the realizability of this refund was not certain and therefore the company did not record the benefit on its books until the audit was cleared and the cash was received  both of which occurred in the first quarter of the company provided a tax provision of  for its united kingdom subsidiary based on the level of profitability that the subsidiary generated in the company recorded a provision of million against the valuation of its net deferred tax asset during the year ended december  sfas no 
requires a valuation allowance be recorded against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  the company incurred significant and previously unanticipated losses in the first half of fiscal year  and the then current outlook indicated that significant uncertainty would continue into the next fiscal year 
these cumulative losses  together with the company s prior losses  resulted in management s decision that it was more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets would not be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the company wrote off the remaining deferred tax asset of million in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  the private sales of preferred stock and the company s initial public offering of common stock completed in august at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s operating activities provided cash of  for the year ended december  and used cash of million for the year ended december  operating expenses were million lower in than they were in and overall cash increased by million 
management believes that the additional resources being allocated to improve the accuroute product s success in the legal vertical market plus the increase in general and administrative expenses associated with preparation for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations will put pressure on the company s earnings during but that its existing cash is sufficient for at least the next twelve months 
net cash provided during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a net profit from operations and the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization  along with a decrease to accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts receivable is due to management s increased focus on improving working capital by decreasing days sales outstanding 
the increase in deferred revenue is due to the fact that several customers purchased large software maintenance and support contracts during the fourth quarter of as a result of the company s focus on renewing existing customer maintenance agreements 
net cash provided was offset by decreases to the accounts receivable reserve  accrued state sales tax  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and an increase to inventory 
the decrease in the accounts receivable reserve is due to the release of reserves relating to specific accounts where the risk of a return is no longer considered to be present 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to the timing of vendor payments  which the company tries to manage in an effort to improve its cash balances 
the decrease to accrued state sales tax is due to the settlement of sales taxes with certain states during the year 
the company expects to continue to settle state sales taxes with other states in but cannot predict with any certainty the overall effect this might have on its cash position 
the decrease to accrued liabilities is due to a reduction in accrued professional fees 
the increase in inventory resulted from the company s efforts to ensure enough stock was on hand to ship any year end orders 
net cash used during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a net loss from operations and decreases to the accounts receivable reserve  accrued state sales tax  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
this was offset by the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization  along with decreases to accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and inventory and an increase in accrued restructuring 
investing activities used cash of  and provided cash of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in was for the purchases of property and equipment  offset by the decrease in other assets 
property and equipment purchases were predominately of computer related software and hardware products 
cash proceeds in were from the sale of short term investments offset by the purchases of short term investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the company does not currently anticipate any significant changes to its level and purpose of cash used in investing activities in financing activities provided cash of million and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in consists of proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and financing from a private placement of common stock  further described below 
on march   the company completed the sale of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  in a private placement to institutional and other accredited investors 
the company intends to use the proceeds of the private placement  which totaled million  for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the proceeds received as a result of the march transaction were offset by a cash usage of million  as the company repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock from asa international ltd  an existing shareholder  in a private transaction at a price of per share 
the shares were purchased with generally available corporate funds and will be held in treasury 
cash provided by financing activities in consists of proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock for stock option exercises 
based on its fourth quarter performance and current expectations  the company believes that the cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will satisfy its working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with its operations through at least the next twelve months 
the company expects that principal uses of cash will be for operations  working capital  payment of sales taxes and purchases of property and equipment 
management currently has no plan to obtain additional financing during if the company were to seek additional financing  there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the following table represents the approximate amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total obligations    operating lease requirements consist mainly of lease payments for the company s offices in salem  new hampshire and london  england see item  properties  of this form k for more information regarding the company s lease obligations

certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the discussion below highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results 
information provided by the company from time to time including statements in this form k that are not historical facts are so called forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in particular  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning the plans and objectives of management  expectations for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  developments relating to the company s product and service offerings  markets and acquisitions  anticipated trends in the company s business  the company s strategic alliances  changes in the regulatory environment  the company s expected liquidity and capital resources and the company s critical accounting policies may constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees  but are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations set forth in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause these kind of differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the other risks discussed from time to time in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
future operating results uncertain 
the company incorporated and shipped its initial facsimile software products in although the company recorded an operating profit in the year ended december   the company had operating losses and decreasing revenues in the years ending december  and the company introduced accuroute in the second quarter of and accuroute represented of software revenues in there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its level of revenues or maintain its profitability in the future  as the company s operating history makes the accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
increases in operating expenses may occur and  together with pricing pressures and any decline in the growth rate of the overall us economy or the company s industry  may result in a decrease in operating income and operating margin percentage 
the company s ability to improve its operating results will depend upon  among other things  its ability to increase sales of the accuroute  genifax and genidocs software products to new customers  as well as its ability to increase product penetration into existing customers 
the company recently commenced its strategic expansion into document routing and distribution software and has limited financial and operating data and a limited operating history relevant to this solution 
accordingly  it is difficult to evaluate the prospects for the level of acceptance of this solution 
future operating results will depend on many other factors  including  without limitation  the degree and rate of growth of the markets in which the company competes  the level of acceptance of the windows nt  windows and windows xp operating systems  the level of product and price competition  the ability of the company to establish strategic relationships and develop and market new and enhanced products  the company s ability to control costs  the ability of the company to expand its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels both domestically and internationally  and the ability of the company to attract and retain key personnel 
as a result  it is possible that in the future  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
product concentration 
to date  much of the company s revenues have been attributable to licenses of the company s facsimile based enterprise solutions and related products and services 
the company expects these products and related services to continue to account for significant amounts of the company s future revenues 
however  recently the amount of revenues attributable to the licenses of these products has declined and there can be no assurances that this decline will not continue 
furthermore  the company introduced its secure business to business electronic document exchange products  genidocs and genifax  to the market in the fourth quarter of and it introduced its proprietary document and routing software  accuroute  in the second quarter of the company has only recently begun to recognize a significant amount of revenues from its accuroute product 
the company expects that this product may account for an increasing portion of future revenues 
however  there can be no assurances that the accuroute product will be financially successful or result in any significant revenues in the future 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for this product  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of the company s products are concentrated in the electronic document exchange market and  therefore  any factors affecting demand for these sorts of solutions could cause the company s operating results to decline 
investors must evaluate the company s prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies dependent upon operating revenues from a new product line in an emerging and rapidly evolving market 
new products and technological change 
the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements on a timely basis  or that new products or product enhancements developed by the company  such as the accuroute  genidocs and genifax products will achieve market acceptance 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
from time to time  the company and its competitors may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of new product offerings by the company or its competitors will not cause customers to defer or forego the licensing of the company s existing or planned products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
market risks for secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
the market for genidocs  the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution is new and evolving rapidly 
the company s success will depend upon the extent and timing of adoption and use by current and potential customers of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
the company s success will also depend upon acceptance of its technology as the standard for providing these solutions 
the adoption and use of the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally exchanged information 
the company s ability to influence usage of its secure business to business electronic document exchange solution by customers is limited 
the company intends to spend resources educating potential customers about the value of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
it is difficult to assess or to predict with any assurance the present and future size of the potential market for the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution  or the growth rate  if any  for this market 
moreover  the company cannot predict whether the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution will achieve any market acceptance 
sales of genidocs were lower in than they were in any future products or future product enhancements that are not favorably received by customers may not be profitable and could therefore damage the company s reputation or brand name 
dependence on genifax product line and the windows xp environment 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its revenues from licenses of the genifax product and related services and resale of related hardware 
continued market acceptance of the genifax product is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  any decline in demand for or failure to maintain broad market acceptance of the genifax product line as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on new and enhanced versions of the genifax product 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing the genifax product or any new or enhanced versions of the genifax product 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing products for new or enhanced operating systems such as windows or windows xp  or that these systems will not obviate the need for the company s products 
if any new or enhanced operating system gains widespread use and the company fails to develop and provide its products for this operating system on a timely basis  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
sales of genifax were lower in than they were in dependence on accuroute product line 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its revenues from licenses of the accuroute product and related services 
continued market acceptance of the accuroute product is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  any decline in demand for or failure to maintain broad market acceptance of the accuroute product line as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on new and enhanced versions of the accuroute product 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing the accuroute product or any new or enhanced versions of the accuroute product 
sales of accuroute were higher in than they were in dependence on client server environment 
the company s enterprise  client server facsimile software products are intended to help organizations efficiently manage their facsimile communications  utilizing a client server computing environment 
there can be no assurance that organizations will move away from the use of stand alone fax machines or continue to adopt client server environments  or that customers of the company that have begun the migration to a client server environment will broadly implement this model of computing 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the market for client server applications  which in turn will depend in part on the growth in the number of organizations implementing client server computing environments 
there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow or that the company will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of these markets 
if the market for client server application products and services does not grow in the future  grows more slowly than the company anticipates  or if the company fails to respond effectively to evolving requirements of this market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in august  the nasdaq national market nasdaq informed the company that its common stock had traded for consecutive trading days below nasdaq s minimum bid price and that the company had until november   to demonstrate compliance with nasdaq s listing requirements by maintaining a bid price for its common stock of at least for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
the company did not regain compliance and on october   the company applied to transfer from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
on november   the company transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market and it was afforded the remainder of this market s calendar day grace period  or until february   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price per share requirement 
on january   omtool s board of directors and stockholders  at a special meeting  approved an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation to effect a one for seven reverse stock split 
on february   the company was notified by nasdaq that it had regained compliance with nasdaq s listing standards 
in addition  the company cannot predict its ability to maintain its listing in the future on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the delisting of the company s common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market may materially impair stockholders ability to buy and sell shares of the company s common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  the company s common stock 
furthermore  the delisting of the company s common stock could significantly impair the company s ability to raise capital should it desire to do so in the future 
intense competition 
in the distributed document capture and delivery market where the accuroute software competes  the company is likely to see competitive products being offered by hardware vendors such as xerox  canon  ricoh  lexmark and others 
in some cases these products are the result of partnerships with us based software companies 
the company also expects competition in this market from a number of independent software vendors whose business focus was initially the high volume production scanning segment such as kofax and captiva  or forms management and process routing companies such as cardiff 
e copy  a former omtool business partner  has formed a relationship with canon and has embedded their document capture and routing capabilities into the front panel of the canon imagerunner multifunction printer mfp device 
other potential software competitors include scansoft  as well as the document management vendors like hummingbird and interwoven imanage who are seeking to develop  either through partnerships or internal resources  scan to archive capabilities using standard e mail as the transport  and a generic document profile as a means of entering the content into their repository 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully in the distributed document capture and delivery market depends upon a number of factors both within and beyond its control including product performance  reliability and features  ease of use  product scalability  quality of support services  price performance  timeliness of enhancements and new product releases by the company and its competitors 
the company expects this market to mature and become increasingly competitive with success resulting from the formation of critical partnerships and alliances with both selected hardware and software partners 
the market for client server computer based facsimile solutions is also competitive and is more established and mature than the markets in which the accuroute and genidocs products compete 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully in the fax market depends upon a number of factors both within and beyond its control including product performance  reliability and features  ease of use  product scalability  quality of support services  price performance  timeliness of enhancements and new product releases by the company and its competitors 
given these factors  the company believes that in order to be successful  it must continue its focus on delivering a core  modular and scalable product on one of the most prolific system platforms  windows  with features that appeal to the broadest segment of the electronic document exchange market  which includes fax and all of the other document control and management features that omtool offers 
the company competes directly with a number of vendors of facsimile products  including providers of facsimile software products for client server networks such as captaris rightfax  dicom topcall and biscom 
the company also competes with providers offering a range of alternative facsimile solutions including outsourcing network facsimile solutions  such as easylink services and xpedite  operating systems containing facsimile and document e mail features  low end fax modem products  providers of desktop fax software  single platform facsimile software products  and customized proprietary software solutions 
in addition  providers of operating systems or business software applications may bundle competitive facsimile solutions as part of their broader product offerings 
in the intensely competitive and rapidly changing business to business secure document exchange market  the company competes directly with authentica  sigaba  tumbleweed  and zixit and a number of other providers 
there are also other categories of technology solutions that overlap and compete in certain ways with aspects of the company s products 
these include document management solutions from vendors such as emc documentum  hummingbird and interwoven imanage whose electronic collaboration solutions compete with certain aspects of the company s solutions  electronic forms and electronic signature solutions from vendors such as adobe  pureedge  silanis that offer the creation of electronic documents with electronic signatures  and security infrastructure solutions from vendors such as verisign and entrust whose solutions can be used to build applications that enable secure document communications 
the company expects the competition in the business to business secure document exchange market to increase over time 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and market acceptance of their products and technologies than the company 
in addition  there are relatively low barriers to entry in the markets in which the company operates and intends to operate  and new competition may arise either from expansion by established companies or from new emerging companies or from resellers of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that current or potential competitors of the company will not develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by the company 
further  the company s competitors may adapt more quickly than the company to new or emerging technologies and changes in market opportunities or customer requirements  establish alliances with industry leaders  or take advantage of acquisition opportunities more readily than the company 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company will not be required to make substantial additional investments in connection with its research  development  engineering  marketing  sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat  or that those required investments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating margins 
changes in governing laws and regulations may also affect the company s ability to remain competitive 
increased competition may result in reduction in market share  pressure for price reductions and related reductions in gross margins  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its financial and business goals 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations  seasonality 
the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
causes of these fluctuations have included and may include  among others  the demand for the company s products and services  the size and timing of orders  the number  timing and significance of new product announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce  market and ship new and enhanced versions of the company s current and planned products on a timely basis  the level of product and price competition  changes in operating expenses  changes in average selling prices and mix of the company s products  changes in the company s sales incentive strategy  the mix of direct and indirect sales  and general economic factors  including factors affecting the overall us economy and the demand for enterprise information technology solutions 
in addition  the sale of the company s products often involves delays because customers tend to implement the products on a large scale  requiring them first to establish certain minimum hardware capabilities 
the company s products therefore often have a lengthy sales cycle while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for the purchase of the company s products 
during these sales cycles  the company may expend substantial funds and management efforts  yet receive no revenues 
it is difficult to accurately predict the sales cycle of any large order 
if one or more large orders fail to close as forecasted in a fiscal quarter  the company s revenues and operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely affected 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the potential occurrence of any one or more of these factors makes the prediction of revenues and results of operations on a quarterly basis difficult and performance forecasts derived from these predictions unreliable 
in addition  the company may invest in research and development and marketing expenses in order to promote further its products within vertical markets 
these investments would be required in advance of related market acceptance and revenue and  accordingly  any failure of the company s products to achieve planned levels of acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in general  revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for secure business to business electronic document exchange  enterprise client server facsimile solutions software and routing and distribution software is evolving rapidly and the company s sales cycle from the customer s initial evaluation through purchase of licenses and the related support services varies substantially from customer to customer 
license fee revenues in any quarter depend on orders received and shipped in that quarter with a significant percentage of orders in any quarter being received in the last weeks of the quarter 
license fee revenues from quarter to quarter are difficult to forecast  as no significant order backlog exists at the end of any quarter because the company s products typically are shipped upon receipt of customers orders 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expense is related to personnel  facilities  equipment and marketing programs 
the level of spending for these expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is therefore fixed in the short term 
the company s expense levels for personnel  facilities  equipment and marketing programs are based  in significant part  on the company s expectations of future revenues on a quarterly basis 
if actual revenue levels on a quarterly basis are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected by a similar amount because a relatively small amount of the company s expense varies with its revenue in the short term 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future periods the company s results of operations will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
expansion of indirect channels  potential for channel conflict  strategic alliances 
the company markets its products and services directly through telesales and indirectly through marketing channels such as value added resellers vars  systems integrators  distributors and strategic business partners 
although the company has historically focused its efforts on marketing through its sales force  the company continues to utilize resources to develop and expand indirect marketing channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified vars  systems integrators  distributors and strategic business partners  or that those third parties will successfully market the company s products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s resellers and strategic business partners will not develop  acquire or market computer based electronic document exchange  document routing and distribution and facsimile products that are competitive with the company s products 
the failure to retain its vars  systems integrators  distributors and strategic partners could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the distributor agreements governing the company s relationships generally provide that either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon days written notice to the other party 
the company also resells its products on a purchase order basis through other vars  systems integrators and distributors 
generally  in those situations  either party may terminate the relationship at any time  and therefore there can be no assurance that any var  systems integrator or distributor will continue to represent and sell the company s products 
furthermore  the company s strategic alliances generally may be terminated by either party  at any time  there can therefore be no assurances that these strategic alliances will continue 
the inability to retain certain vars  systems integrators  distributors or strategic business partners  or the development or marketing by vars  systems integrators  distributors or strategic business partners of competitive offerings  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
selling through indirect channels may limit the company s contacts with its customers 
as a result  the company s ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
the company s strategy of marketing its products directly to end users and indirectly through vars  systems integrators and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
the company s direct sales efforts may compete with those of its indirect channels and  to the extent different resellers target the same customers  resellers may also come into conflict with each other 
as the company strives to expand its indirect distribution channels  there can be no assurance that emerging channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect its relationships with existing vars  systems integrators or distributors or adversely affect its ability to attract new vars  systems integrators and distributors 
risks associated with international expansion 
an element of the company s strategy is to increase its international sales 
the company expects to face competition from secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions and local facsimile product providers in their native countries 
to successfully maintain international sales  the company needs to recruit and retain additional international resellers and distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain international sales of its products or that the company s international distribution channels will be able to adequately market  service and support the company s products 
international operations generally are subject to certain risks  including dependence on independent resellers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic conditions and changing restrictions imposed by united states export laws 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company currently has a sales office outside of the united states 
the company s non united states presence subjects the company to certain additional risks including difficulties in staffing and managing these foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  a majority of the company s sales have been made in united states dollars and the company has not engaged in any hedging transactions through the purchase of derivative securities or otherwise 
the company s united kingdom subsidiary transacts business primarily in its local currency 
the company s united kingdom subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
significant currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
ability to obtain additional financing 
the company expects that its current cash  cash equivalents and investments will meet its normal working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company may  however  need to raise additional funding at that time or earlier if it decides to undertake more rapid expansion  including acquisitions of complementary products or technologies  or if it increases its marketing and or research and development efforts in order to respond to competitive pressures 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
the company may obtain additional financing by issuing shares of its common stock  which could dilute its existing stockholders 
if the company cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  it may not be able to develop or enhance its products or respond appropriately to competitive pressures  which would seriously harm its business 
risks associated with acquisitions 
the company may augment its internal growth with acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand the company s business 
certain of these businesses may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
in order to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions  the company must successfully integrate the acquired businesses with its existing operations and no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in this regard 
the company has limited experience in integrating acquired companies into its operations  in expanding the scope of operations of required businesses  in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating internationally 
in the past the company has incurred one time costs and expenses in connection with acquisitions and it is likely that similar one time costs and expenses would be incurred in connection with future acquisitions 
in addition  the company may be required to amortize significant intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions  which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
further  attractive acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the possible need to obtain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete future acquisitions 
in order to finance such acquisitions  it may be necessary for the company to raise additional funds either through public or private financings  including bank borrowings 
any financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to the company 
the company may also issue shares of its common stock to acquire attractive businesses  which may dilute the company s existing stockholders 
ability to manage growth 
the company may expand its operations as it anticipates that expansion may be required in order to address potential market opportunities 
the company may also increase the size of its sales and marketing and research and development expenditures as necessary 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to complete this expansion successfully or that the expansion would generate sufficient revenues to cover the company s expenses 
the company will need to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or continue to hire this kind of personnel in the future 
the inability of the company to effectively expand operations and manage growth  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
internal controls over financial reporting 
pursuant to the requirements of sarbanes oxley  the company must maintain and enhance its internal controls over financial reporting 
presently  the company is not an accelerated filer as that term is defined in the securities act 
if the company were to become an accelerated filer for the fiscal year ending on december   then commencing with the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   management of the company will be required to deliver a report regarding its determination of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
further  under section of sarbanes oxley  the company s independent registered public accounting firm will be required to deliver an attestation report regarding management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
if the company is not an accelerated filer as of the end of fiscal year ending on december   then management of the company and the company s independent registered public accounting firm will have to comply with these requirements commencing with the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december  as a result  during the fiscal years ending december  and  the company s management will expend considerable time  attention and resources to determining the strength and effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and  where appropriate  making improvements 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent all errors and intentional misrepresentations 
any system of internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all control objectives have been and will continue to be met 
some of the potential risks involved could include  without limitation  management judgments  simple errors or mistakes  willful misconduct regarding controls or misinterpretation 
though the company believes that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are effective  there can be no guarantee that existing controls and procedures will prevent or detect all material issues  errors or intentional misrepresentations 
further  the company s existing controls may not be effective in future situations 
any failure of the company s disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
management s assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses in the company s internal controls over financial reporting that the company needs to remedy or may raise other issues of concern for investors in the company 
should management determine that a material weakness exists in the company s internal controls over financial reporting  the price of the company s common stock might decline 
risk associated with sole hardware supplier 
the company currently purchases hardware products for sale to its customers from a single third party supplier 
the company does not have a long term  fixed price or minimum volume contract with this supplier 
instead  the company orders hardware equipment through purchase orders from time to time 
the company does not carry significant inventories of these hardware products and does not have a guaranteed supply arrangement with this supplier 
although the company believes that it could secure these hardware products from alternative suppliers  in the event of a disruption of supply from this sole supplier  the company might not be able to develop an alternative source in a timely manner or at favorable prices 
even if the company were able to purchase these hardware components from alternative sources  the company would have little control over the costs of these products 
were the company forced to pay significantly higher prices for these hardware products  it might limit the mark up over the price paid by the company that it can reasonably charge its customers 
were the company unable to provide this hardware to its customers  forcing its customers to buy this hardware directly from third parties  or were the company forced to decrease the size of its mark up  the company s hardware and total revenues would be negatively impacted 
risks associated with expiration of lease for headquarters space 
the company leases office space  used as its headquarters and primary business location  at a industrial way in salem  new hampshire 
the company s current lease terminates on december  as a result  the company has engaged a real estate agent to assist the company in considering its options 
at this time  the company has not determined whether it will be able to renew its lease at its present location on sufficiently favorable terms or whether it will instead lease a new facility and relocate the company 
the process of evaluating options and negotiating a new or renewed lease will require time and attention from members of the company s management 
further  if the company elects to relocate its operations to a new location  the company will incur related expenses and will encounter disruption of operations related to the move  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
risks associated with the use of arthur andersen as independent auditors 
arthur andersen llp andersen  the company s former independent public accountants that audited the company s financial statements until june   was found guilty by a jury on june  of federal obstruction of justice in connection with the government s investigation of enron corporation 
andersen ceased practicing before the sec effective august  although the company has no reason to believe that the financial statements audited by andersen are incorrect  it is possible that events arising out of the indictment may adversely affect andersen s ability to satisfy any claims arising from its provision of auditing and other services to the company  including claims that may arise out of andersen s audit of the company s financial statements 
the sec has indicated that it will continue accepting financial statements audited or reviewed by andersen provided that the company comply with the applicable rules and orders issued by the sec in march for that purpose 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  most of whom are not bound by employment agreements or noncompetition agreements 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for this highly qualified personnel is intense and the company has historically experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or continue to hire key technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required 
all of the company s investments consist of money market funds and commercial paper that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s current investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its united kingdom subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in the united kingdom subsidiary s local currency 
the united kingdom subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the year ended december   however  significant currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
