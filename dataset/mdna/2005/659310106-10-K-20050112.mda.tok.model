item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the operating companies  subsidiaries of exxonmobil corp 
and the royal dutch shell group  pay monthly royalties to the trust based on their sales of natural gas  sulfur and oil 
the oldenburg concession is the primary area from which these products are extracted and provides nearly of all the royalties received by the trust 
of these three products  natural gas provides approximately of the total royalties 
the gas is sold to various distributors under long term contracts which delineate  among other provisions  the timing  manner  volume and price of the gas sold 
the pricing mechanisms contained in these contracts include a delay factor of three to six months and use the price of light heating oil in germany as one of the primary pricing components 
since germany must import a large percentage of its energy requirements  the us dollar price of oil on the international market has a significant  although delayed  impact on the price of gas 
a strong euro would tend to reduce the cost of oil being imported into germany and likely result in a lower price for light heating oil and a reduction in the amount of royalties paid to the trust in germany 
however  a strong euro would also result in an increase in the amount of royalties received when the royalties  originally received in euros  are converted into dollars and transferred to the trust s bank account in the us a weak euro would have the opposite effect 
however  it is important to note that the prices of imported oil and the euro dollar relationship are only two of the numerous factors that can affect the price of light heating oil 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee  the managing director and the audit committee chairman  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see note to financial statements in item of this report 
the trust has no means of ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which with sales volumes form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received by the trust upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
results fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income decreased from  to  the decline in gas sales and the drop in gas prices combined to push royalty income lower 
the increase in the average value of the euro contributed to the drop in gas prices but helped offset the decline in royalties by increasing the amount of dollars received when the royalties were transferred to the us under the higher royalty rate agreement with mobil erdgas covering western oldenburg  gas sales declined from billion cubic feet bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal in comparison to the prior year s equivalent quarter  each quarter showed a decline 
with the exception of the first quarter of fiscal  gas sales for each quarter showed a drop from those of the immediately preceding quarter 
the drop in reservoir pressure that continued throughout the year was not fully addressed until the month of october when the new compressors came fully on line and even now there remains some minor construction work before the full production rate is reached 
average gas prices for gas sold from this royalty area declined from euro cents per kilowatt hour ecents kwh in fiscal to ecents kwh in fiscal under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb covering the entire oldenburg concession  gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal the overall gas sales showed the same pattern as gas sales from western oldenburg in comparison to the prior year and the immediately preceding quarter 
average gas prices for gas sold from this royalty area declined from ecents kwh in fiscal to ecents kwh in fiscal the euro continued its strong performance against the dollar throughout fiscal and in late november reached its highest point yet at a dollar equivalent value of 
using the cumulative transfer of royalties from germany to the us to generate an average value for the euro  there was an increase in the average value from for fiscal to for fiscal the consultant with whom the trust has recently established a relationship continues to work diligently to develop the contacts with the personnel from the two operating companies to provide the best information possible to the trust and its unit owners 
however  the formation by the operating companies of the unified exploration and production venture  empg  has resulted in an information flow that is much more restricted than that experienced in prior years 
interest income for fiscal was lower due to the low interest rates that remained in effect and the reduced funds available for investment 
trust expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the absence of expenses associated with the biennial examination of the operating companies in germany to confirm the accuracy of the royalty payments resulted in the lower level of expenses 
the operating companies have been involved in a construction and drilling program throughout in an effort to increase gas production and sales 
the two new compressor units completed a four week testing period at the end of september  and since then have been in full operation 
while some construction work involving some dehydration plants remains to be completed  as of the beginning of october  the compressor units have produced at a rate of million cubic feet per day ft d 
when all construction is completed  this production figure is expected to rise to million ft d 
the operating companies have pursued an expanded drilling program during kneheim z  a production well located in western oldenburg  began production in mid september 
hemmelte z a  a horizontal deviation off an existing western production well  began production in mid october 
the deviation presented particular difficulties that were successfully addressed 
goldenstedt z a  a horizontal deviation off an existing production well in eastern oldenburg  has been completed 
using a high tech geo steering procedure the operators were able to extend the horizontal deviation approximately  feet in length 
the start of production is scheduled for march sage z  an exploratory well located in eastern oldenburg  has been completed 
preliminary indications are that this well may have tapped a separate geological block but final confirmation will not be possible until the second half of construction of a new gas treatment plant and a field pipeline will be necessary before production can begin 
this additional construction will delay the start of production until at least september of the operating companies have indicated that they will continue their expanded drilling program into with four additional wells planned 
two horizontal deviations off existing wells are planned 
the eastern well  goldenstedt z a  will begin drilling in mid december and the western well  hemmelte z a  will begin drilling in april a new production well in eastern oldenburg  oythe z  to replace an existing well that suffered a casing collapse  is scheduled for a drilling start in september a new exploratory well in eastern oldenburg  doetlingen ost z  is scheduled for a drilling start in june this well is targeted to test a new geological reservoir 
results fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income increased from  to  the strengthening of world oil prices along with the gradual  albeit minor  improvement in the european economy combined to increase the amount of royalties paid to the trust 
additionally  the euro continued its climb throughout the first three quarters before falling back slightly in the final quarter of fiscal under the higher royalty rate agreement with mobil erdgas  the average quarterly gas price for the and fiscal years fell to its low point of cents kwh during the first quarter of fiscal from that point  the average quarterly price increased on a quarter over quarter basis for the next two quarters before falling back slightly in the final quarter 
for the entire fiscal year the average gas price fell by from ecents kwh for fiscal to ecents kwh for fiscal under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb  the average quarterly gas price for the and fiscal years fell to its low point of ecents kwh during the fourth quarter of fiscal with the exception of the third quarter the average quarterly gas price posted a decline over the gas prices for the prior year s equivalent period 
for the entire fiscal year the average gas price fell by from ecents kwh for fiscal to ecents kwh for fiscal except for a minor drop off during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the value of the euro increased steadily during the and fiscal years 
using the transfer of royalties from germany to the us to provide an average value for the euro  the value of the euro during fiscal increased from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal the value of the euro continued its almost uninterrupted rise posting average values of  and in the first through third quarters before falling back slightly to in the fourth quarter 
for fiscal the decline in gas production and sales was concentrated in the western half of the oldenburg concession 
in each quarter western gas sales posted a year over year decline 
in total for the year western oldenburg gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal eastern gas sales increased from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal overall gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal interest income for fiscal was lower due to the historically low interest rates in effect 
trust expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the combination of a reduction in trust expenses in fiscal resulting from the reimbursement by the new york stock exchange for expenses associated with the trust s symbol change from net to nrt and higher legal and audit expenses in fiscal that were associated with the additional requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of resulted in the substantial increase in fiscal critical accounting policies the financial statements  appearing subsequently in this report  present financial statement balances and financial results on a cash basis of accounting  which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap basis 
cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty trusts such as the trust 
cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid 
gaap basis financial statements disclose income as earned and expenses as incurred  without regard to receipts or payments 
the sole exception to the use of the cash basis of accounting is the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners those distributions approved by the trustees for the trust 
the trust s distributable income represents royalty income received by the trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the trust  all on a cash basis 
in the opinion of the trustees  the use of the cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of operations of the trust and presents to the unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for tax reporting purposes 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning business  financial performance and financial condition of the trust 
many of these statements are based on information provided to the trust by the operating companies or by consultants using public information sources 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
these include uncertainties concerning levels of gas production and gas sale prices  general economic conditions and currency exchange rates 
actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust does not engage in any trading activities with respect to possible foreign exchange fluctuations 
the trust does not use any financial instruments to hedge against possible risks related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the market risk is negligible because standing instructions at its german bank require the bank to process transfers of royalty payments as soon as possible following their receipt
