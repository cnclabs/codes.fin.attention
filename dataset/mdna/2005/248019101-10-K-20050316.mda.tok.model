on june   we acquired new england business service  inc nebs 
nebs is a leading provider of products and services to small businesses 
accordingly  our consolidated results of operations include the results of nebs from the acquisition date 
we believe nebs is a strategic fit  as we both serve small business customers  and the acquisition expands our product offerings  customer base and non check revenue

share repurchases were suspended during the second quarter of  as we utilized our resources to complete the acquisition of nebs 
total assets increased by million in we acquired million of assets with the nebs acquisition 
long term debt increased million in  primarily because we issued notes to finance the acquisition of nebs 
shareholder s deficit decreased by million in  primarily because we generated net income of million which was partially offset by cash dividends of million 
consolidated overview following the acquisition of nebs  we re defined our business segments to include the following small business services  financial services and direct checks 
small business services is comprised of the newly acquired nebs business and our former business services segment 
this segment sells checks  forms and related products to more than six million small businesses and home offices through direct response marketing  financial institution referrals  independent distributors  sales representatives and the internet 
financial services sells personal and business checks  related products and check merchandising services to approximately  financial institution clients nationwide  including banks  credit unions and financial services companies 
direct checks is the nation s leading direct to consumer check supplier  selling under the checks unlimited and designer checks brands 
through these two brands  direct checks sells personal and business checks  as well as related products  using direct response marketing and the internet 
we operate only in north america 
although we are not in a high growth industry  we continue to generate strong cash flows 
we generated operating cash flows of million during and million during we believe our stable cash flows and our focus on cost management and operational excellence will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the check printing portion of the payments industry and to expand our presence in the small business arena 
our strong cash flows enabled us to realize the debt capacity needed to complete the nebs acquisition during the second quarter of we have also utilized our debt capacity to repurchase common shares over the past several years 
during and  we repurchased million shares for a total of million 
we have continued to pay dividends at an annual rate of per share  resulting in a dividend yield of based on our december  closing stock price 
during the first quarter of  we increased our quarterly dividend to per share  up per share from our previous dividend level 
we were able to increase the dividend for two reasons synergies realized from the nebs integration are exceeding our expectations  and we expect year over year growth from our small business services segment to offset declines in our core check businesses beginning in we believe we have sufficient financial resources to pursue additional acquisitions that leverage our core competencies and are accretive to earnings and cash flow  to strengthen our leading position in the markets in which we compete and to expand into closely related or adjacent products and services 
major challenges in our business are as follows 
two of our largest product groups  checks and business forms  are mature products and their use has been declining in the marketplace 
according to our estimates  the total number of personal  business and government checks written in the united states has been in decline since the mid s as a result of alternative payment methods such as debit cards  smart cards  electronic and other bill paying services and internet based payment services 
because check usage is declining  we have also been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
our relationships with specific financial institutions are usually formalized through supply contracts averaging three to five years in duration 
as we compete with other check printing companies to retain and obtain business in the face of declining volume  the resulting pricing pressure has reduced our profit margins  and we expect this trend to continue 
a federal reserve study reported that the check is still americans largest single non cash payment type  accounting for approximately of all non cash payments 
this is  however  a decrease from the previous federal reserve study published in which reported that checks comprised approximately of all non cash payments 
the report does note that this measure excludes checks written which are converted into electronic transactions at the point of sale 
the federal reserve study also indicated that consumer checks are declining faster than business checks 
this study was completed prior to the implementation of check legislation in october this banking legislation became effective on october and affects how checks can be processed 
the new law states that an electronic or paper reproduction of a check is the legal equivalent of the original check 
this permits financial institutions to submit these substitute checks for processing and clearing 
we believe this legislation supports the use of checks by creating a more efficient processing system which is less costly and will allow financial institutions to detect fraud earlier 
it remains to be seen what  if any  impact this legislation will have on consumers use of checks 
business forms products have also reached maturity 
continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  the price and performance capabilities of personal computers and related printers now provide a cost effective means to print low quality versions of business forms on plain paper 
additionally  electronic transaction systems and off the shelf business software applications have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by business forms products 
our direct checks segment and portions of our small business services segment have been impacted by reduced customer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
we believe that the decline in customer response rates is attributable to the decline in check usage  the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms products and an overall increase in direct mail solicitations received by our target customers 
because each advertisement is resulting in fewer new customers  the cost to acquire each new customer has increased 
we have also been impacted by a lengthening of the check reorder cycle due to the decline in check usage and the multi box promotional strategies which are standard practice for direct mail sellers of checks 
to offset these challenges  we have focused on increasing revenue per order by improving our selling techniques  as well as introducing new product offerings 
in small business services  we have provided extensive training to our sales associates to transition that organization from a service to a selling environment 
we have also partnered with our financial institution clients to increase the use of our financial institution referral program 
under this program  our financial institution clients refer their small business customers to us at the time of new account opening 
this allows us direct interaction with the small business customer 
additionally  through the nebs acquisition  we now have more products we can offer small business customers  and we have more channels through which to serve them 
in financial services  we have implemented the deluxeselect sm program 
this program allows us to interact directly with the customers of financial institutions and to leverage our extensive market research and knowledge of consumer behaviors and preferences 
as of december   approximately  financial institutions have enrolled in deluxeselect 
our financial services segment intends to target financial institution clients that understand the value we provide 
we provide high quality products  superior service  enhanced customer satisfaction and the check program management skills that lead to improved revenue and profitability for financial institutions 
in direct checks  we have encouraged consumers to place their orders by phone  where our sales associates have the opportunity to interact with the consumer 
typically  phone orders result in higher revenue per order than other order channels 
during the fourth quarter of  of first time customers placed their orders via the telephone  as compared to in all of these efforts have led to increased sales of premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added products and services such as fraud prevention and express delivery 
we continue to focus on cost management and operational excellence 
in  we closed six printing facilities 
we have also implemented other employee reductions over the past year and have announced our intention to close two additional printing facilities 
the application of lean principles in our manufacturing area has resulted in increased efficiencies  and we are applying these principles throughout the rest of the company 
we continue to closely manage spending and seek additional cost saving opportunities wherever possible 
additionally  in integrating nebs  we plan to realize cost synergies of at least million annually beginning in these synergies represent reduced costs in relation to nebs historical results of operations 
we expect to realize these synergies through eliminating redundancies  leveraging our shared services environment and enhancing productivity by implementing lean principles and sharing best practices 
recent economic indicators have been promising  and our results were not impacted by economic conditions as they were in an important measure for our small business services segment is small business confidence 
all trends in this area are positive 
the national federation of independent business nfib reported that small business sales levels  employment and capital spending are all trending upwards  as is the nfib s measure of small business optimism 
our financial services and direct checks segments are primarily impacted by consumer spending and employment levels 
consumer spending began improving in the second half of and continued to improve through additionally  the employment growth that began in the first quarter of continued through the end of the year  with an average of  jobs created per month in there is a correlation between employment and the rate at which consumers open checking accounts 
thus  the employment rate is a key factor for the check printing portion of the payments industry 
our early outlook indicates that on a total company basis  the economy will have a neutral impact on our business in one of our main focuses during will be the continued integration of nebs 
small business services provides one of the most comprehensive product and service offerings for small businesses 
this provides the basis for us to increase sales to existing customers  as well as to pursue new customers 
the nebs acquisition also provides a positive impact on our product mix by increasing our non check revenue 
based on the success of the integration thus far  we expect that we will realize both the cost synergies and growth we expected when we acquired nebs 
we anticipate that growth in our small business services segment will offset the decline in our core check businesses as we move into restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments over the past three years  we have recorded charges and credits for restructurings  asset impairments and other developments 
the significant items disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report are as follows dollars in thousands net restructuring charges    change in accounting for inventory  asset impairment losses  post retirement benefit curtailment gain  net pre tax charges    reversal of income tax contingencies   deferred income tax valuation allowance  net credits to provision for income taxes  the above pre tax items are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as follows dollars in thousands cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expense   asset impairment and net disposition losses  net pre tax charges    net restructuring charges during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance related to the closing of our financial services check printing facility located in dallas  texas and our direct checks check printing facility located in anniston  alabama  as well as reductions in various functional areas primarily within our direct checks and financial services segments 
the closure of the dallas facility was primarily due to the loss of a major financial institution client whose contract expired at the end of the other reductions were a result of the continuing decline in check usage  as well as increased productivity 
both the dallas and anniston facilities were closed during the fourth quarter of we expect the other employee reductions to be substantially completed during the first half of the restructuring charges included estimated severance benefits for employees 
the related severance payments are being funded by cash from operations 
also during  we reversed million of previously recorded restructuring accruals due to fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
these restructuring charges and reversals are reflected as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance related to the closing of three of our financial services check printing facilities and other reductions in employees within financial services and our corporate support group 
we were able to close the three check printing facilities because of the expertise we have developed in logistics  productivity and inventory management  as well as the decline in check usage 
the other employee reductions were the result of our ongoing cost management efforts 
all three check printing facilities were closed during  and the other employee reductions were also substantially completed during in total  employees received a total of million in severance payments  which were funded by cash from operations 
during  we also reversed million of previously established restructuring accruals due to fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
these restructuring charges and reversals are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million 
as a result of the five facility closings and other employee reductions  we realized net cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in  in comparison to our results of operations 
in  we anticipate net cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense  in comparison to our results of operations 
reduced costs consist primarily of labor and facility expenses such as insurance  taxes  depreciation and maintenance 
in addition to a total of million of severance payments  we also incurred other costs related to the closing of facilities  including equipment moves  training and travel 
these costs were expensed as incurred  primarily as cost of goods sold  and totaled million 
of this amount  million was expensed in and million was expensed in we are also improving our remaining check printing facilities to allow them to handle the increased volume 
these improvements  which are expected to total approximately million  are capitalized and depreciated  primarily as cost of goods sold  over their estimated useful lives 
during  million was spent on these improvements and million was spent in during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance related primarily to manufacturing employees within our financial services segment and various functional areas within our direct checks segment 
these reductions were the result of our ongoing cost management efforts and were completed during in total  employees received million in severance payments 
during  we also reversed million of previously established restructuring accruals 
these restructuring charges and reversals are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million 
further information regarding our restructuring accruals can be found under the caption note restructuring accruals of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report 
change in accounting for inventory on july   we changed the method of accounting for a portion of our inventories 
inventories previously accounted for under the last in  first out lifo method are now accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method 
this change resulted in a decrease in cost of goods sold of million  primarily in our financial services segment 
this equates to an increase in net income of million  or per diluted share 
the effect of this accounting change on prior periods was immaterial  as was the effect on the current period 
as such  we did not restate prior period financial statements to reflect this change 
we consider the fifo method to be preferable 
the recently acquired nebs business also utilized the fifo method  and now we have a consistent accounting methodology across the company 
additionally  the effect on net income of utilizing the fifo method is not significantly different than the results that would be obtained using the lifo method 
asset impairment losses during  we recorded asset impairment losses of million  primarily in the financial services segment 
the impaired assets consisted of both manufacturing technologies and software 
we had been intending to implement the manufacturing technologies during however  having already realized many efficiencies in our manufacturing function as a result of other initiatives  including the implementation of lean manufacturing  the incremental benefits expected from these technologies no longer warranted their implementation 
the impaired software was intended to replace several of our existing systems and bring various areas of the company onto one platform 
however  based on our continuing evaluation of investment initiatives  we determined that the costs to implement the system and the timeline for implementation did not result in an adequate return on our investment 
the majority of the impaired assets had no alternative uses and could not be sold to third parties 
thus  these assets were written down to a carrying value of zero 
certain related hardware was sold to third parties and was written down to its fair value less costs to sell 
of the total asset impairment losses  million related to property  plant and equipment and million related to intangible assets 
post retirement benefit curtailment gain during the fourth quarter of  we amended our retiree health care plan to limit the number of employees eligible for benefits under the plan 
in order to receive the current level of benefits  employees must reach years of service and points total of age and years of service prior to january  employees reaching years of service and points between january  and december  are eligible for the current level of benefits  however  their premiums will not be reduced once they become eligible for medicare as is currently the case 
employees reaching years of service and points after december  must pay the full cost of coverage if they elect to participate in our health care plan 
as a result of this plan change  we recognized a curtailment gain of million during the fourth quarter of this gain is reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold of million and a reduction of sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
this plan change resulted in a million decrease in our post retirement benefit expense 
adjustments to provision for income taxes during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
a prior year federal audit period was closed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and we reached agreements with two states to favorably settle proposed income tax audit assessments 
as a result  the related reserves were no longer required 
also during  we recorded a million charge for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards which expired in during the fourth quarter of  the internal revenue service irs completed its review of our income tax returns for through as a result  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
certain irs rules were clarified in a manner favorable to us  and the related reserves were no longer required 
substantially offsetting these reversals in was a million charge for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards 
at december   we had capital loss carryforwards of approximately million which expired in by the fourth quarter of  the predominance of negative evidence indicated that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with a majority of the capital loss carryforwards would not be realized as certain tax planning strategies upon which we intended to rely were no longer considered to be prudent or feasible 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we are reporting this change in accounting principle using the modified prospective method of adoption described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
beginning in  our results of operations reflect compensation expense for all employee stock based compensation  including the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to this method results in the same amount of compensation expense which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
been applied from its original effective date 
prior to  we accounted for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method of accounting  no compensation expense was recognized for stock options or for our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we implemented changes to our long term compensation strategy 
rather than using stock options as the exclusive form of long term incentive  we now utilize a combination of stock options  performance shares and restricted stock 
all such awards are granted under our shareholder approved stock incentive plan 
the level of shares earned under the performance share component is contingent upon the attainment of specific performance targets over a three year period 
the fair value of the performance shares granted is equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant 
compensation expense is recorded over the three year performance period based on our estimate of the number of shares which will be earned by the award recipients 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we issued  restricted shares to employees 
the fair value of these awards is equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant 
compensation expense is recorded over the three year vesting period 
total stock based compensation expense was million for this expense is reflected as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
total stock based compensation expense was million in and million in these amounts are reflected in sg a expense in our consolidated statements of income for those years 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
the new statement is referred to as sfas no 
r and is entitled share based payment 
the new statement requires companies to recognize expense for stock based compensation in the statement of income 
we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
r to result in a significant change in the compensation expense we currently recognize in our statements of income 
consolidated results of operations dollars and shares in thousands  except per share amounts income from continuing operations    loss from discontinued operations net income    net income per share basic diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding basic    diluted includes common stock equivalents   income from continuing operations the increase in income from continuing operations in  as compared to  was primarily due to the acquisition of nebs  manufacturing productivity improvements and other cost management efforts  partially offset by higher interest expense in due to financing associated with the nebs acquisition and the reversal of income tax reserves in the decrease in income from continuing operations in  as compared to  was primarily due to a decline in unit volume  higher interest expense due to financing share repurchases and an increase in net pre tax charges discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments  partially offset by the reversal of income tax reserves in during and  we accounted for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no

during  we purchased million shares and during  we purchased million shares 
the change in average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases  partially offset by the impact of shares issued under employee stock purchase and stock incentive plans  resulted in a increase in earnings per share for as compared to despite the decrease in income from continuing operations in  as compared to  diluted earnings per share increased because average shares outstanding were lower due to our share repurchase programs

the acquisition of nebs contributed revenue of million in the million decrease in revenue for our other businesses compared to was due to a decrease in units because of an overall decline in the number of checks being written as a result of the increasing use of alternative payment methods 
our direct checks segment was also impacted by lower direct mail consumer response rates  longer reorder cycles due to promotional strategies for multi box orders and lower customer retention 
these decreases in unit volume were partially offset by increased financial institution referrals for our small business services segment 
partially offsetting the volume decline was a increase in revenue per unit as compared to due to continued strength in selling premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added products and services such as express delivery and fraud prevention  price increases in our direct checks and small business services segments and a million contract buy out payment from a former financial institution client in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by increased competitive pricing pressure within our financial services segment 
the decrease in revenue in  as compared to  was due to a decrease in units resulting primarily from an overall decline in the number of checks being written due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods and negative economic conditions 
additionally  lower customer retention  multi box promotional strategies and lower direct mail consumer response rates for our direct checks segment and the timing of client gains and losses for our financial services segment contributed to the volume decline 
partially offsetting the decreased volume was a increase in revenue per unit 
the continued strength in selling premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added products and services such as express delivery and fraud prevention  as well as price increases  were partially offset by increased competitive pricing pressure within our financial services segment

the decrease in gross margin in  as compared to  was due primarily to pricing pressure within financial services  lower unit volume and an increase in net restructuring charges of million  primarily related to the closing of three financial services check printing facilities 
partially offsetting these decreases were productivity improvements  cost management efforts  price increases  the continued strength in selling premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added products and services and the curtailment gain of million discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments

in january  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
further information concerning this change in accounting principle can be found under stock based compensation 
partially offsetting these increases were our cost management efforts  including savings realized from employee reductions  and lower discretionary spending 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of nebs results 
nebs has historically had a higher sg a percentage than our other businesses because nebs relies to a greater degree on direct mail and a direct sales force to acquire and retain customers 
additionally  as discussed above  nebs results included million of additional acquisition related amortization expense and million of integration expenses 
the decrease in sg a expense in  as compared to  was primarily due to a million decrease in performance based employee compensation  lower discretionary spending and cost management efforts as we managed through the challenging business and economic environments  as well as the curtailment gain of million discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments

we disclose these measures because they can be used to analyze profitability between companies and industries by eliminating the effects of financing ie  interest and capital investments ie  depreciation and amortization 
we believe these measures can indicate whether a company s earnings are adequate to pay its debts without regard to financing  capital structure or income taxes 
we also believe that increases in these measures depict increased ability to attract financing and increase the valuation of our business 
we do not consider these measures to be substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
instead  we believe that these are useful performance measures which should be considered in addition to those measures reported in accordance with gaap 
our committed lines of credit contain covenants requiring a minimum ebit to interest expense ratio 
the increase in these measures in  as compared to  was due to nebs results of operations  productivity improvements and other cost management efforts 
the decrease in  as compared to  was due primarily to the revenue decline and the increase in net pre tax charges discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments  partially offset by productivity improvements and other cost management efforts

nebs has historically had lower operating margins than our other businesses because of its non check product mix and its greater reliance on direct mail and a direct sales force to acquire and retain customers 
acquisition of new england business service  inc 
as discussed earlier  on june   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of nebs for per share and agreed to redeem all outstanding nebs stock options for per option share less the option exercise price 
as of december   substantially all of the direct costs of the acquisition had been paid 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was comprised of the following dollars in thousands cash payments for nebs common stock  cash payments to redeem nebs stock options  direct costs of the acquisition  total purchase price  amount paid through december   cash acquired from nebs  payments for acquisition through december   net of cash acquired  to finance the acquisition  we utilized million of an million bridge financing agreement  as well as commercial paper 
we re financed these borrowings in october when we issued million of long term debt 
further details concerning this long term debt can be found in liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
nebs operating results are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we finalized our allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
this allocation is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  our allocation of the purchase price reflects million of restructuring accruals for nebs activities which we have decided to exit 
these accruals primarily include severance payments  as well as million due under noncancelable operating leases on facilities which have been or will be vacated as we consolidate operations 
the severance accruals include payments due employees 
this includes employees in the tucker  georgia printing facility which was closed during the fourth quarter of  the los angeles  california facility which we plan to close by the end of and the athens  ohio facility which we will begin closing in and will be completely closed by mid additionally  the accruals include employees in various functional areas throughout the organization resulting from our shared services approach to manufacturing and certain sg a functions 
the severance accruals also include amounts due to certain nebs executives under change of control provisions included in their employment agreements  as we eliminate redundancies between the two companies 
restructuring payments are expected to be substantially completed by the end of  utilizing cash from operations 
as a result of these facility closures and employee reductions  we expect to realize cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in  in comparison to nebs historical results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we disposed of substantially all of the operations of nebs european businesses 
this disposal reflects our intention to focus on our north american operations and was completed on december  net proceeds from the sale were million  subject to subsequent adjustment based on an audit of the companies december  balance sheets 
no gain or loss was recognized on this disposition as the assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date 
also during the fourth quarter of  we announced the planned sale of nebs apparel business  premiumwear 
this sale will allow us to focus our resources on the many critical initiatives underway within small business services 
we anticipate that this sale will be completed in the results of operations of these businesses are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of million 
we believe that the nebs acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill primarily because of its industry position  the potential to introduce products across multiple channels and the ability to realize cost synergies 
the following illustrates our allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  inventories and supplies  deferred income taxes  other current assets  long term investments  property  plant and equipment  assets held for sale  intangibles  goodwill  other non current assets  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  long term debt due within one year  long term debt  deferred income taxes  other non current liabilities  total purchase price  segment results additional financial information regarding our business segments appears under the caption note business segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report 
small business services small business services is comprised of the newly acquired nebs business and our former business services segment 
this segment sells checks  forms and related products to more than six million small businesses and home offices through direct response marketing  financial institution referrals and via sales representatives  independent distributors and the internet 
the following table shows the results of this segment for and dollars in thousands increase decrease revenue    operating income    of revenue the nebs acquisition contributed revenue of million in additionally  the growth in revenue resulted from higher volume and price increases 
financial institution referrals increased due to the timing of client gains and losses and due to our focus on expanding the utilization of this program with our financial institution clients 
partially offsetting these improvements was the overall decline in the number of checks being written due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods 
the increase in operating income was due to the acquisition of nebs  the revenue growth and lower discretionary spending  partially offset by increased customer care costs in support of the higher revenue level 
the decrease in operating margin was due to nebs lower margin business 
nebs has historically had lower operating margins than our other businesses because of its non check product mix and its greater reliance on direct mail and a direct sales force to acquire and retain customers 
the following table shows the results of this segment for and dollars in thousands increase decrease revenue    operating income    of revenue the increase in revenue resulted from both higher unit volume and higher revenue per unit 
financial institution referrals increased  and we began to realize the benefit of being the endorsed supplier of business checks and forms for the microsoft money and microsoft business solutions products 
additionally  revenue per unit increased due to improved selling techniques and price increases 
partially offsetting these improvements was the overall decline in the number of checks being written due to negative economic conditions and the increasing use of alternative payment methods 
the increase in operating income was due to the revenue increase  partially offset by higher commissions resulting from increased financial institution referrals and business alliances  as well as higher employee costs related to transforming our customer care organization from a service to a selling environment 
financial services financial services sells personal and business checks  related products and check merchandising services to financial institutions 
additionally  we offer enhanced services to our financial institution clients  such as customized reporting  file management  expedited account conversion support and fraud prevention 
the following table shows the results of this segment for and dollars in thousands increase decrease revenue    operating income    of revenue the decrease in revenue was primarily due to an overall decline in the number of checks being written due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods  as well as competitive pricing pressure 
these revenue decreases were partially offset by increased sales of premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added services  as well as a million contract buy out in the third quarter of the increase in operating income was the result of cost management efforts  including savings realized from employee reductions  productivity improvements and lower discretionary spending  partially offset by the revenue decline 
the following table shows the results of this segment for and dollars in thousands increase decrease revenue    operating income    of revenue the decrease in revenue was due to continued competitive pricing pressure and lower volume resulting from an overall decline in the number of checks being written due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods and negative economic conditions 
additionally  the timing of financial institution client gains and losses impacted this segment 
these revenue decreases were partially offset by increased sales of premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added services 
the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of the revenue decline and higher severance and asset impairment charges 
financial services recorded net restructuring charges of million in  compared to net restructuring charges of million in the restructuring charges were for employee severance related to the closing of three check printing facilities  as well as other employee reductions 
the restructuring charges recorded in related to employee reductions in both manufacturing and sg a functions 
additionally  financial services recorded asset impairment charges of million in the net restructuring and asset impairment charges were discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments 
partially offsetting these decreases in operating income were lower discretionary spending and cost management efforts lower performance based employee compensation  production efficiencies and million related to the curtailment gain discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments 
direct checks direct checks sells checks and related products directly to consumers through direct mail and the internet

we also use e commerce strategies to direct traffic to our websites 
direct checks sells under the checks unlimited and designer checks brand names 
the following table shows the results of this segment for and dollars in thousands increase decrease revenue    operating income    of revenue the decrease in revenue was due to lower unit volume resulting from an overall decline in the number of checks being written  lower consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements  longer reorder cycles due to our promotional strategies for multi box orders and lower customer retention 
partially offsetting the revenue pressures from the volume decline was an increase in revenue per order due to price increases  the improved effectiveness of our selling techniques and continued strength in selling premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added products and services 
the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the revenue decline and a million increase in advertising expense due to new product efforts  partially offset by productivity improvements and cost management initiatives  including savings realized from employee reductions

partially offsetting the revenue pressures from the volume decline was an increase in revenue per order due to continued strength in selling premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added services  as well as price increases 
the increase in operating income was due to efficiencies within the manufacturing and order entry functions and cost management efforts  which more than offset the revenue decline 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the following table shows our cash flow activity for the last three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows dollars in thousands continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used by investing activities   net cash provided used by financing activities  effect of exchange rate change on cash  net cash provided used by continuing operations  discontinued operations  net change in cash and cash equivalents   the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in  as compared to  was due primarily to our cost management initiatives and productivity improvements  a million decrease in contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients within the financial services segment  lower direct checks advertising spend in and a million decrease in payments made for profit sharing and pension contributions 
net cash provided by operating activities in was negatively impacted million due to nebs severance payments  payments due to executive officers under change of control agreements and profit sharing and pension payments related to nebs pre acquisition results of operations 
during  cash inflows generated from net income less non cash expenses were utilized primarily to make income tax payments of million  voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust contributions of million  employee profit sharing and pension contributions of million  interest payments of million and contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients of million 
the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in  as compared to  was due primarily to the lower earnings discussed earlier under consolidated results of operations  changes in accounts payable  the amount and timing of advertising spending within our direct checks segment and a million increase in contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients within the financial services segment 
during  cash inflows generated from net income less non cash expenses were utilized primarily to make income tax payments of million  contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients of million  employee profit sharing and pension contributions of million and veba trust contributions of million 
during  cash inflows generated from net income less non cash expenses were utilized to fund income tax payments of million  employee profit sharing and pension contributions of million  contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients of million and veba trust contributions of million 
significant cash inflows for each year were as follows dollars in thousands net proceeds from short term and long term debt   net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations    proceeds from shares issued under employee plans   significant cash outflows for each year were as follows dollars in thousands payments for acquisition  net of cash acquired  payments on long term debt    cash dividends paid to shareholders    purchases of capital assets    payments for common shares repurchased    settlement of interest rate lock agreements   we believe that important measures of our financial strength are the ratio of ebit to interest expense  and the ratio of free cash flow to total debt 
ebit to interest expense was times for  times for and times for our committed lines of credit contain covenants requiring a minimum ebit to interest expense ratio on a four quarter trailing basis of times 
the decrease in was primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher debt levels to fund the acquisition of nebs and to fund share repurchases earlier in the year 
this ratio will continue to decrease through the first three quarters of due to re financing of a portion of our short term debt with higher rate long term debt and also higher debt levels 
nonetheless  we believe the risk of violating our financial covenants is low as we expect solid profitability and cash flow to continue 
the decrease in  as compared to  was primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher interest rates and debt levels primarily due to the issuance of million of long term notes in december the comparable ratio of net income to interest expense was times for  times for and times for further information regarding ebit was provided earlier under consolidated results of operations 
free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap 
we monitor free cash flow on an ongoing basis  as it measures the amount of cash generated from our operating performance after investment initiatives and the payment of dividends 
it represents the amount of cash available for interest payments  debt service  general corporate purposes and strategic initiatives 
we do not consider free cash flow to be a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
instead  we believe that free cash flow is a useful liquidity measure which should be considered in addition to those measures reported in accordance with gaap 
the measure of free cash flow to total debt is a liquidity measure which illustrates to what degree our free cash flow covers our existing debt 
free cash flow is derived from net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations as follows dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations    purchases of capital assets    cash dividends paid to shareholders    free cash flow    free cash flow to total debt was for  for and for we calculate free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of capital assets and dividends paid to shareholders 
the increase in  as compared to  was primarily due to the increase in operating cash flow discussed earlier 
this impact was partially offset by the higher debt level as of december   due to financing required for the nebs acquisition 
the decrease in  as compared to  was due to the higher level of debt outstanding as of december   which was utilized to fund share repurchases  as well as the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed earlier 
these decreases were partially offset by the lower level of capital asset purchases in as we reduced discretionary spending and the lower level of dividends paid due to fewer shares outstanding 
the comparable ratio of net cash provided by operating activities to total debt was for  for and for total debt outstanding was comprised of the following dollars in thousands december  senior  unsecured notes due october   net of discount senior  unsecured notes due december   net of discount senior  unsecured notes due october   net of discount senior  unsecured notes due september    variable rate senior  unsecured notes due november  long term portion of capital lease obligations   long term portion of debt   commercial paper   variable rate senior  unsecured notes due november   capital lease obligations due within one year   total debt   in october  we issued million of senior  unsecured notes maturing on october  and million of senior  unsecured notes maturing on october  the notes were issued via a private placement under rule a of the securities act of these notes were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission sec via a registration statement which became effective on november  interest payments are due each april and october

during  we entered into million of forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge  or lock in  the interest rate on a portion of the million debt we issued in october the termination of the lock agreements yielded a deferred pre tax loss of million 
this loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and is being reclassified ratably to our statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the related debt 
during  we entered into two forward rate lock agreements to effectively hedge  or lock in  the annual interest rate on million of the million notes we issued in december upon issuance of the notes  these lock agreements were terminated  yielding a deferred pre tax loss of million  which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is being reclassified ratably to our statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the ten year term of the notes 
we currently have a million commercial paper program in place which carries a credit rating of a p this credit rating was downgraded from a p during the second quarter of due to the additional debt we issued in conjunction with the acquisition of nebs 
if for any reason we were unable to access the commercial paper markets  we would rely on our committed lines of credit for liquidity 
the daily average amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   million was outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
the daily average amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   million was outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of during  we also utilized a bridge financing agreement to initially fund a portion of the nebs acquisition 
the daily average amount outstanding under this bridge financing agreement during was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
during the third quarter of  we utilized commercial paper borrowings to pay off the bridge financing agreement 
this agreement was terminated during the fourth quarter of we also have committed lines of credit which primarily support our commercial paper program 
we have a day line of credit for million which expires in july and carries a commitment fee of ten basis points 
we also have two five year lines of credit 
one five year line of credit is for million and expires in august the other line of credit is for million and expires in july both five year lines of credit carry commitment fees of basis points 
the credit agreements governing the lines of credit contain customary covenants regarding the ratio of ebit to interest expense and levels of subsidiary indebtedness 
no amounts were drawn on these lines of credit during or during  and no amounts were outstanding under these lines of credit as of december  to the extent not needed to support outstanding commercial paper or letters of credit  we may borrow funds under our committed lines of credit 
as of december   million was available under our committed lines of credit for borrowing or for support of additional commercial paper  as follows dollars in thousands total available expiration date day line of credit  july five year line of credit  august five year line of credit  july total committed lines of credit  commercial paper outstanding  letters of credit outstanding  net available for borrowing as of december   we also have an uncommitted bank line of credit for million available at variable interest rates 
no amounts were drawn on this line of credit during or during  and no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit as of december  absent certain defined events of default under our committed credit facilities  there are no significant contractual restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends 
in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased million shares under this authorization 
although this authorization remains in place  we will most likely not repurchase a significant number of additional shares in the near future 
instead  we intend to focus on paying down the debt we issued to complete the nebs acquisition 
changes in financial condition the table included earlier under acquisition of new england business service  inc illustrates the allocation of the nebs purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the acquisition of nebs explains most of the significant changes in our balance sheet from december  contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment decreased million from december  these costs are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
changes in contract acquisition costs during were as follows dollars in thousands balance  december   cash payments  change in accruals  amortization  balance  december   the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or obtain clients 
beginning in  as competitive pressure intensified  both the number of financial institution clients requiring contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments increased 
although we anticipate that we will continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid is dependent on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  the actions of our competitors  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
we anticipate that these payments will continue to be a significant use of cash 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
the impact of these costs is the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made as opposed to providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
based on the contract acquisition cost balance as of december   estimated amortization for each of the next five years ending december is as follows dollars in thousands shareholders deficit was million as of december  we are in a deficit position due to the required accounting treatment for share repurchases 
share repurchases during the past three years were as follows dollars and shares in thousands dollar amount    number of shares   given the strength of our financial position  as reflected in our cash flow and coverage ratios such as ebit to interest expense and free cash flow to total debt  we do not expect our shareholders deficit position to result in any adverse reaction from rating agencies or others that would negatively affect our liquidity or financial condition 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt and related interest    commercial paper   capital lease obligations and related interest     operating lease obligations     purchase obligations     other long term liabilities     total      long term debt consists of the senior  unsecured notes discussed earlier under liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
the amounts presented in the table above for long term debt include both principal and interest payments  using the current interest rate of for the million variable rate notes 
we currently have commitments under both operating and capital leases 
our capital lease obligations bear interest at rates of to and are due through we have also entered into operating leases on certain facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations include amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for information technology services related to network servers  personal computers  telecommunications  software development and support and help desk services 
additionally  purchase obligations include amounts due under direct checks direct mail advertising agreements and royalty agreements 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor 
as such  these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here 
certain of the contracts with third party service providers allow for early termination upon the payment of specified penalties 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would incur penalties of million as of december  other long term liabilities consist primarily of amounts due for contract acquisition costs  workers compensation and deferred officers compensation 
of the million reported as long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the payments shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts include the following a portion of the amount due under our deferred officers compensation plan under this plan  employees begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur 
environmental remediation costs during  we purchased an environmental insurance policy which covers pre existing conditions from third party claims and cost overruns for years at owned  leased and divested sites  as well as any new conditions discovered at currently owned or leased sites for ten years 
as a result  we expect to receive reimbursements from the insurance company for environmental remediation costs we incur 
the related receivables from the insurance company are reflected in other current assets and other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets in amounts equal to our environmental liabilities 
items which will not be paid in cash  such as a deferred gain resulting from a sale leaseback transaction with an unaffiliated third party 
total contractual obligations do not include the following payments to our defined contribution pension and k plans the amounts payable under our defined contribution pension plans and our k plans are dependent on the number of employees providing services throughout the year  their wage rates and in the case of the k plans  whether employees elect to participate in the plans 
payments to the canadian pension plan this plan is fully funded by a trust which we have established for this purpose 
trust assets can only be utilized to fund pension payments 
the assets of the trust have been invested 
if these investments do not perform as expected  we may be required to provide further funding to the trust 
however  we cannot predict when  or if  further funding will be required 
the projected benefit obligation for this plan was million as of december  profit sharing payments the amounts payable under our profit sharing plans are dependent on the financial performance of the company 
payments for our retiree health care plans benefits paid under our retiree health care plan are dependent on the level of medical costs incurred by plan participants 
additionally  we have contributed funds to a trust for the purpose of funding our retiree health care plan 
trust assets can be utilized only to pay medical costs of plan participants 
thus  we have the option of paying retiree medical costs from the trust or from the general assets of the company 
income tax payments which will be remitted on our earnings  or contributions which may be made to the veba trust which we use to fund employee and retiree medical and severance payments 
off balance sheet arrangements contingent commitments it has not been our practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
there have historically been no material losses related to such indemnifications  and we do not expect any material adverse claims in the future 
we have established a formal contract review process to assist in identifying significant indemnification clauses 
we are not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  or on our access to  or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we have not established any special purpose entities 
related party transactions we have entered into no significant related party transactions during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to goodwill and indefinite lived trade names  income taxes  restructuring accruals and post retirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we implemented one significant change to our accounting policies during on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this change in accounting principle is discussed in further detail under stock based compensation 
application of critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite lived trade names as of december   we had goodwill of million  comprised of million from the acquisition of nebs and million related to our direct checks segment s acquisition of designer checks in goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate that an impairment has occurred 
as discussed earlier under segment results  our direct checks segment has been impacted by the decline in check usage  lower consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements  longer re order cycles due to multi box promotional strategies and lower customer retention rates 
to date  we have been able to offset the impact of the resulting volume decline through improved selling techniques  price increases and cost management efforts 
however  eventually we may no longer be able to offset the impact of continuing volume declines 
assuming the business conditions for direct checks remain as they are and we are unable to offset the impact of continuing volume declines  eventually the goodwill associated with the designer checks acquisition will be impaired  and we will be required to reflect the impairment charge in our results of operations 
we also have indefinite lived trade names of million as of december   resulting from the acquisition of nebs 
we will continually evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we subsequently determine that one or more of these assets have a finite useful life  we will first test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest 
our reserves for contingent tax liabilities totaled million as of december   and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that our current tax reserves are adequate  and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income in the future 
during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
a prior year federal audit period was closed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and we reached agreements with two states to favorably settle proposed income tax audit assessments 
as a result  the related reserves were no longer required 
during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
during the fourth quarter of  the irs completed its review of our income tax returns for through certain irs rules were clarified in a manner favorable to us  and the related reserves were no longer required 
substantially offsetting these reversals in was a million charge for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards which expired in by the fourth quarter of  the predominance of negative evidence indicated that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with a majority of the capital loss carryforwards would not be realized as certain tax planning strategies upon which we intended to rely were no longer considered to be prudent or feasible 
restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
the acquisition of nebs has resulted in even larger restructuring accruals as we combine the two companies and exit certain activities 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as many times employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from actual employee behavior  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
with regards to our employee reduction initiatives  we subsequently reversed million of the original restructuring accruals as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
no significant adjustments were made to the accruals related to our or employee reduction initiatives 
post retirement benefits our net post retirement benefit expense was million in  million in and million in our business segments record post retirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold or sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our post retirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the expected health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our post retirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods could be impacted 
in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
in measuring the net post retirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be and our ultimate health care inflation rate for and beyond was assumed to be 
a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
unrecognized gains and losses are reflected in post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan  which is currently nine years 
as of december   our unrecognized net actuarial loss was million 
of this amount  million resulted from changes in the discount rate assumption 
during each of the last three years we have lowered our discount rate assumption due to decreases in interest rates 
as of december   million of the unrecognized net actuarial loss resulted from changes in our assumed health care cost trend rate 
in recent years we have increased our heath care cost trend rate assumption to reflect the current trend of increasing medical costs 
also as of december   million of the unrecognized net actuarial loss resulted from differences between our expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets 
since this assumption takes a long term view of investment returns  there may be differences between the expected rate of return and the actual rate of return on plan assets in the short term 
the remainder of the net actuarial loss amount primarily related to differences between our assumed medical costs and actual experience and changes in the employee population 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended our retiree health care plan to limit the number of employees eligible for benefits under the plan 
this change was discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments and resulted in a curtailment gain of million in this gain is reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold of million and a reduction of sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
this plan change resulted in a million decrease in our post retirement benefit expense 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of this fsp outlines the appropriate accounting treatment for the effects of the new medicare law  including the required financial statement disclosures  and supersedes the previous guidance issued by the fasb in january the new medicare law introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare plan 
our retiree medical plans do provide prescription drug coverage which is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare plan 
effective april   we elected to adopt the accounting treatment required by fsp no 
fas utilizing the retroactive application method 
in accordance with this accounting guidance  we completed a re measurement of our plan assets and liabilities as of december  the federal subsidy provided for under the new medicare law resulted in a million reduction in our accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december  and resulted in a million reduction in our post retirement benefit expense for in november  the fasb ratified a consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf regarding issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
this issue provides additional guidance concerning situations when the disposal of a component of a business should be reported as discontinued operations in a company s financial statements 
we applied the guidance contained in this issue when analyzing the businesses reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  as discussed earlier under acquisition of new england business service  inc in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of this fsp states that the tax deduction provided for under the new law should be recorded as a special deduction and not as a reduction in the tax rate 
thus  the tax benefit of the deduction is recognized in the periods the deduction is reported on the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities do not reflect the deductions to be taken in future years 
since the deduction is effective for taxable years beginning after december   there was no impact on our provision for income taxes 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of this fsp allows additional time for companies to determine how the new law affects a company s accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings 
the new law provides for a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated and which meet certain requirements 
we are currently evaluating whether any of the earnings of our canadian operations will be repatriated in accordance with the terms of this law 
the maximum amount of earnings that could be repatriated is approximately million  which would result in tax expense of approximately million 
we expect our evaluation to be completed in the second quarter of in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
the new statement is referred to as sfas no 
r and is entitled share based payment 
this new statement was discussed earlier under stock based compensation 
outlook we expect that revenue will be up from  while operating income will be down 
the full year impact of the nebs acquisition and continued growth in revenues from our small business services business referral program will partially offset the decline in our other two business segments 
within small business services  we have provided extensive training to our sales associates to transition that organization from a service to a selling environment 
we have also continued to partner with our financial institution clients to increase their participation in our business referral program 
additionally  the acquisition of nebs expands our product offerings  customer base and non check revenue 
financial services revenue is expected to decrease approximately million and operating margin is expected to decrease approximately four percentage points due to the loss of a major financial institution client and continued pricing pressure 
our operating margin is also expected to decrease as a full year of nebs results of operations will be included in our consolidated results 
nebs has historically had lower margins than our other businesses because of their business model 
additionally  nebs results of operations are expected to include million of additional acquisition related amortization expense 
as discussed earlier under restructuring charges  asset impairments and other developments  we expect to realize approximately million of net cost savings in from the closing of check printing facilities and other employee reductions 
these savings are in comparison to our results of operations 
however  it is becoming increasingly difficult to offset all of the revenue loss in the financial services and direct checks segments through our cost management efforts 
we expect diluted earnings per share to be between and for the first quarter of and approximately for the full year 
we anticipate that operating cash flow will exceed million in  compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to an expected increase in contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients and higher payments in early for performance based employee compensation related to our operating performance 
for  we expect nebs to contribute approximately to million of operating cash flow after the increased interest payments resulting from financing the acquisition 
we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of capital assets during approximately million is projected to be devoted to maintaining our business and integration projects  with the remainder targeted primarily for information technology initiatives 
our strong cash flows allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend payment from per share to per share in the first quarter of although dividends are subject to board of director approval on an ongoing basis  we currently expect no further changes to our dividend payment level 
the million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in august remains in place 
we do not intend to repurchase a significant number of additional shares in the near future  but intend to focus on paying down the debt issued to complete the acquisition of nebs 
we expect to pay down approximately million of debt during we intend to continue seeking cost saving opportunities throughout the company 
one example is the planned installation of the sap sales and distribution module in our order processing and call center operations 
this new system will reduce redundancy while standardizing systems and processes 
this project  which currently excludes the newly acquired nebs business  is expected to be completed by the end of in addition  we will continue to focus over the next several months on the successful integration of nebs 
we have announced our intention to utilize a shared services approach for both manufacturing and certain sg a functions 
as a result of this strategy  we closed the tucker  georgia facility in december and announced other reductions in employees across functional areas 
we also intend to close the facility in los angeles  california by the end of and we plan to close the facility in athens  ohio by mid our shared services approach will likely result in the exit of further activities 
to ensure that we continue to meet customer expectations  significant analysis is required before additional plans can be finalized 
with the exit of these facilities and by taking advantage of other operational synergies  we estimate that we will be able to eliminate at least million of costs annually beginning in  in comparison to nebs historical results of operations 
beginning in  we expect that the success of our small business services segment will offset the declines in our other two business segments 
we anticipate growth in our small business services segment due to our larger customer base  expanded products and services  and additional cost synergies 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information 
we are filing this cautionary statement in connection with the reform act 
when we use the words or phrases should result  believe  intend  plan  are expected to  targeted  will continue  will approximate  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions in this annual report on form k  in future filings with the sec  in our press releases and in oral statements made by our representatives  they indicate forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
we want to caution you that any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause them to be wrong 
some of these uncertainties and other factors are discussed below under certain factors that may affect future results many of which have been discussed in prior filings with the sec 
although we have attempted to compile a comprehensive list of these important factors  we want to caution you that other factors may prove to be important in affecting future operating results 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors  nor can we assess the impact each factor or combination of factors may have on our business 
you are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on those forward looking statements because they speak only of our views as of the date the statements were made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
certain factors that may affect future results the check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and  if it declines faster than expected  it could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
check printing is  and is expected to continue to be  an essential part of our business and the principal source of our operating income 
we primarily sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future 
however  according to our estimates  the total number of checks written by individuals and small businesses continued to decline slightly in  and the total number of personal  business and government checks written in the united states has been in decline since the mid s 
we believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  smart cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  electronic and other bill paying services  home banking applications and internet based payment services 
however  the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve consumer acceptance and replace checks  whether as a result of legislative developments  personal preference or otherwise  cannot be predicted with certainty 
a surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods could have a material  adverse effect on the demand for checks and a material  adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
we face intense competition in all areas of our business 
although we are the leading check printer in the united states  we face considerable competition 
in addition to competition from alternative payment systems  we also face intense competition from other check printers in our traditional financial institution sales channel  from direct mail sellers of checks  from sellers of business checks and forms  from check printing software vendors and  increasingly  from internet based sellers of checks to individuals and small businesses 
additionally  low price  high volume office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms  checks and related products to small businesses 
the corresponding pricing pressure placed on us has been significant and has resulted in reduced profit margins 
we expect these pricing pressures to continue to impact our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
continued competition could result in additional price reductions  reduced profit margins  loss of customers and an increase in up front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal 
continuing softness in direct mail response rates could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our direct checks segment and portions of our small business services segment have experienced declines in response and retention rates related to direct mail promotional materials 
we believe that these declines are attributable to a number of factors  including the decline in check usage  the overall increase in direct mail solicitations received by our target customers  the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms products and in the case of our direct to consumer check business  the multi box promotional strategies employed by us and our competitors 
to offset these impacts  we may have to modify and or increase our marketing and sales efforts  which could result in increased expense 
the profitability of our direct checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates  as well as the consumer response rates generated by such advertising  and there can be no assurances regarding the future cost  effectiveness and or availability of suitable advertising media 
competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect any of these increased costs in the prices of our products 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability in this situation 
consolidation among financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
the number of financial institutions has declined due to large scale consolidation in the last few years 
in recent months  financial institution consolidation activities have begun to increase once again 
margin pressures arise from such consolidation as merged entities seek not only the most favorable prices formerly offered to the predecessor institutions  but also additional discounts due to the greater volume represented by the combined entity 
this concentration greatly increases the importance of retaining our major financial institution clients and attracting significant additional clients in an increasingly competitive environment 
the increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by such consolidated entities also presents a risk that new and or renewed contracts with these institutions may not be secured on terms as favorable as those historically negotiated with these clients 
although we devote considerable efforts toward the development of a competitively priced  high quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry  there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the loss of a significant client can be counterbalanced through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients 
standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences 
continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  the price and performance capabilities of personal computers and related printers now provide a cost effective means to print low quality versions of business forms on plain paper 
additionally  electronic transaction systems and off the shelf business software applications have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by business forms products 
if we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we face uncertainty with respect to recent and future acquisitions 
we acquired nebs in june and have stated that we expect to eliminate at least million of nebs historical operating costs in as we integrate the two companies 
we have also stated that  beginning in  we expect the growth of our small business services segment to offset the impact of pricing pressure and declining personal check usage in our other segments 
the integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks  including  among others  difficulties in assimilating operations and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  potential loss of our key employees or key employees of acquired businesses  potential exposure to unknown liabilities and possible loss of our clients and customers or clients and customers of the acquired businesses 
while we anticipate that we will be able to achieve our stated objectives  we can provide no assurance that one or more of these factors will not negatively impact our results of operations 
in regards to future acquisitions  we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products  technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenues or earnings to any material extent 
significant acquisitions typically result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities or debt  or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets  and thus  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to successfully implement a project we have undertaken to replace major portions of our existing sales and distribution systems could negatively impact our business 
during  we will continue to expand our use of the sap software platform with the planned installation of the sap sales and distribution module 
once implemented  we expect the new system to reduce redundancy while standardizing systems and processes and reduce our costs 
this is a significant information systems project with wide reaching impacts on our internal operations and business 
we can provide no assurance that the amount of this investment will not exceed our expectations and result in materially increased levels of expense 
there is also no assurance that this initiative will achieve the expected cost savings or result in a positive return on our investment 
additionally  if the new system does not operate as intended  or is not implemented as planned  there could be disruptions in our business which could adversely affect our results 
forecasts involving future results reflect various assumptions that may prove to be incorrect 
from time to time  our representatives make predictions or forecasts regarding our future results  including  but not limited to  forecasts regarding estimated revenues  earnings or earnings per share 
any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions which are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  and are encouraged to use the entire available mix of historical and forward looking information made available by us  and other information affecting us and our products and services  including the factors discussed here 
in addition  independent analysts periodically publish reports regarding our projected future performance 
the methodologies we employ in arriving at our own internal projections and the approaches taken by independent analysts in making their estimates are likely different in many significant respects 
we expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise analysts or the public markets of our views regarding the current accuracy of the published estimates of independent analysts 
if you are relying on these estimates  you should pursue your own investigation and analysis of their accuracy and the reasonableness of the assumptions on which they are based 
we may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services 
in addition  designs licensed from third parties account for an increasing portion of our revenues  and there can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or on terms that would allow us to continue to be profitable with those products 
the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 
we rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws  trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks  software and know how 
we may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we are dependent upon third party providers for certain significant information technology needs 
we have entered into agreements with third party providers for the provision of information technology services  including software development and support services  and personal computer  telecommunications  network server and help desk services 
in the event that one or more of these providers is not able to provide adequate information technology services  we would be adversely affected 
although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources  a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply 
legislation relating to consumer privacy protection could harm our business 
we are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the gramm leach bliley act and other federal regulation and state law on the same subject 
these laws and regulations require us to develop and implement policies to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers nonpublic personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and annually thereafter 
these regulations could have the effect of foreclosing future business initiatives 
more restrictive legislation or regulations have been introduced in the past and could be introduced in the future in congress and the states 
we are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulations will be adopted in the future 
any future legislation or regulations could have a negative impact on our business  results of operations or prospects 
laws and regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet  e commerce or marketing practices generally relating to consumer privacy 
such laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet and or use of other sales or marketing vehicles 
as an example  new privacy laws could decrease traffic to our websites  decrease telemarketing opportunities and decrease the demand for our products and services 
additionally  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing property ownership  taxation  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may remain uncertain for a considerable length of time 
we may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have adverse effects on our business 
in accordance with current federal  state and local tax laws  and the constitutional limitations thereon  we currently collect sales  use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where our direct to consumer businesses have a physical presence 
one or more state or local jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other out of state companies which engage in remote or online commerce 
further  tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon is subject to change 
in addition  any new operations of these businesses in states where they do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by these businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws 
if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes beyond our current practices  it could have a material  adverse affect on our business 
we may be subject to environmental risks 
our check printing facilities are subject to many existing and proposed federal and state regulations designed to protect the environment 
in some instances  we owned and operated our check printing facilities before the environmental regulations came into existence 
we have sold former check printing facilities to third parties and in some instances have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities 
we have obtained insurance coverage related to environmental issues at certain of these facilities 
we believe that  based on current information  we will not be required to incur additional material and uninsured expense with respect to these sites  but unforeseen conditions could result in additional exposure at lesser levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during  we utilized commercial paper to pay off the bridge financing agreement used to finance the nebs acquisition  as well as to fund working capital requirements 
on october   we refinanced a portion of our commercial paper debt with fixed rate  long term debt 
in addition  we have various lines of credit available and capital lease obligations which are due through the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following dollars in thousands carrying amount fair value weighted average interest rate long term notes maturing october   long term notes maturing december   long term notes maturing october   commercial paper   long term notes maturing september   long term notes maturing november   capital lease obligations maturing through september  total debt   based on quoted market rates as of december   except for our capital lease obligations which are shown at carrying value 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of million for  million for and million for as a result of the acquisition of nebs in june  we are now exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in and loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies 
the effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and liquidity  as nebs foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
