overview we are a leading provider of an enterprise reporting application platform  a unified software platform that enables large organizations and packaged application software vendors to develop and deploy self service  customer and employee facing enterprise reporting applications 
enterprise reporting applications are intuitive  web portal like reporting applications that empower of users with decision making information 
our actuate product line provides a platform upon which global organizations companies with annual revenues greater than billion and packaged application software vendors develop and deploy mission critical enterprise reporting applications 
these applications retrieve business information from corporate databases and deliver it as interactive web pages  excel spreadsheets  and analytic cubes to customers  partners and employees around the globe 
our products and services are used by our customers to develop and deploy enterprise reporting applications across a range of business functions including financial management  sales management  account management  and customer self service 
we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our software products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
our total revenues for fiscal year were million  which were consistent with our prior fiscal year revenues of million 
license revenues decreased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year the decrease in license revenues was more than offset by growth in services revenues  which grew approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year this growth was primarily due to increases in maintenance pricing and the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
for fiscal year  net income was million or 
per diluted share compared with a net loss of million or per share in fiscal year the improvement in profitability was due to lower expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  provision for income taxes was million compared to million in fiscal year the million decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to a million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in fiscal year when we determined that such deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  total costs and expenses also decreased by million 
various factors contributed to the decrease including a decline of approximately million in legal fees associated with the microstrategy litigation 
the court ruled in favor of us regarding this matter in june north american total revenues decreased by approximately during the year from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  while revenues from our international regions increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year to date  we have sold our products 
table of contents 
index to financial statements internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and asia pacific 
during fiscal year  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues were derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year during fiscal year  three trends had a significant impact on our results of operations 
first  as an enterprise software vendor  we experienced a weak corporate spending environment for enterprise reporting applications 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly in second  in we continued to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence and enterprise reporting software purchases into fewer suppliers 
corporations were reluctant to buy software from new vendors 
this impacted our ability to acquire as many new global customers as planned 
if this trend continues  it will impact our business in finally  for the past several years  we experienced vigorous competition in the enterprise reporting market 
the existence of this competitive environment required additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which resulted in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the enterprise reporting market will be vigorous in during  we announced four strategic initiatives that we are undertaking to help improve the sale of our software products in the future 
these initiatives are as follows selling to it management we intend to re focus our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
solution selling to line of business management we are creating software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these solutions will initially be related to financial management and reporting 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
investing in the business intelligence reporting tool birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in creating a new open source code reporting tool  known as birt 
we hope that birt will eventually become widely adopted by java developers and will create demand for our other commercially available products 
the birt project is a long term initiative 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we intend to continue focusing on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
as of december   we had full time employees  a net decrease of employees  or  in our workforce reported as of december  during  positions were eliminated through our announced restructurings and the remaining positions were eliminated through attrition 
we expect that there will be an additional positions eliminated in fiscal year resulting from our restructuring announced in october approximately of the positions that were eliminated in fiscal year occurred in our sales and marketing group 
in the first quarter of we recognized  in severance  benefit and related legal costs when we initiated a restructuring of our french operations to size the operation to meet the expected business and economic environment for our products in france 
this restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction of five people 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring program 
this was to further align our cost structure with future revenue expectations 
we estimate that the restructuring plan will have eliminated approximately million in operating costs annually 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
therefore  only a portion of the costs associated with this restructuring are reflected in our results of operations for the fourth quarter of the total amount of these costs expensed during the quarter was approximately million 
we expect further additional residual costs associated with this restructuring will be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in march  we introduced a new price list with added focus on licensing our server products based on the number of named users as opposed to the number of cpus 
this change was made to allow for a lower entry price point for new customers as well as to address the increases in the performance of individual cpu s and the scalability of our software 
under our new licensing model  our server products can either be licensed on a cpu basis or on a named user basis 
these named user licenses are sold in predefined user blocks 
in conjunction with the introduction of named user pricing  we also significantly increased the list price for our cpu based licenses 
as maintenance and support is often priced as a percentage of software list price  in such cases  our pricing for maintenance has also increased accordingly 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company began the implementation of a new enterprise accounting system 
in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  all appropriate implementation costs are being capitalized from the beginning of the implementation project until the date in which the system is substantially complete 
we activated the new accounting system in the third quarter of fiscal year however  we were still in the application development stage of the project and continue to incur significant costs to further modify the system through the first quarter of fiscal year such costs continue to be capitalized in accordance with sop no 
until the system is deemed to be substantially complete  which we expect to occur in the first quarter of fiscal year as of december   a total of million has been capitalized under this project 
the total capitalized costs of this project are being amortized over an estimated useful life of seven years 
amortization began upon activation of the new system in august of fiscal year during  we implemented new requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of and recently enacted rules of the sec and nasdaq 
these efforts caused us to incur significant increased costs 
in particular  the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting under section are new and complex  and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation 
this ongoing process of reviewing  documenting and testing our internal controls over financial reporting has resulted in  and will likely continue to result in  a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
furthermore  achieving and maintaining compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and other new rules and regulations has required us to hire additional personnel and has and will continue to require us to use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
during the course of the audit of actuate corporation s financial statements  the company identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to an audit adjustment identified by our external auditors  kpmg llp  relating to the restructuring charge incurred in the fourth quarter of specifically  a decision was made to vacate a foreign facility and a liability aggregating  was recorded for costs to be incurred for its remaining term 
however  as of december   we had not met all of the requirements under sfas no 
to record this charge and  therefore  no liability should have been recorded 
the liability is now expected to be recorded in the first quarter of the restructuring charge was corrected prior to completion of the audit and  as a result  this correction did not have any effect on reported year end or previously reported financial results 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult and unreliable 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents 
index to financial statements accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
for example  we are required to exercise judgment in evaluating risk of concession when payments terms extend beyond the normal credit period ranging between net to days 
in certain circumstances  we may grant extended payment terms to our customers 
if such extended terms cause us to believe that the underlying fees are no longer fixed or determinable  we may recognize license revenues as payments become due and payable 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record a small provision for estimated sales returns on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenues could be overstated 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to the underlying elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from perpetual license sales upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we recognize associated maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance term and revenue from consulting and other services as the related services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also specifically reserve for all outstanding domestic consulting  training  and maintenance renewal invoices which are older than a specified number of months past due 
the company also records unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 

table of contents 
index to financial statements allowance for deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or reduce loss and increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
due to the current economic environment  increased competition  a history of net losses  and our uncertainty in projecting future taxable income  we have determined that we can no longer rely on projections of future taxable income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  as of december   we recorded a million increase to the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets generated in the current year 
contingencies 
we are or have been engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in litigation or settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  we implemented certain restructuring plans that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and write offs of fixed assets 
the restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
in fiscal year  we recorded a facility restructuring charge  which consisted of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property 
we reduced the amount of the facility restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we made  which we periodically re evaluate and adjust as appropriate  are based on estimates of such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublease the property and sublease rates 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for exiting the idle facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring charges 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional restructuring charge would be recorded and would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  customer lists  non compete agreements  experienced workforce  and trademarks 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal year as of december   the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal year as of december   the carrying amount of our goodwill was million 
valuation of minority interest in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan and we have the option to call the minority interest for approximately million as of december  our policy is to record a loss  if any  at the time that the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put and call option  we would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
we periodically perform a valuation analysis of the minority interest 
this valuation analysis includes assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether a loss is probable and the amount of the loss 
as of december   we concluded that a loss was not probable 
we consolidate of the operating results and all investments in the subsidiary are eliminated in consolidation 
recovery of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recovery of its long lived assets periodically by analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenues our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting  and training 
total revenues were million in fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year and decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues for any of the periods presented 
license fees 
revenues from license fees decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the domestic total license revenue decreased by from fiscal year to fiscal year whereas the international license revenues grew by in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in international license fees was primarily seen in our japanese and canadian subsidiaries  whose license fees grew by  and  from the prior year  respectively 
meanwhile  we saw a slight decrease in the license fees from the european regions from the prior year 
the decrease in domestic license fee revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a weak corporate spending environment for enterprise reporting applications and a more competitive environment in our market niche 
we have seen customers engage in vendor consolidation and our competitors have recently released competing products 
these factors have had an adverse impact on the demand for our products in domestic markets 
license revenues derived from our indirect channel partners  including oems  systems integrators and resellers  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for fiscal years  and  respectively 
services 
revenues from services are comprised of maintenance and support  consulting  and training 
service revenues increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increases in service revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year were primarily due to an increase in the worldwide installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
costs and expenses cost of license fees 
cost of license fees consists primarily of production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies  and localization costs 
cost of license fees increased by from million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year cost of license fees increased by from million  or of revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in cost of license fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a full year amortization of purchased technology as a result of our acquisition of nimble technology in fiscal year resulting in a net increase of  increased printing and production costs of  and an increase in royalties of  due to third parties 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in localization costs 
the increase in cost of license fees in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to partial year amortization of purchased technology as a result of our acquisition of nimble technology during the middle of fiscal year we recognized million  million  and  for the amortization of purchased technology in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect our cost of license fees as a percentage of revenues from license fees to gradually decrease in future periods primarily as a result of lower amortization of purchased technology 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
cost of services increased by or approximately million from million or of service revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal year cost of services decreased by from million  or of services revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in cost of services in absolute dollars in fiscal year is primarily a result of the increase in service revenue during the year 
although service revenue in absolute dollars increased by million over fiscal year  cost of services as a percentage of services revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this 
table of contents 
index to financial statements decrease is due to the fact that the primary driver in the service revenue increase was derived from maintenance and support  which have considerably lower costs associated with them than consulting services 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of services revenues during fiscal year was also primarily due to an increase in an on going maintenance and support revenue while maintaining corresponding expenses at the prior year level 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to a reduction of million in marketing program expenses and a reduction of million in professional and outside consulting services  both as a result of the company s efforts in fiscal year to focus on reducing overall marketing expenditures 
sales and marketing expenses also decreased in fiscal year as a result of a decrease in headcount 
this decrease in headcount was largely due to our two restructurings that were implemented globally 
at the end of fiscal year  we had employees in sales and marketing  compared with and employees at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expense decreased slightly in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to lower commissions earned on lower revenues and a reversal of accrued commissions that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year  of which approximately  was accrued in prior years 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in the range of in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year research and development expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to costs associated with the opening of our shanghai research facility totaling approximately  the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to higher rent and facility related charges totaling  as well as a slight increase in salaries and benefits related expenses of approximately  both resulting from the acquisition of nimble technology in july offsetting these increased expenses were lower depreciation expenses of  lower consulting expenses of approximately  and lower employee relations and other related charges of  in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  we had employees in research and development compared to and employees at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
the increases in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year and were due to the decline in our total revenues in fiscal years and  as compared to total revenues for the same period in fiscal year we believe that continued investments in technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively stable in absolute dollars in the short term 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs in finance  human resources  legal and tax functions  as well as audit and legal fees and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million or of total revenues in fiscal year the million decrease in general and administrative expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of million in legal costs associated with the microstrategy litigation  which ended favorably in fiscal year we also recorded a reversal of sales taxes of  in the second quarter of fiscal year due to a favorable outcome on our board of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements equalization audit 
in addition  we negotiated a more favorable property and liability insurance premium  which lowered the expense by approximately  in fiscal year these decreases were offset by increases in professional consulting fees and internal personnel costs of approximately million in fiscal year as a result of the company s compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the slight decrease of  in general and administrative expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to declines in depreciation expense of  bad debt expense of  and staffing related expenses of  these decreases were offset by increases in legal and accounting expenses totaling approximately  and property and liability insurance of  in fiscal year we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due primarily to the implementation of a program to ensure compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and ongoing legal expenses 
amortization of other intangibles 
on january   we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets safs  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  in addition  we reclassified million of acquired workforce  which is no longer defined as a separately identifiable intangible assets under sfas  as goodwill 
as a result  no acquired workforce amortization was recognized in fiscal year the provisions of sfas required the completion of a transitional impairment test within six months of adopting the accounting standard and any impairments identified must be treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test  which did not result in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
the provisions of sfas also require an annual impairment test  which we completed on october   october  and october  none of these annual impairment tests resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
amortization of other intangible assets was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the net decrease in amortization of other purchased intangible assets in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the customer base related to prior acquisitions in europe that were fully amortized by the middle of fiscal year this resulted in a decrease of approximately million offset by an increase in the amortization of purchased technology and workforce of  related to the acquisition of nimble technology  a development stage company 
the decrease in amortization of other purchased intangible assets in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was a result of the adoption of sfas  which reclassified acquired workforce as goodwill and amortization was no longer required 
we expect the estimated amortization expense of our existing other purchased intangible assets to be approximately million in fiscal year purchased in process research and development 
during the quarter ended september  and in connection with the acquisition of nimble technology  we recorded a charge to operations of  for purchased in process research and development 
the purchased in process research and development was expensed because it had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process research and development was computed using a cost approach analysis  whereby the value of the purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the current cost of replacing the asset with one of equivalent economic utility 
an independent third party determined the valuation of the purchased in process research and development 
we did not acquire any entities in fiscal year or and consequently did not record any purchased in process research and development costs 
restructuring charges 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this form k 
during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of a million facility exit charge and million in costs related to the reduction of our worldwide workforce 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the facility exit charge was the result of a long term non cancelable lease agreement that we entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in anticipation of a projected business expansion 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we decided to exit this facility 
the million facility exit charge consisted of million of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments net of million of estimated sublease income and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property eg  leasing commissions 
this facility exit charge also included a million write off of property and equipment primarily leasehold improvements as a result of the abandonment of the leased facilities 
during fiscal year  the company underwent two restructurings 
the first occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year when we initiated a restructuring of our french operation 
we undertook this restructuring in order to size the operation to meet the expected business and economic environment for our products in france and to shift our sales strategy in france from one based primarily on direct sales to a strategy more focused on indirect sales channels 
this restructuring consisted primarily of a workforce reduction and associated legal expenses  which resulted in a headcount reduction of five people and associated severance  benefit and related legal costs of  during the first quarter of in early october  we implemented an additional restructuring 
this company wide restructuring was undertaken to align our cost structure with future revenue expectations 
the costs associated with this restructuring totaled million in the fourth quarter of and were primarily comprised of severance and related costs 
we expect to incur an additional expenditure of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal year related to this restructuring 
these additional charges are primarily related to idle facility costs of our french facility 
according to financial accounting standards statement no 
sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in order to record the costs related to an idle facility  we must first cease use of the facility 
we expect to cease use of our french facility in the first quarter of fiscal year interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  are comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income  net  increased by from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  and decreased by from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the increase in interest and other income  net  in fiscal year was primarily due to improved returns on our cash and investments totaling approximately  and other gains totaling  related to currency exchange transactions with our international subsidiaries 
the decrease in interest and other income  net in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to higher yields on cash and short term investments in fiscal year and a decrease in interest rates in fiscal year from fiscal year provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of  million and  is based on pretax income of million  and pretax losses of million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses utilized  income tax credits and the reversal of reserves no longer required 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses not currently utilized  income tax credits  and the write off of deferred tax assets recognized in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses not currently utilized  income tax credits  and the recognition of additional deferred tax assets 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that did not occur in the increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that were initially recognized in we determined that such deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized 
we have determined that  based on a number of factors  as of december   no deferred tax assets should be recognized 
a valuation allowance has  therefore  been recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to zero 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or reduce loss and increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
due to the current economic environment  increased competition  a history of net losses  and our uncertainty in projecting future taxable income  we have determined that we can no longer rely on projections of future taxable income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded a million increase to the valuation allowance related to deferred tax benefit generated in the current year 
we will continue to assess our ability to realize the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted results 
on october   the american jobs creation act of jobs act was enacted 
among other provisions  the jobs act provides for a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities phased in from to  and a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad 
we do not plan to repatriate foreign earnings under the jobs act and have not yet determined the impact of the deduction for domestic production activities 
such deduction will first be available to the company in at this time  we do not expect that the deduction will have a material impact on our provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased  or to the december  balance noted above  from million as of december  our source of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments over the past three years have been primarily generated by our operations 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operations was million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of  net cash provided by operating activities increased this period primarily due to the fact that we generated net income in fiscal year while we experienced a net loss in cash from operating activities was also generated as a result of adjustments for non cash items of amortization and depreciation and an increase in deferred revenues resulting from improvements in our maintenance and support revenues 
these increases in cash generating activities were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable balances 
the higher accounts receivable balance at december  is reflected in the days sales outstanding dso number  which increased from days at december  to days at december  this high dso number was the result of several factors  including unusually high billings in the last month of the quarter as a percentage of total billings for the quarter 
cash from investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million during fiscal year  compared to million used in fiscal year  an increase of approximately million 
for fiscal year  the change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of short term investments 
this as well in increase in the purchase of property and equipment  mostly related to the implementation of our new enterprise accounting system 
furthermore  during fiscal year  we paid cash totaling million for the acquisition of nimble technology and acquisition expenses 
cash from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal year compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock in  offset by a lower level of stock repurchases in for fiscal year  net cash used in financing activities were derived from million in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open 
table of contents 
index to financial statements market  partially offset by proceeds derived from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans totaling approximately million 
for the same period last year  net cash provided by financing activities were primarily due from proceeds derived from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans totaling million  partially offset by the repurchase of shares of our common stock totaling approximately million 
year ended december  in thousands  except share data number of shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity or obtain credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our owned subsidiary in japan  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our future contractual obligations include minimum lease payments under operating leases at december   and are as follows in thousands fiscal year future minimum lease payment future contractual sublease income net future minimum lease payments thereafter of the remaining net future minimum lease payments  million is included in restructuring liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  in connection with the office building leases in south san francisco  california  we have provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit 
we have provided a security interest in all of our assets as collateral for the letter of credit 
investment in actuate japan 
as of december   the company owns of the outstanding shares of actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan and the company has the option to call the minority interest for approximately million 
the price increases each year by over the then prevailing long term prime rate 
actuate s policy is to record a loss  if any  at the time that the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put option  the company would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
actuate has not recorded any losses on the put call option to date

in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products

apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal year the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts  for fiscal year through fiscal year  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income loss per share

table of contents 
index to financial statements risk factors that may affect future results investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing actuate 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this report on form k  including the financial statements and the notes thereto 
our operating results may be volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet our estimates of quarterly and annual operating results or we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our stock may decrease significantly 
the susceptibility of our operating results to significant fluctuations makes any prediction  including our estimates  of future operating results unreliable 
in addition  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our operating results have in the past varied  and may in the future vary significantly due to factors such as the following demand for our products  the size and timing of significant orders for our products  a slowdown or a decrease in spending on information technology by our current and or prospective customers  the marketing by our competitors of products that are directly competitive with our products  the management  performance and expansion of our international operations  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  customers desire to consolidate their purchases of enterprise reporting and business intelligence software to one or a very small number of vendors from which a customer has already purchased software  general domestic and international economic and political conditions  including war  terrorism  and the threat of war or terrorism  sales cycles and sales performance of our indirect channel partners  changes in the way we and our competitors price our products and services  including maintenance and transfer fees  continued successful relationships and the establishment of new relationships with oems  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  the outcome or publicity surrounding any pending or threatened lawsuits  ability to make new products and product enhancements commercially available in a timely manner  budgeting cycles of our customers  failure to successfully manage acquisitions made by us  defects in our products and other product quality problems  failure to successfully meet hiring needs and unexpected personnel changes  
table of contents 
index to financial statements changes in the market segments and types of customers at which we focus our sales and marketing efforts  lost revenue due to the availability of open source products of actuate and its competitors  changes in perpetual licensing models to term or subscription based models with respect to which license revenue is not fully recognizable at the time of initial sale  and changes in service models with respect to which consulting services are performed on a fixed fee  rather than variable fee  basis 
because our software products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received  total revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
furthermore  several factors may require us  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  to defer recognition of license fee revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including whether the license agreement includes both software products that are then currently available and software products or other enhancements that are still under development  whether the license agreement relates entirely or partly to software products that are currently not available  whether the license agreement requires the performance of services that may preclude revenue recognition until successful completion of such services  whether the license agreement includes acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance  and whether the license agreement includes undelivered elements including limited terms or durations that may preclude revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance 
in addition  we may in the future experience fluctuations in our gross and operating margins due to changes in the mix of our domestic and international revenues  changes in the mix of our direct sales and indirect sales and changes in the mix of license revenues and service revenues  as well as changes in the mix among the indirect channels through which our products are offered 
a significant portion of our total revenues in any given quarter is derived from existing customers 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth  if any  will be substantially dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from license fees and services from existing customers  to expand our customer base and to increase the average size of our orders 
to the extent that such increases do not occur in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our expense levels and any plans for expansion  including plans to increase our sales and marketing and research and development efforts  are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues fall below our expectations and we are unable to reduce our spending in response quickly  our business  operating results  and financial condition are likely to be harmed 
based upon all of the factors described above  we have a limited ability to forecast the amount and mix of future revenues and expenses and it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in the event that operating results are below our estimates or other expectations  the price of our common stock could decline 
if we fail to grow revenue from international operations and expand our international operations our business would be seriously harmed 
our total revenues derived from sales outside north america were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements success in increasing revenues from international sales 
we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets 
in order to expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international resellers and increase the productivity of existing international resellers 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
if we do not successfully expand our distribution channels and develop and maintain relationships with oems  our business would be seriously harmed 
to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as our oems  resellers and systems integrators 
our revenues from license fees resulting from sales through indirect channel partners were approximately  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on the success of our sales force in further establishing and maintaining relationships with indirect channel partners 
in particular  a significant element of our strategy is to embed our technology in products offered by oems for resale or as a hosted application to such oems customers and end users 
we also intend to establish and expand our relationships with resellers and systems integrators so that such resellers and systems integrators will increasingly recommend our products to their clients 
our future success will depend on the ability of our indirect channel partners to sell and support our products 
if the sales and implementation cycles of our indirect channel partners are lengthy or variable or our oems experience difficulties embedding our technology into their products or we fail to train the sales and customer support personnel of such indirect channel partners in a timely or effective fashion  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
although we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to expand and develop relationships with oems  we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining these relationships 
if we are unable to successfully expand this distribution channel and secure license agreements with additional oems on commercially reasonable terms  including significant up front payments of minimum license fees  and extend existing license agreements with existing oems on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results would be harmed 
any inability by us to maintain existing or establish new relationships with indirect channel partners  including systems integrators and resellers  or  if such efforts are successful  a failure of our revenues to increase correspondingly with expenses incurred in pursuing such relationships  would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
our market is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving standards and product releases by our competitors that are marketed to compete directly with our products 
our competition comes in four principal forms competition from current or future business intelligence software vendors such as business objects  cognos  hyperion  information builders  and microstrategy  which offer enterprise reporting products  competition from other large software vendors such as ibm  microsoft  oracle and sap  to the extent they include reporting functionality with their applications or databases  competition from other software vendors and software development tool vendors  and competition from the it departments of current or potential customers that may develop scalable enterprise reporting applications internally  which may be cheaper and more customized than our products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sales of their products than we may 
also  most current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and the ability to leverage a significant installed customer base 
these companies have released and can continue to release competing enterprise reporting software products or significantly increase the functionality of their existing reporting software products  either of which could result in a loss of market share for us 
we expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the enterprise reporting application market and new products and technologies are introduced 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers 
also our current or future channel partners may have established in the past  or may in the future  establish cooperative relationships with our current or potential competitors  thereby limiting our ability to sell our products through particular distribution channels 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could reduce our revenues from license fees and services from new or existing customers on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
we have been subject to infringement claims in the past and we expect companies in the business intelligence software market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and or competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and expenses  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the market for enterprise reporting application software does not grow as we expect  our business would be seriously harmed 
the market for enterprise reporting application software products is still emerging and we cannot be certain that it will continue to grow or that  even if the market does grow  businesses will purchase our products 
if the market for enterprise reporting application software products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
to date  all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our enterprise reporting software and related products and services  and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers and indirect channel partners about enterprise reporting applications and our products 
however  if such expenditures do not enable our products to achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
because the sales cycles of our products are lengthy and variable  our quarterly results may fluctuate 
the purchase of our products by our end user customers for deployment within the customer s organization typically involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources  and is therefore subject to delays that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements are beyond our control 
these delays can arise from a customer s internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  budgetary constraints  the testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations and general economic and political events 
the sales cycle for initial orders and larger follow on orders for our products can be lengthy and variable 
additionally  sales cycles for sales of our products to oems tend to be longer  ranging from to months or more and may involve convincing the vendor s entire organization that our products are the appropriate software for the vendor s application 
this time period does not include the sales and implementation cycles of such vendor s own products  which can be longer than our sales and implementation cycles 
certain of our customers have in the past  or may in the future  experience difficulty completing the initial implementation of our products 
any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation by our end user customers or our indirect channel partners could cause such customers to reject our software or lead to the delay or non receipt of future orders for the large scale deployment of our products 
if we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  our stock price could be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  our management is required to report on  and our independent auditors are required to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis 
our assessment  testing and evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has not yet been completed 
there can be no assurance that as a result of completing our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting  we will not identify any additional material weaknesses or that such evaluation will be completed by the end of the day extension period accorded to us under the sec s exemption order in sec release no 
to date  as a result of this testing  we identified a material weakness  which has been remediated subsequent to december   as described in item a below 
we will include our management s report and our auditor s report on internal control over financial reporting in an amendment to this form k within such day period 
we know that  upon completion of our evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting  kpmg llp will issue an adverse opinion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if in future periods we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective  we may be required to change our internal control over financial reporting to remediate deficiencies  and investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  causing our stock price to decline 
section and other recently enacted regulatory changes have caused us to incur increased costs and operating expenses and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and directors 
the sarbanes oxley act of and recently enacted rules of the sec and nasdaq have caused us to incur significant increased costs as we implement and respond to new requirements 
in particular  the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting under section are new and complex  and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation 
this ongoing process of reviewing  documenting and testing our internal controls over financial reporting has resulted in  and will likely continue to result in  a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
furthermore  achieving and maintaining compliance with sarbanes oxley and other new rules and regulations has required us to hire additional personnel and has and will continue to require us to use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
any acquisitions made by us will also put a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
in addition  any expansion of our international operations will lead to increased financial and administrative demands associated with managing our international operations and managing an increasing number of relationships with foreign partners and customers and expanded treasury functions to manage foreign currency risks  all of which will require implementation of any changes necessary to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting 

table of contents 
index to financial statements any failure to satisfy the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or as executive officers 
we may make future acquisitions  which involve numerous risks 
our business is highly competitive  and as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and expand our distribution channels and professional services organization 
one of the ways we have addressed and will continue to address these issues are through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following the possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition  difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies  difficulties in retaining key relationships with customers  partners and suppliers of the acquired company  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  negative impact to our financial condition and results of operations and the potential write down of impaired goodwill and intangible assets resulting from combining the acquired company s financial condition and results of operations with our financial statements  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and we cannot be certain that any acquisition will be successful and will not materially harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands  and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to support current and future releases of popular operating systems and computer programming languages  databases and software applications  to timely develop new products that achieve market acceptance and to meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
if the announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors or any change in industry standards causes customers to defer or cancel purchases of existing products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
as a result of the complexities inherent in enterprise reporting applications  major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the general availability of new or enhanced versions of our products 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to successfully develop  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements or such new products and product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we do not release new products and enhancements to existing products in a timely manner or if such new products and enhancements including our open source project fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be seriously harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on the success of new products and enhancements to our products that we make generally available 
prior to the release of any new products or enhancements  the products must undergo a long development and testing period 
to date  the development and testing of new products and enhancements have taken longer than expected 
in the event the development and testing of new products and enhancements continue to take longer than expected  the release of new products and enhancements will be delayed 
if we fail to release new products and enhancements in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
in addition  if such new products and enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
in the third quarter of we announced a new open source initiative 
we are developing a business intelligence reporting tools birt open source code project as part of the eclipse open source code foundation 
the first version of birt is expected to be available in we hope that birt will be widely adopted by java developers and will result in such developers recommending to their companies that they license our commercially available products 
if we fail to release birt in a timely manner  if birt does not achieve market acceptance and result in promoting sales of commercially available products our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
our international operations are subject to significant risks 
a substantial portion of actuate s revenues is derived from international sales 
international operations are subject to a number of risks  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
these risks include the following economic and political instability  including war and terrorism or the threat of war and terrorism  difficulty in managing an organization spread across many countries  multiple and conflicting tax laws and regulations  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  difficulty in hiring employees and high costs associated with terminating employees in foreign countries  trade laws and business practices favoring local competition  dependence on local vendors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  weaker intellectual property protection in foreign countries and potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy or misappropriation  longer sales cycles  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  the significant presence of some of our competitors in certain international markets  greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that  over time  an increasing portion of our revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent such denomination in foreign currencies does occur  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
although we may in the future decide to undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure  we currently do not attempt to cover any foreign currency exposure 
if we are not successful in any future foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lose the service of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  we have relied on our ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent 
recent accounting regulations  which will take effect in the third quarter  requiring the expensing of stock options  will impair our future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies  or the interpretation of existing accounting principles  can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows software revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  accounting for business combinations and related goodwill  and accounting for stock based compensation provided to employees 
our earnings may be adversely affected due to recent changes in the accounting rules governing the recognition of stock based compensation expense 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which we generally do not record compensation expense related to employee stock options in our financial statements 
however  in accordance with sfas and sfas  we provide additional disclosures of our operating results in the notes to our financial statements as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting 
had we accounted for our stock based compensation expense for employees in our results of operations under the fair value method of accounting prescribed by 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sfas  the compensation charges would have been significantly higher than the intrinsic value method used by us resulting in a reduction of net income or increase in net loss of approximately  million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will be required to adopt sfas r starting in our third fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r to have a significant adverse impact on our net income or loss and our net income or loss per share by decreasing our income or increasing our losses by the additional amount of such stock option charges 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact and cannot quantify the amount of such significant adverse impact at this time 
we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability 
while we were marginally profitable in our most recent fiscal year  we incurred net losses during fiscal year and our ability to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis will be affected by changes in our business 
we expect our operating expenses to increase as our business grows  and we anticipate that we will make investments in our business 
therefore  our results of operations will be harmed if our revenues do not increase at a rate equal to or greater than increases in our expenses or are insufficient for us to sustain profitability 
if we overestimate revenues  we may be unable to reduce our expenses to avoid or minimize a negative impact on our results of operations 
our revenues are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
our estimates of sales trends may not correlate with actual revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
variations in the rate and timing of conversion of our sales prospects into actual licensing revenues could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and those variations could adversely affect our financial results 
in particular  delays  reductions in amount or cancellation of customers purchases would adversely affect the overall level and timing of our revenues and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  many of our expenses  such as office and equipment leases and certain personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any period 
if our product contains material defects  our revenues may decline 
software products as complex as those offered by us often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced  when new versions or enhancements are released and when configured to individual customer computing systems 
we currently have known errors and defects in our products 
despite testing conducted by us  if additional defects and errors are found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipment  this could result in the loss of revenues or a delay in market acceptance 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
although license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such limitation of liability provisions may not be effective as a result of existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions 
the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of such claims  which are likely to be substantial in light of the use of our products in business critical

a product liability claim brought against us could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the protection of our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have a small number of issued and pending us patents expiring at varying times ranging from to we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
for example  we license our software pursuant to shrink wrap or signed license agreements that impose certain restrictions on licensees ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property  including by requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we take precautions to protect our software  documentation  and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
if our means of protecting our proprietary rights is not adequate or our competitors independently develop similar technology  our business could be seriously harmed 
our common stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
the market price of shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in the economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad  terrorist attacks  war or the threat of terrorist attacks and war  the announcement of mergers or acquisitions by us or our competitors  developments in ongoing or threatened litigation  announcements of technological innovations  failure to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  new products or new contracts announced by us or our competitors  developments with respect to copyrights or proprietary rights  price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  changes in corporate purchasing of enterprise reporting application software  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry including stock option expensing roles  and changes in financial estimates by securities analysts 
in addition  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against such company 
if we are involved in such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition

index to financial statements changes in tax rates or negative tax rulings could adversely impact our financial results we are taxable principally in the united states and certain jurisdictions in europe and asia pacific 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate income tax rates and other income tax laws  which could increase our future income tax provision 
while we believe that all material income tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
future levels of research and development spending will impact our entitlement to related tax credits  which generally lower our effective income tax rate 
future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have statutory tax rates lower than in the united states 
certain of our charter provisions and delaware law  may prevent or deter a change in control of actuate 
actuate s certificate of incorporation  as amended and restated the certificate of incorporation  and bylaws  as amended and restated bylaws  contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of actuate or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder might consider favorable  including provisions authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock and eliminating the ability of stockholders to act by written consent 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
the anti takeover effect of these provisions may also have an adverse effect on the public trading price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during fiscal years  and  we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
in  the majority of the revenues generated outside of north america were denominated in foreign currencies 
our exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies is limited 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country and may result in a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal years   and was not material 
actuate does not engage in hedging transactions 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
