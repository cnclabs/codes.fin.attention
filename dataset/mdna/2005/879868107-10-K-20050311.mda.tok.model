item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include general economic  market  or business conditions  the opportunities or lack thereof that may be presented to and pursued by us  the availability and price of raw materials we use  competitive actions by other companies  changes in laws or regulations or actions or restrictions of regulators  and the accuracy of our judgments and estimates concerning the integration of acquired operations and our consolidation and supply chain initiatives  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results of operations for the years  and summary our mission is to be the best by consistently exceeding customer expectations  maximizing asset utilization  lowering operating costs and improving efficiency 
we are a market driven  customer focused company 
our three key strategies are focusing on corrugated packaging from an integrated platform  which eliminates downtime and lowers costs through improved asset utilization  maximizing the value of our timberland through accelerated fiber growth that is aligned with well located converting operations and developing significant real estate opportunities on high value land  and realizing earnings and cash flow from financial services  which is a low cost  low risk provider of financial services 
actions we took in to implement our key strategies included we closed five corrugated packaging converting facilities and sold our specialty packaging operations and our clarion  pennsylvania mdf facility to reduce costs and improve asset utilization 
these actions affected over employees 
we are modifying and enhancing two of our linerboard mills to increase mill reliability and reduce reliance on natural gas as an energy source 
we repositioned our mortgage origination activities and sold our third party mortgage servicing portfolio to reduce costs and exposure to changing market conditions  including a slow down in refinancing activity 
while we will still originate mortgage loans for our own portfolio and  to a lesser extent  for sale to others  we will limit our product offerings and reposition our retail origination activities 
these actions affected over  employees and resulted in the sale or closure of over of our mortgage origination outlets 

table of contents a summary of our consolidated results follows for the year in millions  except per share consolidated revenues income from continuing operations income from continuing operations per diluted share significant items affecting income from continuing operations included in  we began to see the benefits in our manufacturing operations of our initiatives to lower cost and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies 
in addition  market demand strengthened  resulting in higher prices for most of our forest products  and prices for corrugated packaging began to improve in the second quarter of the year 
our financial services operations benefited from improved asset quality  which resulted in a recovery of previously provided provisions for loan losses 
this was partially offset by declining mortgage origination activities 
actions taken to lower cost and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies resulted in charges and expenses of million  principally related to the converting and production facility closures and the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and sale of our third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
we also recognized a one time tax benefit of million resulting from the settlement of prior years tax examinations 
in  weak industry box demand and lower prices  continued excess capacity in most of our forest products  and higher energy and pension costs negatively affected our manufacturing revenues and earnings 
the negative effect was partially offset by improvements in financial services earnings 
actions taken to lower cost and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies resulted in charges and expenses of million principally related to the sale or closure of under performing assets and the consolidation of administrative functions 
we also recognized a one time tax benefit of million resulting from the resolution and settlement of prior years tax examinations 
in  anemic growth of the us economy coupled with industry over capacity for most forest products negatively affected our revenues and earnings 
we grew our corrugated packaging operations by acquiring gaylord  which we began consolidating in march  and we also acquired a box plant in puerto rico in march  certain assets of mack packaging group  inc in may  and fibre innovations llc in november 
in may  we sold million shares of common stock  million of upper decs sm units  and million of senior notes 
in the aggregate  these acquisitions and financing transactions significantly increased the assets and operations of our corrugated packaging segment and changed our capital structure 
business segments we manage our operations through three business segments corrugated packaging  forest products  and financial services 
our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates  new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities  loan collateral values  particularly real estate  and the strength of the us dollar 
given the commodity nature of our manufactured products  we have little control over market pricing or market demand 
corrugated packaging we manufacture linerboard and corrugating medium that we convert into corrugated packaging and sell in the open market 
our corrugated packaging segment revenues are principally derived from the sale of corrugated packaging products and  to a lesser degree  from the sale of linerboard in the domestic and export markets 

table of contents a summary of our corrugated packaging results follows for the year in millions revenues segment operating income due to the integration of the operations we acquired in  we cannot readily quantify the effect of these acquisitions on our operating income  but we believe it was significant 
the acquired operations contributed million in revenues in corrugated packaging shipments began to improve in second half and that trend continued in as a result of this improved demand and a generally improving us economy  the price of linerboard increased by in march with a corresponding increase in corrugated packaging prices effective april in june  the price of linerboard increased another per ton with a corresponding increase in corrugated packaging prices effective july year over year increase decrease corrugated packaging average prices shipments  average week a industry shipments  average week b linerboard average prices shipments  tons a a shipments are pro forma to reflect the acquisition of gaylord 
b source fibre box association about one percentage point of the increase in corrugated packaging shipments is attributable to growth in our converting operations in mexico 
linerboard sales and shipments to third parties were down because more of our production was used in our converting facilities  which is consistent with our strategy to convert more of the linerboard we produce in our own converting facilities 
we lowered cost and improved operating efficiency and asset utilization by closing eight converting facilities  five in and three in in addition we are spending capital on our mills to increase mill reliability and increase energy efficiency by lowering natural gas usage 
fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber recycled fiber energy  principally natural gas depreciation pension and postretirement our wood  recycled fiber and energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during 
table of contents the decrease in depreciation in was principally due to the sale or closure of converting facilities 
the increase in depreciation in was principally due to the facilities we acquired in information about our converting facilities and mills follows for the year number of converting facilities at year end mill capacity  in million tons mill production  in million tons percent mill production used internally percent of total fiber requirements sourced from recycled fiber corrugating medium purchases from our premier boxboard limited llc joint venture  in thousand tons forest products we own or lease two million acres of timberland in texas  louisiana  georgia  and alabama 
we grow timber  cut the timber and convert it into products 
we intend to create the infrastructure necessary for real estate development of our designated high value timberland in georgia  principally near atlanta 
we manufacture lumber  particleboard  gypsum wallboard  fiberboard and medium density fiberboard mdf 
our forest products segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of these products and  to a lesser degree  from sales of fiber and high value lands 
we also own percent interests in a gypsum wallboard joint venture and in an mdf joint venture 
a summary of our forest products results follows for the year in millions revenues segment operating income as a result of industry capacity closures and the strong housing and remodeling markets  product prices and shipments began to improve in the second half of and that trend continued in year over year increase decrease lumber average prices shipments particleboard average prices shipments gypsum average prices shipments mdf average prices shipments comparisons of mdf and particleboard shipments are affected by the indefinite closure of our clarion mdf facility in third quarter and the sale of this facility in second quarter and by the indefinite closure of our mt 
jewett particleboard facility in second quarter 
table of contents segment operating income includes our share of gypsum and mdf joint ventures operating income million in  million in  and a loss of million in the joint ventures operating results generally fluctuate in relation to the price and shipment changes noted above 
at year end  our high value timberland principally consisted of about  acres located in georgia  principally near atlanta 
information regarding our high value land sales follows year dollars in millions high value land acres sold profit included in segment operating income fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber energy  principally natural gas pension and postretirement our goal is to increase our use of wood fiber from our timberland and reduce our reliance on outside purchases 
our outside purchases of fiber and energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during information about our timber harvest and converting and manufacturing facilities follows for the year timber harvest  in million tons sawtimber pulpwood total number of converting and manufacturing facilities at year end average operating rates for all product lines high low average operating rates for all product lines excluding sold or closed facilities high low in and  we curtailed production in most product lines to varying degrees due to market conditions 
our joint venture operations also experienced production curtailments in and due to market conditions 
financial services we own a savings bank  guaranty bank  and an insurance agency and engage in real estate development activities 
in late  we repositioned our mortgage origination activities and sold our third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
guaranty makes up the predominant amount of our financial services segment operating income  revenues  assets  and liabilities 
in general  we gather funds from depositors  borrow money  and invest the resulting cash in loans and securities 

table of contents we focus our investing and deposit gathering activities in areas that promote a relatively stable source of earnings 
we attempt to minimize the potential effect of interest rate and credit quality cycles by investing principally in residential housing assets and maintaining an asset and liability profile that is relatively insensitive to movements in interest rates 
in general  we do not purchase or write derivative financial instrument contracts other than short term contracts to hedge mortgage loans that we intend to sell 
we focus our loan portfolio on products with collateral and rate characteristics that we have significant experience managing and principally invest in assets with variable rates or that reprice in three to five years 
our deposit gathering activities are focused in two primary markets  texas and california  both of which offer substantial opportunity for cost effective growth 
limiting the markets and products in which we participate and avoiding complex financial instruments allows us to limit our infrastructure costs  however  we do incur substantial costs to operate in a regulated environment and comply with the extensive laws and regulations to which guaranty is subject 
a summary of our financial services results follows for the year in millions net interest income segment operating income improvements in our net interest income and lower loan loss provisions were partially offset by declining values of our mortgage servicing rights  which we sold in late  and losses from mortgage origination activities  prior to the completion of our repositioning of these activities in late net interest income and earning assets and deposits in  our interest rate spread improved  partially due to repricing of maturing certificates of deposit at lower market rates 
in addition  we have continued our strategy of investing in residential housing loans  principally single family loans with fixed interest rates for the first three to five years and adjustable rates thereafter 
on average in  we increased transaction accounts and decreased certificates of deposit 
in general  transaction accounts cost us less than certificates of deposit 
as we are currently positioned  if interest rates remain relatively stable  it is likely that our net interest income will remain near its current level 
however  if interest rates change significantly  it is likely that our net interest income will decline 
in  our net interest spread decreased as a result of declining interest rates and continued strong competition for attracting deposits 
information concerning our interest rate spread follows for the year average yield average yield average yield balance rate balance rate balance rate dollars in millions earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread 
table of contents the following table summarizes the composition of our earning assets and deposits at year end in millions residential housing assets loans and securities other earning assets total earning assets residential housing assets as a percentage of earning assets transaction accounts certificates of deposit total deposits the decrease in earning assets was principally due to a decrease in single family mortgage backed securities resulting from reduced purchases coupled with prepayments related to refinancing activity and a decrease in multifamily and senior housing construction loans and commercial real estate loans resulting from repayments 
we expect this trend of repayments of commercial real estate loans to continue in early  but expect to begin to see increased funding on new loan commitments beginning in late as a result of the repositioning of our mortgage activities  we anticipate a substantial decrease in our mortgage loans held for sale beginning in early we experienced growth in other important components of our earning assets in  including million in longer term multifamily and senior housing term loans 
additionally loans to oil and gas producers and other participants in energy production and distribution activities  increased million in asset quality and allowance for loan losses a summary of various asset quality measures we monitor follows at year end dollars in millions non performing loans restructured operating lease assets foreclosed real estate non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets ratio allowance for loan losses non performing loans allowance for loan losses total loans we stop accruing interest on loans when we believe it is probable we will not collect all contractually due principal and interest 
we apply interest payments received on nonaccrual loans to reduce principal 
interest income we would have recognized on nonaccrual loans had they been performing in accordance with their contractual terms was not significant in any individual year 
however  in  we recognized million in interest income as a result of payoffs received on loans for which we had previously applied interest payments received to reduce the carrying amount 
at year end  we held a direct financing lease that had characteristics indicating potential problems 
the lease has a carrying value of million and is secured by equipment used to manufacture original equipment automotive parts 
the lessee is currently performing in accordance with the contractual terms  which have not been modified  but we have concerns about the lessee s ability to continue to comply with contractual terms because  in february  the lessee filed for bankruptcy protection 

table of contents virtually all of our commercial real estate loans are collateralized and performing in accordance with contractual terms 
however  the borrowers on approximately million of our senior housing and commercial real estate loans have completed construction and are nearing maturity of automatic or subsequently approved extensions 
we underwrote most of these loans with the expectation that the borrowers would secure permanent financing or sell the collateral before or upon maturity of our loan 
some of the borrowers with completed projects have not been able to achieve the lease up schedules originally anticipated 
although the current real estate environment is improving and we continue to receive a large number of payoffs on real estate loans  it is likely that we will extend some of these loans further 
we typically require loans to be current on all interest and other contractual payments to grant such extensions 
additionally  we generally require substantial third party guarantee or other credit support 
however  for some loans  permanent financing may be difficult for the borrowers to secure  and collateral sales may require longer marketing periods or may not be possible 
in  we foreclosed and sold collateral securing four real estate loans  resulting in charge offs and subsequent asset write downs of million 
it is possible that we will have to foreclose on additional commercial real estate loans in the future 
we believe our allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover probable losses 
factors that influence our judgments regarding the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the amounts charged to expense include conditions affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values for impaired loans  risk characteristics for groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired but we believe have probable potential losses  risk characteristics for homogeneous pools of loans  and other risk factors that we believe are not apparent in historical information 
the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses for the year dollars in millions balance at beginning of year net charge offs provision credit for loan losses transfer to reserve for loan commitments balance at end of year net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding the overall credit quality of our loans improved in because a number of large loans with previously identified weaknesses were paid in full or otherwise resolved  or in some cases we foreclosed on the underlying collateral 
as a result of the significant decline in non performing loans and other loans identified with weaknesses in our internal grading system  we recorded a credit to provision expense in of this credit provision  million related to paid in full real estate construction loans  million related to paid in full commercial and business loans  million related to upgrades of previously classified loans as a result of improving borrower and collateral characteristics  and million related to improvements in identified industry and economic trends and conditions 
charge offs in related principally to foreclosed real estate loans and several smaller asset based lending loans 
charge offs in related principally to two commercial real estate loans  two commercial and business loans  restructured aircraft leases  and several asset based lending loans 
charge offs in related principally to two senior housing loans  two commercial and business loans  and several asset based lending and leasing loans 
in  we restructured two leveraged direct financing leases on cargo aircraft in which we are the lessor 
due to a reduction in the lease payments  we reclassified the leases as operating leases  recorded the aircraft in our balance sheet and wrote them down to fair value 
we are depreciating the aircraft over their remaining expected useful lives 
the carrying value of the aircraft was million at year end the lessee entered 
table of contents into bankruptcy protection in  during which time we agreed to a further reduction in lease payments 
the lessee subsequently emerged from bankruptcy protection and continues to make lease payments in accordance with the terms 
although the lessee continues to make the contractual lease payments  it has not operated out of bankruptcy for a sufficient time for us to determine whether it will likely be able to continue to make payments for the remaining five years of the lease term 
the reduction in lease payments did not give rise to an impairment charge 
repositioning of mortgage origination activities and sale of third party mortgage servicing in third quarter  we announced our intentions to reposition our mortgage origination activities and sell our third party mortgage servicing portfolio to reduce costs and our exposure to changing market conditions  including a slow down in refinancing activity 
while we will still originate mortgage loans for our own portfolio and  to a lesser extent  for sale to others  we intend to limit our product offerings and reposition our retail origination activities 
we will continue to originate loans through brokers and correspondent networks and in certain retail channels  including the retail branches of guaranty 
at year end  we had substantially completed the repositioning of the mortgage origination activities and sold our third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
as a result of these actions  we incurred million in charges and expenses  including million of severance  million related to the closure of facilities  and an million loss on the sale of the third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
non interest income and non interest expenses fluctuations in our non interest income and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest income loan origination and sale of loans servicing rights amortization and impairment real estate operations the decrease in loan origination and sale of loans was due principally to the decline in mortgage loan origination activity as refinancing slowed considerably in and to the sale and closure of many of our mortgage loan origination branches in late the changes in servicing rights amortization and impairment were principally due to fluctuations in mortgage interest rates and the decision to sell the third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
as mortgage interest rates rise  mortgage origination activity and servicing rights amortization and impairment generally decline  and as mortgage interest rates decline  mortgage loan origination activity and servicing rights amortization and impairment generally increase 
the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and the sale of our third party mortgage servicing portfolio will substantially reduce future loan origination and sale of loans income and servicing rights amortization and impairment 
at year end  we had no remaining mortgage servicing rights on our balance sheet 
year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest expense compensation and benefits real estate operations a significant portion of our compensation expense was related to our mortgage loan origination activity and was directly variable with origination activities 
the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities will substantially reduce these costs  as well as make our compensation costs less sensitive to mortgage loan origination volume 
real estate operations expense increased in and then decreased in because a multifamily housing development partnership that we consolidate completed construction in and began 
table of contents operating the property while marketing it for sale 
the partnership sold the property in real estate operations revenues  however  did not decline in because revenues from lot sales increased 
information regarding our mortgage loan origination activities follows for the year dollars in millions loans originated and retained loans originated for sale to third parties gains on loan sales as a percent of originations value of mortgage servicing rights retained in the past  we retained the rights to service some of the loans we sold to third parties  but did not retain any other interests in those loans 
in the future  we do not anticipate retaining a significant amount of mortgage servicing rights on loans we sell to third parties 
for additional statistical and financial information about our financial services segment  see statistical data at the end of this item 
expenses not allocated to segments unallocated expenses represent expenses managed on a company wide basis and include corporate general and administrative expense  other operating and non operating income expense  and parent company interest expense 
the change in general and administrative expenses in and was principally due to increases in stock based compensation and pension costs and  in  to million in expenses related to our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of we started expensing stock options using the fair value method in  and we used treasury stock to fund our k matching contributions in and stock based compensation was million in  million in  and million in other operating income expense consists of in  million  including an million charge associated with consolidation of administrative functions and supply chain initiatives  million related to closure or sale of converting facilities and non strategic assets and million of other charges 
of these amounts  million applies to corrugated packaging  million to forest products  and million is unallocated 
in addition  financial services recognized a million charge related to the repositioning of the mortgage origination activities and the third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
in  million  including a million charge associated with consolidation of administrative functions and supply chain initiatives  million related to the closure or sale of converting and production facilities and non strategic assets and million of other charges 
of these amounts  million applies to corrugated packaging  million to forest products and million is unallocated 
in addition  financial services recognized a million charge associated with workforce reductions 
in  million related to the repurchase of notes sold with recourse  which applies to corrugated packaging 
in addition  financial services recognized a million charge related to severance and write off of technology investments 
the consolidation of our administrative functions has been completed  but we expect the improvements in supply chain to be ongoing 
the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and third party mortgage servicing portfolio is essentially completed 
we will continue our efforts to enhance return on investment by lowering cost  improving operating efficiencies and increasing asset utilization 
as a result  we will continue to review operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determine appropriate courses of action  including consolidating and closing converting facilities and selling under performing assets 

table of contents other non operating income expense includes call premiums and write offs of unamortized financing fees related to early repayments of borrowings of million in  million in and million in  and million of interest income in the change in parent company interest expense was due to reductions in long term debt and lower interest rates 
at year end  we had  million of debt with fixed interest rates that averaged percent and million of debt with variable interest rates that averaged percent 
this compares with  million of debt with fixed interest rates that averaged percent and million of debt with variable interest rates that averaged percent at year end income taxes our effective tax rate was a tax expense of percent in  a tax benefit of percent in  and a tax expense of percent in these rates reflect one time benefits of eight percent in and percent in resulting from the resolution of tax examinations and claims discussed below 
other differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate are due to state income taxes  nondeductible items  foreign operating losses  and other items for which we recognize no financial benefit until realized 
in  the internal revenue service concluded its examination of our tax returns for the years through  and we resolved several state income tax examinations 
in  the internal revenue service concluded its examination of our tax returns through  including matters related to net operating losses and minimum tax credit carryforwards  which resulted from certain deductions following the acquisition of guaranty and for which no financial accounting benefit had been recognized 
also in  we resolved certain state tax refund claims for the years through as a result  valuation allowances and tax accruals previously provided for these matters were no longer required  and in fourth quarter we recognized a one time benefit of million or per diluted share  and in second quarter we recognized a one time benefit of million or per diluted share 
of these one time benefits  million represents cash refunds of previously paid taxes plus related interest in and million in the remainder was a non cash benefit 
based on our current expectations of income and expense  it is likely that our effective tax rate will approximate percent 
we do not expect the american jobs creation act of to affect our effective tax rate significantly 
average shares outstanding the changes in average diluted shares outstanding in and were primarily the result of our may sale of million shares of common stock 
the change in was primarily the result of exercise of employee stock options 
the dilutive effect of our outstanding stock options and equity purchase contracts was not significant 
the expected settlement of our equity purchase contracts in may will result in the issuance of between million and million shares of our stock  and we will receive million in cash 
on february   we announced that our board of directors approved i a repurchase program of up to six million shares  or over  of our common stock  and ii a for stock split to be distributed on april  capital resources and liquidity for the year we discuss our capital resources and liquidity for temple inland and our manufacturing subsidiaries  which we refer to as the parent company  and our financial services subsidiaries separately in order for the reader to better understand our different businesses and because almost all of the net assets invested in financial services are subject  in varying degrees  to regulatory rules and regulations including restrictions on the payment of dividends to the parent company 
sources and uses of cash consolidated cash from operations was million in  million in  and million in consolidated cash from operations represents the sum of parent company and financial services cash

we operate in cyclical industries and our operating cash flows vary accordingly 
our principal operating cash requirements are for compensation  wood and recycled fiber  energy  interest and taxes 
in  we experienced improved pricing and shipments for most of our products compared with decreases experienced during most of the dividends we receive from financial services are dependent on its level of earnings and capital needs and are subject to regulatory approval and restrictions 
it is likely that dividends from financial services will be substantially less in than in because of an anticipated increase in its capital requirements to support growth in its earning assets 
working capital is subject to cyclical operating needs  the timing of collection of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses and to a lesser extent to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
in and late  many of our employees took advantage of the increasing spread between the market price of our common stock and the exercise price of employee stock options and exercised their stock options 
as a result  we issued  shares of common stock in and  shares in to employees exercising options 
we sold  shares of common stock in in conjunction with the acquisition of gaylord 
debt reductions in included million of notes  million of to notes  and million of other long term liabilities  principally timber rights purchase obligations 
debt reductions in included million of debentures 
we paid cash dividends to shareholders of in including a per share special dividend in december  in  and in 
table of contents capital expenditures were of depreciation in and in capital expenditures are expected to approximate million in  of expected depreciation 
most of the and planned expenditures relate to initiatives to increase reliability and efficiency at our linerboard mills 
financial services sources and uses of cash for the year in millions we received cash from operations changes in loans held for sale  and other from operations sale of non strategic assets and mortgage servicing rights total sources we used cash to pay dividends to the parent company a change in deposits and borrowings reinvest in the business through loans and securities  net of payments capital expenditure  acquisitions and other uses total uses change in cash and cash equivalents a dividends we pay to the parent company are eliminated in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal operating cash requirements are for compensation  interest  and taxes 
changes in loans held for sale are subject to the timing of the origination and subsequent sale of the loans and the level of refinancing activity 
as a result of the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities in late  it is likely that the cash flow related to these activities will decrease substantially in  following positive cash flow in early from the sale of loans originated in the changes in deposits and borrowings and the amounts invested in loans  including loans held for sale  and securities generally move in tandem because we use deposits and borrowings to finance these investments 
fluctuations over the last several years are principally due to the changes in the volume of refinancing activities  and in  were also a result of a mortgage backed security investment initiative 
it is likely that we will increase our earning assets in  which in turn will increase our capital requirements 
we expect the increase in capital can be achieved from normal operations 
as a result  it is likely that we will pay substantially lower dividends to the parent company in than in additionally  in early  we completed the acquisition of an insurance agency for million cash 
this acquisition will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
liquidity and contractual obligations almost all of the net assets invested in financial services are subject  in varying degrees  to regulatory rules and restrictions including restrictions on the payment of dividends to the parent company 
as a result  all consolidated assets are not available to satisfy all consolidated liabilities 
for the reader to better understand this and our different businesses  we discuss our contractual obligations for the parent company and financial 
table of contents services separately 
at year end  our consolidated contractual obligations separated between the parent company and financial services consist of payments due or expiring by year total thereafter in millions parent company long term debt contractual interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations less  related municipal bonds we own operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total parent company financial services transaction and savings deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb borrowings  repurchase agreements and other borrowings preferred stock issued by subsidiaries contractual interest operating leases total financial services total consolidated parent company liquidity and contractual obligations our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  dividends received from financial services  and borrowings under our existing accounts receivable securitization program and committed credit agreements 
at year end  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in unused borrowing capacity 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be repaid from our operating cash flow or from our unused borrowing capacity 
we had million available under our million accounts receivable securitization program that expires in under this program  a wholly owned subsidiary purchases  on an on going basis  substantially all of our trade receivables 
as we need funds  the subsidiary draws under its revolving credit agreement  pledges the trade receivables as collateral  and remits the proceeds to us 
in the event of liquidation of the subsidiary  its creditors would be entitled to satisfy their claims from the subsidiary s pledged receivables prior to distributions back to us 
we included this subsidiary in our parent company and consolidated financial statements 
we have million available  out of a total of million  under committed credit agreements 
this includes a million credit agreement of which million expires in and million in the remaining million of credit agreements expire at varying dates in and our debt agreements  accounts receivable securitization program  and credit agreements contain terms  conditions and financial covenants customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage 
at year end  we complied with the terms  conditions and financial covenants 
none are restricted as to availability based on our long term debt ratings 

table of contents in february  we effected a successful remarketing of our million senior notes payable in the interest rate on these notes is now percent 
we expect to settle the related equity purchase contracts in may at that time  we will issue common stock in exchange for million in cash 
the actual number of shares we will issue will be based on the average market price of our stock  subject to a floor of  in which case we would issue million shares before taking into account the stock split discussed below  and a ceiling of  in which case we would issue million shares before taking into account the stock split discussed below 
on february   our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate to per share from per share  authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of common stock and declared a two for one stock split to be distributed on april  at that time  per share and share information will be restated to reflect the stock split 
in the s  we entered into two sale lease back transactions of production facilities with municipalities 
we entered into these transactions to mitigate property and similar taxes associated with these facilities 
the municipalities purchased the mills from us for million  our carrying value  and we leased the facilities back from the municipalities under lease agreements  which expire in and concurrently  we purchased million of interest bearing bonds issued by these municipalities 
the bond terms are identical to the lease terms  are secured by payments under the capital lease obligations  and the municipalities are obligated only to the extent the underlying lease payments are made by us 
the interest rate implicit in the leases is the same as the interest rate on the bonds 
as a result  the present value of the capital lease obligations is million  the same as the principal amount of the bonds 
since there is no legal right of offset  the million of bonds are included in other assets and the million present value of the capital lease obligations are included in other long term liabilities 
there is no net effect from these transactions as we are in substance both the obligor on  and the holder of  the bonds 
operating leases represent pre tax obligations and include million for the lease of particleboard and mdf facilities in mt 
jewett pennsylvania  which expire in the rest of our operating lease obligations are for timberland  facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations are pre tax  market priced obligations principally for gypsum and timber used in our manufacturing and converting processes and for major committed capital expenditures 
we have other long term liabilities  principally defined benefit pension and postretirement medical obligations and deferred income taxes  that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities 
at year end  the pre tax pension liability was million and the pre tax postretirement medical liability was million 
see pension  postretirement medical and health care matters for information about our pension and postretirement plans 
we do not expect any significant changes in our deferred tax liability in however  it is possible that by the end of we will have used all our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
as a result  it is possible that in and thereafter  we will pay federal income taxes at a rate as compared with the rate we have paid for a number of years 
while we have not completed the analysis of the repatriation of foreign earnings provisions of the american jobs creation act of  it is likely that any foreign earnings we would repatriate would not be significant 
we have interest rate and commodity derivative instruments outstanding at year end the interest rate instrument expires in and the majority of the commodity instruments expire in these instruments are non exchange traded and are valued using either third party resources or models 
at year end  the aggregate fair value of all derivatives was a million liability of which million relates to the interest rate swap and an insignificant asset relates to the two commodity instruments 
financial services liquidity and contractual obligations our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  new deposits  borrowings under our existing agreements and  if necessary  sales of assets 
assets that can be readily converted to cash  or against which we can readily borrow  include short term investments  loans  mortgage loans held for sale  and securities 
at year end  we had available liquidity of billion 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be repaid from operating cash flow and retention of our deposit customers 

table of contents our transaction and savings deposit accounts are shown as maturing in these accounts do not have a contractual maturity  but rather  are due on demand 
most of the certificates of deposit that mature in are short term one year or less and a high percentage of the depositors have historically renewed at maturity  although they have no contractual obligation to do so 
unless renegotiated  the terms of the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries make it likely that we will redeem the preferred stock in at the liquidation preference amount of million 
loans and securities aggregating billion are pledged as collateral on fhlb borrowings 
based upon this collateral  we have the ability to borrow an additional billion from the fhlb  which is included in our available liquidity 
operating lease obligations are principally for facilities and equipment 
off balance sheet arrangements parent company it is not our practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time  however  we do so to facilitate our operating activities 
at year end  our off balance sheet arrangements consisted of expiring by year total thereafter in millions joint venture guarantees performance bonds and recourse obligations total we participate in three joint ventures engaged in manufacturing and selling paper and forest products 
our partner in each of these ventures is a publicly held company unrelated to us 
at year end  these ventures had million in long term debt  of which we had guaranteed debt service obligations and letters of credit aggregating million 
our joint venture partners have provided similar guarantees and letters of credit 
generally we would be called upon to fund the guarantees due to the lack of specific performance by the joint ventures  such as non payment of debt 
performance bonds are primarily for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have also guaranteed the repayment of million of borrowings by a financial services subsidiary 
in addition  preferred stock issued by two subsidiaries of guaranty is automatically exchanged into preferred stock of guaranty upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events or administrative actions 
if such exchange occurs  these preferred shares are automatically surrendered to us in exchange for our senior notes  which may be redeemed by us 
at year end  the outstanding preferred stock issued by these two subsidiaries totaled million 
financial services we enter into commitments to extend credit for loans  leases  and letters of credit in the normal course of our business 
these commitments carry substantially the same risk as loans 
we generally require collateral upon funding of these commitments  the receipt of which provides assets that generally increase our liquidity by increasing our borrowing capacity 
these commitments normally include provisions allowing us to exit the 
table of contents commitment under certain circumstances 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements consist of expiring by year total thereafter in millions single family mortgage loans unused lines of credit unfunded portion of loan commitments other loan commitments letters of credit total capital adequacy and other regulatory matters at year end  guaranty met or exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
we expect to maintain guaranty s capital at a level that exceeds the minimum required for designation as well capitalized under the capital adequacy regulations of the office of thrift supervision ots 
from time to time  the parent company may make capital contributions to or receive dividends from guaranty 
selected financial and regulatory capital data for guaranty and its consolidated subsidiaries follows at year end in millions balance sheet data total assets total deposits shareholder s equity regulatory for categorization as actual minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tangible capital n a leverage capital risk based capital at year end  guaranty had outstanding preferred stock of subsidiaries with a carrying amount and liquidation value of million 
this preferred stock will be automatically exchanged into guaranty preferred stock if the ots determines guaranty is or will become undercapitalized in the near term or upon the occurrence of certain administrative actions 
if such an exchange were to occur  the parent company must issue senior notes in exchange for the guaranty preferred stock in an amount equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock exchanged 
with respect to certain of these shares  the parent company has the option to issue senior notes or purchase the shares 
at year end  million of the subsidiary preferred stock qualifies as core capital and the remainder qualifies as tier capital 
as we previously disclosed  an internal investigation revealed that guaranty s mortgage origination operation failed to file certain statutory reports on a timely basis and may have violated applicable laws and regulations 
we reported our findings and corrective actions to the ots 
after the ots reviewed the findings and corrective actions and conducted its own examination  it and guaranty entered into a stipulation and consent to the issuance of an order to cease and desist for affirmative relief consent order 
guaranty agreed to the issuance of the consent order  without admitting or denying any wrongdoing or relevant findings  in the interest of addressing the matters subject to the review and avoiding the cost and disruptions associated with possible administrative or judicial proceedings regarding those matters 
under the consent order  guaranty agreed  among other things  to take certain actions primarily related to its repositioned mortgage origination activities  including strengthening its regulatory compliance controls and management  
table of contents enhancing its suspicious activity reporting and regulatory training programs  and implementing improved risk assessment and loan application register programs 
no financial penalties were included in the consent order 
guaranty is in the process of completing implementation of these corrective actions and expects to have them in place by first quarter end as described earlier  guaranty has substantially completed the repositioning of its mortgage origination activities including the sale and closure of its retail mortgage origination outlets and has sold its third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
the consent order has no material on going impact on the operations of guaranty or its ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
we have not incurred any material financial loss as a result of this matter and have no reason to believe that the matters addressed in the consent order will result in any material loss to guaranty 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements and note a to the summarized financial statements of the parent company and financial services 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results  and they are difficult for us to apply 
within the parent company  they include asset impairments and pension accounting  and within financial services  they include the allowance for loan losses and  through  mortgage servicing rights 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that we have to make currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can and probably will be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have discussed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in our intentions  market conditions or operating performance could require us to revise the impairment charges we previously provided 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  currently percent  consideration is given to both historical returns and future returns over the next quarter century 
the actual rate of return on plan assets for the last ten years was percent 
differences between actual and expected returns will affect future pension expense 
for example  a basis point change in the estimated expected rate of return would affect annual pension costs by million 
in addition  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect the funded status by million and annual pension costs by million 
allowances for loan losses are based on historical experiences and evaluations of future cash flows and collateral values and are subject to regulatory scrutiny 
changes in general economic conditions or loan specific circumstances will inevitably change those evaluations 
measuring for impairment and amortizing mortgage servicing rights is largely dependent on our assumptions about the speed at which loans are repaid and market rates of return 
changes in interest rates affect both of these variables 
as a result of the sale of our third party mortgage servicing portfolio  beginning in  accounting for mortgage servicing rights will no longer be considered a critical accounting policy 
new accounting pronouncements adopted we have adopted a number of new accounting pronouncements  the more significant are described below 
unless noted otherwise  the effect on earnings or financial position of adopting the pronouncement was not material 

table of contents year financial accounting standards board fasb staff position  no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
we voluntarily began expensing stock options beginning with options granted in the effect of expensing stock options granted in was to reduce net income by million or per share 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires the recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets at their fair value and to allocate that fair value to expense over the useful life of the asset 
the effect of adopting this statement was to increase property  plant and equipment by million  recognize an asset retirement obligation liability of million  and reduce net income by million or per share for the cumulative effect of adoption 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
provisions of this statement addressing the accounting for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests have been deferred indefinitely pending further fasb action 
the deferred provisions would principally affect the way we account for minority interests in partnerships we control  the classification of such interests as liabilities  which we presently do  and accounting for changes in the fair value of the minority interest by a charge to earnings  which we currently do not do 
while the effect of the deferred provisions would be dependent on the changes in the fair value of the partnerships net assets  it is possible that the future effects could be significant 
because the minority interests are not readily marketable  it is difficult to determine their fair value  however  we believe the difference between the carrying value of the minority interests and their estimated fair value was not significant at year end and sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement provides for the disclosure of additional information about pension and postretirement plans 
year sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement provided new guidance for goodwill and other indefinitely lived assets including precluding the amortization of goodwill 
the effect of adopting this statement was to reduce net income by million or per diluted share for an million goodwill impairment associated with corrugated packaging pre acquisitions

sfas no 
and no 
will be effective for us beginning while sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning third quarter we have not yet completed our analysis of these pronouncements to determine what effects  if any  their adoption will have on our earnings or financial position 
however  the effects of sfas no 
r will be somewhat mitigated because we are already charging to expense over their vesting period the fair value of employee stock options granted in and our best estimate is that the effect on earnings and earnings per share of adopting sfas no 
r would approximate those disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement requires that any tax benefits we realize as a result of the exercise of employee stock options be reflected as a financing cash flow instead of an operating cash flow 
we recognized a million benefit in and less than a million benefit in and  which are included in our operating cash flow 
change in method of accounting for inventories beginning beginning first quarter  we will change our method of accounting for our corrugated packaging inventories from the lifo method to the average cost method  which approximates fifo 
as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce cost permanently and increase asset utilization  we believe the average cost method is preferable because it will i increase the transparency of our financial reporting through a more balanced income statement and balance sheet presentation  ii result in the valuation of all of our inventories at current cost in our financial statements  and iii conform all of our inventories to a single method of accounting 
as a result of this change  we expect that our january balance sheet will reflect an increase in inventories of million  an increase in income tax liability of million and an increase in retained earnings of million 
in addition  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we will retrospectively apply the average cost method to our prior years income statements and segment operating results  the expected effect of which is summarized as follows corrugated packaging income from segment operating income continuing operations per diluted share retrospective retrospective retrospective as reported application as reported application as reported application in millions  except per share year year year pension  postretirement medical and health care matters our non cash pension expense was million in  million in  and million in for the year  we expect our non cash pension expense to be million 
for accounting purposes  we measure the defined benefit plans projected benefit obligation  value the plan assets  and determine the funded status as of september of each year 
we measure our projected benefit obligation using current mortality tables and an appropriate discount rate 
at september  the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million in compared with million at september the change was principally due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate to percent partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets  percent compared with an expected rate of percent 
the pension liability recognized for accounting purposes was million at year end compared with million at year end unrecognized actuarial losses  which principally represent the delayed recognition of the effect of changes in the assumed discount rate and 
table of contents differences between expected and actual experience  were million at year end and million at year end these losses  to the extent they exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or plan assets  will be recognized prospectively over the remaining service period  currently estimated at nine years  and will be affected by further changes  if any  in the discount rate and differences between expected and actual experience 
we expect the amount to be recognized and included in pension expense will be about million  the same as included in pension expense 
for funding purposes  we determine the value of plan assets using a five year moving average as of january of each year 
our cash funding requirement was million in and we expect our cash funding requirement to be less than that in we made a voluntary  discretionary contribution of million to the defined benefit pension plan in fourth quarter and it is likely that we will make additional voluntary  discretionary contributions to the defined benefit plans in of million  million per quarter 
postretirement medical expense was million in  million in  and million in for accounting purposes we measure the projected benefit obligation using current mortality tables and an appropriate discount rate  currently percent 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was enacted in december this act expands medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
our postretirement benefit plans provide for medical coverage  including a prescription drug subsidy  for certain participants 
the effect of the act was to reduce the liability for postretirement medical cost by million and it is likely that it will reduce the postretirement medical expense by million 
effective january  we implemented a new consumer driven health plan option for our employees 
about percent of our employees elected this option 
we believe implementing this option will help mitigate our rising health care costs 
in  the total cost of providing health coverage was about million of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
energy and the effects of inflation energy costs increased million in  million in  and decreased million in  principally due to changes in natural gas prices 
our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the last three years 
our fixed assets  timber and timberland  are carried at their historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  depreciation expense and the cost of timber cut or timberland sold would be significantly higher than what we reported 
environmental protection our operations are subject to federal  state  and local provisions regulating discharges into the environment and otherwise related to the protection of the environment 
compliance with these provisions  requires us to invest substantial funds to modify facilities to assure compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
capital expenditures directly related to environmental compliance totaled million in this amount does not include capital expenditures for environmental control facilities made as a part of major mill modernizations and expansions or capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 
future expenditures for environmental control facilities will depend on new laws and regulations and other changes in legal requirements and agency interpretations thereof  as well as technological advances 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures for environmental purposes during the period through will average million each year  excluding expenditures related to the maximum achievable control technology mact programs and landfill closures discussed below 
the estimated expenditures could be significantly higher if more stringent laws and regulations are implemented 
on april  the epa issued extensive regulations governing air and water emissions from the pulp and paper industry cluster rule 
compliance with the mact phases of the cluster rule will be required at certain intervals through 
table of contents mact i standard the first phase of mact i covered the hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from low volume high concentration sources and pulp mill foul condensate streams at three containerboard mills 
compliance was required by april  and we spent million to meet the requirements of this rule 
the second phase of mact i covered hap emissions from high volume low concentration sources at three containerboard mills 
compliance is required by april  and we estimate we will spend million to meet these requirements 
the mact ii standard is for the control of hap emissions from pulp and paper mill combustion sources 
compliance was required by april and applies to three containerboard mills 
the total expenditures to comply with this standard associated with the reporting and record keeping activities for monitoring hap emissions were not significant 
the plywood and composite wood panel pcwp mact standards were published july   and also limit emissions of haps 
we have forest products facilities that will need to comply with this regulation by october  capital expenditures to comply with these standards are estimated at million 
we use company owned landfills for disposal of non hazardous waste at three containerboard mills and two forest products facilities 
based on third party cost estimates  we expect to spend  on an undiscounted basis  million over the next years to ensure proper closure of these landfills 
we are remediating a former creosote treating facility and one on site location obtained in the gaylord acquisition 
we expect the additional cost to remediate these sites  over a to year period  on an undiscounted basis will be million 
litigation matters we are involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
in our opinion  the possibility of a material loss from any of these proceedings is considered to be remote  and we do not expect that the effect of these proceedings will be material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
set forth below is a discussion of our most significant litigation matters 
antitrust litigation on may   inland  gaylord and eight other linerboard manufacturers were named as defendants in a consolidated class action complaint that alleged a civil violation of section of the sherman act 
inland and gaylord executed a settlement agreement on april   with the representatives of the class  which received final approval by the trial court 
gaylord and inland paid a total of million into escrow to fulfill the terms of the class action settlement 
twelve individual complaints containing allegations similar to those in the class action have been filed by certain opt out plaintiffs and over  of their named subsidiaries against the original defendants in the class action 
we believe that the plaintiffs allegations in the opt out litigation have no merit and are vigorously defending against the suits 
bogalusa litigation on october   a release of nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide took place at our linerboard mill in bogalusa  louisiana 
the mill followed appropriate protocols for handling this type of event  notifying the louisiana department of environmental quality  the us environmental protection agency and local law enforcement officials 
the federal and state environmental agencies have analyzed the reports we prepared and have not indicated that they will take any action against us 
to date  we have been served with seven lawsuits seeking damages for various personal injuries allegedly caused by either exposure to the released gas or fears of exposure 
these seven lawsuits have been consolidated but retain their individual status for trial purposes 
we intend to vigorously defend against these allegations as well as contest the proposed certification as a class action 
our internal analysis of the accident is continuing 

table of contents other litigation in  we formed guaranty then known as guaranty federal savings bank to acquire substantially all the assets and deposit liabilities of three thrift institutions from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation  as receiver of those institutions 
in connection with the acquisition  the government entered into an assistance agreement with us in which various tax benefits were promised 
in  congress enacted narrowly targeted legislation to eliminate a portion of the promised tax benefits 
we filed suit against the united states in the us court of federal claims alleging  among other things  that the legislation breached our contract and that we are entitled to monetary damages 
this lawsuit is currently in the discovery stage and is not expected to be resolved for several years 
we cannot predict the likely outcome of this litigation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current level of interest rate risk is primarily due to the lending and funding activities of our financial services segment 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate considers the effects of changing prepayment speeds  repricing characteristics and average balances over the next months 
increase decrease in income before taxes at year end at year end change in parent financial parent financial interest rates company services company services in millions we did not present a two percent interest rate decrease scenario because of the current low interest rate environment 
the analysis assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose to follow 
parent company interest rate risk is related to our long term debt and our interest rate swap 
because parent company debt is primarily fixed rate  interest rate changes are not expected to affect earnings significantly 
however  interest rate changes will affect the value of the interest rate swap agreements currently million notional amount 
we believe that any changes in value would not be significant 
our financial services segment is subject to interest rate risk to the extent interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repay or reprice at different times or in differing amounts or both 
our financial services segment s interest rate sensitivity has changed from year end  due principally to increases in market interest rates 
the rise in interest rates has resulted in an improved spread relationship between the yields on our earning assets and costs of funding sources  principally because our projected mortgage yields are benefiting from slower prepayments and our increase in deposit rates have lagged the increase in market rates 
further significant increases in market rates will not have the same effect as we believe our deposit rates would become more responsive to changes in market rates and prepayment rates on mortgages would not slow significantly 
foreign currency risk we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on our financial instruments because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of our volume and range in duration from three months to three years 
considering the fair value of these instruments at year end  we believe the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
