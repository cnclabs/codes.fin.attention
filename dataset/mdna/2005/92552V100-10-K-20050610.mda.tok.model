table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of advanced digital satellite communications and other wireless networking and signal processing equipment and services to the government and commercial markets 
based on our history and extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions  which enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a considerable share of the global satellite communications equipment and services segment of the broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for our government and commercial customers 
by developing cost effective communications products incorporating our advanced technologies  we have continued to grow the markets for our products and services 
our company is organized principally in two segments government and commercial 
our government business encompasses specialized products principally serving defense customers and includes tactical data links  including mids  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  and milsatcom systems and products  including uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  and innovative broadband solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity 
serving government customers with cost effective products and solutions continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
we have been increasing our focus in recent years on offering satellite based communications products and systems solutions to address commercial market needs 
in pursuing this strategy  we have acquired three strategic satellite communication equipment providers the satellite networks business of sa in fiscal year  comsat laboratories products business from lockheed martin in fiscal year  and usm in fiscal year our commercial segment accounts for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year  of our revenues in fiscal year  and of our revenues in fiscal year to date  our principal commercial offerings include vsat  broadband internet equipment over satellite  network control systems  network integration services  network operation services  gateway infrastructure  antenna systems and other satellite ground stations 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we won several important projects in the three key broadband markets enterprise  consumer and in flight mobile applications 
our commercial business offers an end to end capability to provide customers with a broad range of satellite communication and other wireless communications equipment solutions including consumer broadband products and solutions to customers based on docsis or dvb rcs based technology  mobile broadband products and systems for in flight  maritime and ground mobile broadband applications  enterprise vsat networks products and services  satellite networking systems design and technology development  mmic design and development  with an emphasis in systems engineering of packaged components  which specializes in high frequency communication technology design and development  and antenna systems for commercial and defense applications and customers 

table of contents with expertise in commercial satellite network engineering  gateway construction  and remote terminal manufacturing for all types of interactive communications services  we have the unique ability to take overall responsibility for designing  building  initially operating  and then handing over a fully operational  customized satellite network serving a variety of markets and applications 
to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target high technology satellite communication and other communication markets where the customer places a high priority on the solution  and obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining these awards 
our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  approximately for fiscal year  for fiscal year and for fiscal year  of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a stipulated price 
the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts  under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit  and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues are from contracts for the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the specific requirements of a customer s engineering and production order and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately of revenues during fiscal year  of revenues during fiscal year and of revenues during fiscal year as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
executive summary we develop and manufacture satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communications equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  we have been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support its business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to its competitors or peers 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
from through fiscal year  we were profitable and grew our revenue base each year 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry and the terrorist attacks in resulted in the loss of approximately one third of our backlog at the end of calendar year in the ensuing months  we began rebuilding our backlog first primarily in the government segment and then in the commercial segment as well 
while we were rebuilding backlog  we were also investing significantly in research and development of new products and new business activities 
while awards in fiscal year were a record at the time  it was the first year we did not grow our revenue on a year over year basis and were not profitable 
our awards have grown from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  to million in fiscal year and to million in fiscal year the awards growth each of the past 
table of contents three years and the conversion of certain of the awards has contributed to our revenue growth 
there are a number of large new business opportunities we are pursuing in fiscal year in the government segment  the opportunities include the mids lot vi production order  international mids orders  new mids joint tactical radio system contracts  additional funding for current information assurance projects  new information assurance contracts using our haipis technology  and orders for our new kg product 
in our commercial segment  the opportunities include new production orders for consumer and mobile broadband systems  new consumer broadband development systems  further penetration in the north american market with enterprise vsat customers and antenna systems 
the timing of these orders is not entirely predictable  so our revenue may vary somewhat from quarter to quarter or even year to year 
our operating objective for income from operations  excluding the deduction for amortization of intangible assets  is ten percent of revenues 
to the extent we are not generating sufficient gross profit from revenues  we strive to adjust other operating expenses to continue to attempt to meet this objective 
for the past three years we have not achieved our operating objective principally due to cost overruns on customer funded development programs  investments in research and development and increased selling expenses 
generating positive cash flows from operating activities was a financial priority for us in fiscal years and and will continue to be a focus in fiscal year key areas which we monitor to achieve the cash flow objective include generating income from operations  reducing our unbilled accounts receivable by monitoring program performance to ensure performance milestones are achieved  reducing the cycle time for amounts billed to customers and their related collection  and reducing inventory on hand 
we expect that our capital needs will increase for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as we expand our facilities  production test equipment and lab development equipment to meet customer program requirements and growth forecasts 
our facility needs have normally been met with long term lease agreements  but we do anticipate additional tenant improvements over the next two fiscal years associated with our expansion 
additionally  as our employee base increases  the need for additional computers and other equipment will also increase 
included in fiscal year operating cash flow is million received from sa and  in proceeds from the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of orbcomm 
operating income for fiscal year includes a benefit to cost of revenues of million and a benefit to selling  general and administrative expenses of million as a result of sa proceeds and a benefit to selling  general and administrative expenses of  from the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of orbcomm see liquidity section of our md a for more detail 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

table of contents revenue recognition a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over time and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting under the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
in the fiscal year ended april   we recorded losses of approximately million related to loss contracts 
there were no significant charges for loss contracts in fiscal years ended april  or march  assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
significant changes in estimates related to accounting for long term contracts may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the revised estimate is made 
the company also has contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products in accordance with sab  staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
the company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with eitf   accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
capitalized software development costs we charge costs of developing software for sale to research and development expense when incurred  until technological feasibility has been established 
software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility is reached until the product is available for general release to customers are 
table of contents capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
once the product is available for general release  we amortize the software development costs based on the ratio of current to future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to straight line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product not to exceed five years 
the determination of net realizable value involves judgment and estimates of future revenues to be derived from a product  as well as estimates of future costs of manufacturing that product 
we use our experience in the marketplace in making judgments in estimating net realizable value  but our estimates may differ from the actual outcome 
we periodically assess the assumptions underlying our estimates and  if necessary  we would adjust the carrying amount of capitalized software development costs downward to our new estimate of net realizable value 
we did not capitalize any costs related to software developed for resale in the fiscal years ended april  or april  we capitalized costs related to software developed for resale of million for the fiscal year ended march  amortization expense of software development costs was million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year these software development costs are included in other assets on the balance sheet and we record the related amortization expense as a charge to cost of revenues on the statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales has been to the us government 
more recently  commercial customers comprise a larger part of our revenues 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  warranty accrual we provide limited warranties on a majority of our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
we classify the amounts we expect to incur within twelve months as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failure that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
impairment of goodwill we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
the only reporting units which have goodwill assigned to them are the businesses which were acquired and have been included in our commercial segment 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting 
table of contents unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
in applying the first step  which is identification of any impairment of goodwill  no impairment of goodwill has resulted 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property and equipment and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we have not identified any such impairments 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of  was provided on deferred tax assets at april   for california research credit carryforward 
the amount of california research credit carryforward considered realizable was determined based on california taxable income and generation of additional california research credits projected in the future 
even though there is no expiration for california research credits  we are generating the credits at a rate faster than we expect to use them 
derivatives we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in investment income expense as gains losses on derivative instruments 
gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as gains losses on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction affects our earnings 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a liability of  at april  we had million of notional value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at april  we had no foreign currency forward or option contracts outstanding at april  and march

gross profit 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase april  april  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages gross profit percentage of revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the margin dollars generated from higher revenues and improved program performance in the government segment over fiscal year these increases were partially offset by gross profit reductions from higher than planned development and start up costs of our docsis based consumer satellite broadband system

selling  general and administrative expenses 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase april  april  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages selling  general and administrative percentage of revenues 
table of contents the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses year over year is primarily attributable to the increase in selling costs related to higher new contract awards and increased revenues  costs related to sarbanes oxley implementation of million  and higher year over year legal costs of approximately million

independent research and development 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase april  april  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages independent research and development percentage of revenues independent research and development ir d expenses have declined in each of the past two years compared to the prior year 
the decrease in ir d expenses reflects the reduced efforts for company funded development projects due to the increase of orders over the past months  where customer funded development was part of the contract  and the completion of the kg development during in fiscal year versus a full year in fiscal year amortization of intangible assets 
the intangible assets from acquisitions in fiscal year and in fiscal year are being amortized over useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets will decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized 
the estimated amortization expense of long lived intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease resulted from lower outstanding borrowings coupled with lower loan fees in fiscal year at april  and april   there were no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit

provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was a provision of in fiscal year compared to a benefit of in fiscal year we generate research credits that are not 
table of contents variable to income  so when there is a loss before tax as there was in fiscal year  the credits increase the tax benefit 
in fiscal year  we have income before tax so the tax credits reduce the tax provision

april  april  in millions firm backlog government segment commercial segment total funded backlog government segment commercial segment total contract options the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in 
table of contents fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
total new awards for both commercial and defense products were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer since orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related purchase order 
the backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing  equity financing and loans for the purchase of capital equipment 
the general cash needs of our government and commercial segments can vary significantly and depend on the type and mix of contracts ie product or service  development or production  timing of payments  etc 
in backlog  the quality of the customer ie  us government or commercial  domestic or international and the duration of the contract 
in addition  for both of our segments  program performance significantly impacts the timing and amount of cash flows 
if a program is performing and meeting its contractual requirements  then the cash flow requirements are usually lower 
the cash needs of the government segment tend to be more of a function of the type of contract rather than customer quality 
also  us government procurement regulations tend to restrict the timing of cash payments on the contract 
in the commercial segment  our cash needs are driven primarily by the quality of the customer and the type of contract 
the quality of the customer will typically affect the specific contract cash flow and whether financing instruments are required by the customer 
in addition  the commercial environment tends to provide for more flexible payment terms with customers  including advance payments 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million  the payment of k and performance bonuses of million in fiscal year  compared to zero in fiscal year  offset by cash provided by operations from increased profitability year over year 
cash flow from operating activities in fiscal year  included million received in the sa settlement see note contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
unbilled accounts receivable increased due to the higher level of mids production and the related progress payment process and the delay in achieving milestones primarily on information assurance  consumer broadband and enterprise vsat programs 
the increase in inventory was primarily related to mids and kg inventory as we increase production  and consumer and enterprise vsat equipment 
we expect both unbilled receivables and inventory to decline over the next two quarters 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in of million 
we acquired million in equipment in fiscal year compared to acquiring million in equipment in fiscal year 
table of contents cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in financing activities for fiscal year of million 
this increase for fiscal year was primarily the result of net cash payments of million on our line of credit in fiscal year  partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options

we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit principally related to contract performance leaving borrowing availability under our line of credit of million 
at april   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
on january   we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility the facility with union bank of california  comerica bank and silicon valley bank 
borrowings under the facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of million  including up to million of letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at our option  at either the lender s prime rate or at libor london interbank offered rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on the ratio of viasat s total funded debt to ebitda income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of viasat s personal property assets 
the facility contains financial covenants that set a minimum ebitda limit for the twelve month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter at million  a minimum tangible net worth as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at million and a minimum quick ratio sum of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and marketable securities  divided by current liabilities as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at to 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants at april  on october   we sent sa a claim for indemnification under the terms of the asset purchase agreement related to the acquisition of sa s satellite networks business satellite networks business in april on november   sa filed a complaint united states district court  northern district of georgia  atlanta division for declaratory judgment seeking to resolve our claim for indemnification through litigation 
in response to sa s complaint  on january   we filed a formal claim against sa for  among other things  fraud  breach of warranty  contractual and equitable indemnification  and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing 
in december  we reached an agreement with sa the sa settlement 
under the terms of the sa settlement  sa paid us million in cash and the parties jointly dismissed the litigation concerning the acquisition 
neither party admitted liability in connection with the litigation  or in the agreement resolving it 
as a result of the settlement  the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year includes benefits to cost of revenues of million and to selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
on january  we reached a settlement with astrolink with respect to contractual termination payments for contracts that were terminated on december  we received a cash payment of million 
the assets at risk prior to the astrolink settlement totaled million and included accounts receivable due from astrolink in the amount of approximately million  inventory specific to astrolink of million and million in prepaid airtime on astrolink satellites 
as a result  we recorded a charge through cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended march  of million 
on september  orbcomm global  lp and seven of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for chapter relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware as part of orbcomm s efforts to restructure and reorganize its business 
orbcomm has continued its efforts to maintain and operate its network of low earth orbit leo satellites and related ground facilities while it restructures its operations 
although discussions continued with orbcomm  we no longer considered it reasonably possible that our assets at risk would be recovered 
the amount at risk was accounts receivable of million  and a charge to selling  general and administrative costs was made for this amount and was included in our results for fiscal year ended march  in fiscal year we received  from the 
table of contents bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of orbcomm 
the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year includes a benefit to selling  general and administrative expenses of  for these proceeds 
in june we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the future sale of up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
additionally  viasat has available million of these securities  which were previously registered under a shelf registration statement viasat originally filed in september up to million of the securities may now be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities under the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the following table sets forth a summary of our obligations under operating leases  irrevocable letters of credit  purchase commitments and accrued warranty for the periods indicated for the fiscal years ending  total after in thousands operating leases standby letters of credit purchase commitments accrued warranty total we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
we are currently a party to various government and commercial contracts which require us to meet performance covenants and project milestones 
under the terms of these contracts  our failure meet such performance covenants and milestones permit the other party to terminate the contract and  under certain circumstances  recover liquidated damages or other penalties 
we are currently not in compliance or in the past were not in compliance with the performance or milestone requirements of certain of these contracts 
generally  our customers have not elected to terminate such contracts or seek liquidated damages from us  therefore  we have not accrued for any potential liquidated damages or penalties 
however  there can be no assurance that our customers will not elect to terminate such contracts or seek liquidated damages or penalties from us in the future

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement no 
sfas r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for sfas r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of sfas r will be effective for us in fiscal we will adopt the provisions of sfas r and plan to use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  sfas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas see stock based compensation in this note 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for stock based compensation using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will likely have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  the ultimate impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility costs  freight  handling costs and spoilage are to be recognized as current period expenses regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in arb no 
in addition  the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory is to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overhead costs are to be recognized as expenses in the period incurred 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
is a replacement of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors 
table of contents made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will be adopting this pronouncement beginning in our fiscal year on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which express the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provided the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issue under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no

r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas no 
r and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the impact sab will have on our results of operations and financial position when we adopt in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term obligations including the revolving line of credit 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
as of april   there is a foreign currency exchange contract outstanding which is intended to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in euros 
the foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of million  consisting of both a put contract and a call contract  had a fair value of a net liability of  as of april  the fair value of this foreign currency forward contract as of april   would have changed by  if the foreign currency exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar on this forward contract had changed by 
we had no foreign currency transactions outstanding at april
