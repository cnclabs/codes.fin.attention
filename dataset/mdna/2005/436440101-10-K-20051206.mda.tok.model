item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  inventories  investments  long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on management s estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for the company s products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
the company records provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of sales 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
our accounts receivable reserves were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the reserves in fiscal and were primarily attributable to our write off of reserves and accounts receivable related to financed sales in latin america  and for fiscal  a decrease to our bad debt expense 
revenue recognition revenue 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
generally  our product arrangements are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began accounting for these arrangements in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we have concluded that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered product has value to our customers on a stand alone basis and we have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of such services and undelivered products based on the consistency of prices charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  service revenue representing the fair value of services not yet performed at the time of product shipment is deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the fair value of the undelivered products is also deferred at the time of product shipment and recognized when these products are delivered 
the undelivered elements of service to be performed and products to be delivered are all probable  perfunctory in nature and under our control 
the residual revenue under the product arrangement will be recognized as product revenue upon shipment 
we adopted eitf as a cumulative effective of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board apb  accounting changes 
we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for shipments that require more than perfunctory obligations at the time of shipment  specifically for certain of our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 
service and other revenues  which primarily includes maintenance contracts  replacement parts  non warranty repair services  installation and training services  and fee per scan revenue are recognized ratably over the contract period for maintenance contracts  at the time of shipment for replacement parts  as the service is rendered for repair  installation and training services and as the fees are collected for fee per scan revenue 
product warranties 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the warranty accrual in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of digital mammography systems sold 
income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the valuation allowance as of september  primarily relates to certain state net operating losses for which we can only realize a benefit through the generation of future taxable income in the specific state and where realization is currently uncertain 
in fiscal  we reduced our valuation allowance by million as we determined that based on our operating history and projections of future taxable income  it is more likely than not our remaining net deferred tax asset of million is fully realizable 
the benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to tax expense and increases to additional paid in capital 
the valuation allowance as of september  primarily related to federal and state net operating losses and research and development tax credits generated in fiscal   and for which we could only realize a benefit through the generation of future taxable income and to certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions  for which realization was uncertain as of september  we establish tax reserves based on our assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits 
these tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received notification that the joint committee on taxation had no exceptions with the internal revenue service s conclusions on several tax returns under examination 
therefore  we released  of tax reserves related to these returns further reducing our effective tax rate for fiscal the american jobs creation act of the act introduced a special one time dividend received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
the president signed the act into law on october  even in light of the act  we did not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us our current intention is to reinvest the total amount of our approximately million of unremitted earnings permanently or repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture and distribution of proprietary x ray  digital x ray and other medical imaging systems 
our businesses are reported as four segments mammography  osteoporosis assessment  digital detectors  and other 
our mammography products include a broad product line of breast imaging products  including film based and digital mammography systems and breast biopsy systems 
our osteoporosis assessment products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems and  to a lesser extent  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product 
bone densitometry is the precise measurement of bone density to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases that can lead to debilitating bone fractures 
our digital detector products are a digital component for original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their own equipment 
our other business segment includes our mini c arm  conventional general radiography service and digital general radiography systems businesses 
our mini c arm products are low intensity  real time mini c arm x ray systems used primarily for minimally invasive surgery on a patient s extremities 
in january  we closed the manufacturing facility for the conventional general radiography products  however  we continue to service and support most of these product lines 
during fiscal  we phased out our digital general radiography systems and have continued to focus on supplying our digital detectors  reported under our digital detector segment  to other original equipment manufacturers 
recent developments on september   we completed the acquisition of fischer imaging corporation s intellectual property relating to its mammography business and products  including the rights to their senoscan digital mammography and mammotest stereotactic breast biopsy systems 
the purchase price for the intellectual property was million  approximately million of which was paid out of existing cash with the remaining amount paid through the cancellation of the principal and interest outstanding under a million secured loan we previously provided to fischer imaging on june  as previously reported we expect to incur an up front charge of approximately million to write off in process research and development in the first quarter of fiscal  which ends on december  in addition  we expect to incur an annual charge of approximately million beginning in fiscal to amortize certain intangible assets acquired in the transaction 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by items as shown in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal years ended september  september  september  revenues product sales service and other revenue cost and expenses cost of product sales cost of service and other revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative income from operations interest income interest other expense income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales mammography osteoporosis assessment digital detectors other in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenues from our mammography products  and to a lesser extent  an increase in digital detector and osteoporosis assessment sales 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in our other segment product sales  primarily attributable to our continued phase out of our general radiography systems business 
we have discontinued taking orders for these systems but continue to service the installed base 
mammography product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in digital mammography system sales  a million increase in multicare stereotactic table sales and a million increase in analog mammography systems sales 
the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems sold in the united states and by the inclusion of the cad computer aided detection software option on almost all of the units sold in the united states during the current year offset in part  by a slight decrease in the number of selenia systems sold in europe and a slight decrease in the average selling price for selenia systems in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we sold digital mammography systems compared to systems in fiscal we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
the increase in sales of our analog mammography systems was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold internationally and for our multicare stereotactic tables was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold worldwide in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal osteoporosis assessment product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems and upgrades sold in the united states and an increase in the number of our lower priced explorer bone densitometry systems sold internationally  that was offset in part by a slight decrease in the average selling prices 
digital detector product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in europe  a million increase in the united states  and an  increase in asia compared to fiscal the increase in the united states and asia primarily reflects the increase in the number of digital detectors sold for general radiography systems  while the increase for europe primarily reflects the higher number of digital detectors sold for the mammography systems of our oem partner 
we continue to supply our digital detectors to other original equipment manufacturers 
in fiscal we plan to focus more heavily on our digital detectors for mammography and expect that sales of our digital detectors for general radiography may begin to decline reflecting our primary focus on mammography markets 
in the current fiscal year  sales of digital detectors for general radiography accounted for million of digital detector product sales and sales of digital detectors for mammography accounted for million of digital detector product sales 
other product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in worldwide digital general radiography product sales and a million decrease in our worldwide mini c arm product sales 
the decrease in general radiography product sales reflect our decision to phase out our digital general radiography systems 
as a result of this decision  we expect our product sales for our digital general radiography systems to be negligible going forward 
in the current fiscal year  sales of digital general radiography systems accounted for million of other product revenues 
the decrease in sales of our mini c arm products for the current fiscal year was primarily due to a reduction in the number of systems sold in the united states and in europe as a result of increased competition as well as the deferral of purchases in anticipation of our pending release of insight  our new mini c arm system 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
we believe the shift in sales dollars to the united states market is primarily due to an increase in demand for our selenia digital mammography system as digital mammography is becoming more widely accepted in the united states 
the decrease in sales in other international markets in fiscal was primarily attributable to the fulfillment of a large order for our selenia digital mammography systems in mexico in fiscal service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenue service and other revenue is primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to increases in the number of service contracts sold  training revenues and spare parts in our mammography segment and  to a lesser extent  in our osteoporosis assessment and digital detector segments 
we believe that these increases reflect the continued growth in our installed base of systems and digital detectors 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to increased revenues and improved profitability associated with the shift in mammography product sales to selenia  our full field digital mammography systems  and the increase in revenues for digital detectors resulting in an improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the selenia systems have significantly higher selling prices  more than offsetting the higher costs of the product  when compared to analog mammography 
this improvement was partially offset by a slight reduction in the average selling prices for digital mammography systems worldwide  a significant increase in the number of analog mammography systems sold internationally  which earn a lower gross margin than digital mammography  and a shift in sales to lower margin bone densitometry systems  sold both internationally and into the primary care market in the united states 
cost of service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  change amount of service revenue amount of service revenue amount cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue increased as a percentage of service and other revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs increased as a percentage of service and other revenue primarily due to increased warranty costs of million and million in our digital detector and mammography businesses  respectively  and due to additional personnel and other costs to expand our service capabilities  especially in the united states  to support our growing installed base of products 
we expect our costs of service and other revenue to remain relatively high as a percentage of service and other revenue  reflecting our need to employ the required personnel for warranty  non warranty and installation activities to service our growing installed base of products 
we also expect an increase in customers entering into service agreements in connection with our transition to digital mammography and direct service coverage 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in mammography related expenses of million and in digital detectors of  primarily related to our tomosynthesis development project and  to a lesser extent  an increase in mini c arm related expenses of  these increases were primarily due to increased headcount and compensation related expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in research and development spending and personnel costs of  primarily related to our phase out of the digital general radiography systems product line 
we expect total research and development expenses to continue to increase as we accelerate our development efforts in tomosynthesis technology for mammography in fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million of salaries  benefits and travel expenses from an increase in our direct sales force  million of increased commissions to our direct sales force due to the increased product sales in direct territories and  of additional freight charges due to increased sales to customers in group purchasing organizations 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease of international distributor commissions primarily related to the sale of selenias in mexico in fiscal sales and marketing expenses have also shifted between the operating segments for the current fiscal year by increasing in mammography reflecting our increased revenues from that segment  and decreasing for each of our osteoporosis assessment  digital detectors and other business segments 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and related benefits  an increase of million in legal expenses primarily related to the settlement of two disputes and an increase of  in accounting and tax expenses associated with additional corporate governance required by the sarbanes oxley act of interest income 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest income interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a higher investment balance and an increase in the interest rate earned in the current year compared to last year 
interest and other income expense years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest and other income expense in fiscal  these expenses were primarily comprised of the interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable of  partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains of  in fiscal  these expenses were primarily comprised of interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable 
in september  we paid off the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 
provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount provision for income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we had recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized 
in fiscal  we considered our recent operating results  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result  we have determined that we are able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  and therefore  an adjustment of million was made to reduce the valuation allowance 
the benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to tax expense and increases to additional paid in capital in the current fiscal year 
however  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we received notification that the joint committee on taxation had no exceptions with the internal revenue service s conclusions on several tax returns under examination 
therefore  we released  of tax reserves related to these returns further reducing our provision for income taxes in fiscal we provided for nominal federal  state and foreign income taxes in fiscal and certain minimum taxes where net operating losses could not be used 
segment results of operations our businesses are reported as four segments mammography  osteoporosis assessment  digital detectors and other 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
mammography 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income mammography revenues increased primarily due to the million increase in product sales discussed above and an increase of million in service and other revenues primarily related to the increased number of installed systems reaching warranty expiration 
operating income for this business segment increased primarily due to the increased revenues 
our gross margin in this business segment remained constant at in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal our gross margins improved from the increase in product revenues of our more profitable selenia systems versus our analog mammography systems 
this improvement in the gross margin was offset by a reduction in the average selling prices for the base digital mammography systems without the cad option and a significant increase in the sales of lower end analog mammography systems sold internationally at lower margin rates than in the united states and compared to the digital mammography product line  and an increase in service related costs 
in general  we expect improved gross margins in fiscal from the shift in product revenues to our more profitable selenia full field digital mammography systems from our analog mammography systems 
partially offsetting the gross margin increase in absolute dollars was increased operating expenses associated with growing the business  including increased headcount and our tomosynthesis technology development efforts 
osteoporosis assessment 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income osteoporosis assessment revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the million increase in product sales discussed above and a million increase in service revenues 
the increase in service revenues was primarily due to the increased number of systems in our installed base 
operating income for osteoporosis assessment increased primarily due to increased revenues and  to a much lesser extent  a reduction in operating expenses 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in osteoporosis assessment gross margins was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and related improved absorption of manufacturing costs 
the reduction in operating expenses of  was primarily attributable to reduced commissions expense  primarily related to the shift to international sales 
digital detectors 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss digital detector revenues increased primarily due to the increased number of digital detectors sold as discussed above and a  increase in service revenues 
the service revenues increase is due to the increase in the number of detectors in the installed base 
the increase in the digital detector business operating loss is primarily due to increases in our warranty expenses  and  to a lesser extent  increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses partially offset by the improved gross profit from the increased revenues 
our gross margin in this business segment decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased warranty expenses 
the increase in research and development spending was primarily related to our tomosynthesis development project 
other 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income revenues for this business segment  which includes the mini c arm business  the digital general radiography business and the conventional general radiography service business  decreased primarily due to a million decrease in digital general radiography systems sold worldwide  as a result of our phase out of that business  and a million decrease in product sales of our mini c arm products as discussed above 
the improvements in operating income were primarily due to lower operating expenses as a result of our decision to de emphasize the digital general radiography systems business  which has been substantially phased out  and to reallocate resources and costs in order to focus on the more profitable and faster growing digital mammography systems 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales mammography osteoporosis assessment digital detectors other in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the continued growth in the number of our selenia full field digital mammography systems sold and to a lesser extent  our increase in digital detector sales 
partially offsetting these increases was the decrease in sales attributable to our continued phasing out of our general radiography systems business  which is included in our other segment 
we continue to service the installed base of such equipment 
mammography product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in worldwide digital mammography system sales and a million increase in multicare stereotactic tables sold in the united states 
the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems sold and  to a lesser extent  a modest increase in the average selling price for those systems 
in fiscal we sold digital mammography systems compared to systems in fiscal the increase in the average selling price of the selenia contributed million to our digital mammography product sales during fiscal we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
the increase in sales of our multicare stereotactic tables  in the united states  was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tables sold in the first two quarters of fiscal as compared to the corresponding quarters of the prior year 
the increases in digital mammography and table sales were partially offset by a million decrease in analog mammography systems sales in the united states  primarily as a result of reduced unit sales of those systems related to the increased market acceptance of digital mammography 
osteoporosis assessment product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales of our dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems in the united states and a decrease of  due to a reduction in the number of sahara ultrasound systems sold in the united states 
the decrease in united states sales of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold and a shift to our lower priced systems sold into the primary care market 
these reductions were partially offset by a million increase in sales in international markets  primarily attributable to an increase in the number of our lower priced explorer systems sold  and a  increase in upgrade sales 
digital detector product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of digital detectors sold in the united states and europe  partially offset by a decrease in the number of detectors sold in asia 
product sales of digital detectors in fiscal increased million in the united states  million in europe and decreased million in asia compared to fiscal the increase in the united states primarily reflects the increase in the number of digital detectors sold for general radiography systems  while the increase for europe primarily reflects the increase in the number of digital detectors sold for mammography systems 
the decrease in asia is primarily due to a reduction in the number of digital general radiography detectors sold 
other product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in worldwide digital general radiography product sales and a million decrease in our mini c arm product sales  primarily in the united states 
the decrease in general radiography product sales reflects our decision to phase out our digital general radiography systems 
in the current year  sales of digital general radiography systems accounted for million of other product revenues 
we attribute the decrease in sales of our mini c arm products primarily to a reduction in the number of systems sold as a result of increased competition and competitive pricing pressure 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  in latin america and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  in latin america and in other international markets 
we believe the shift in sales to europe and other international markets was primarily due to the timing of an increase in demand from those territories 
the increase in sales in latin america during fiscal was primarily attributable to a large sale of our selenia digital mammography systems in mexico in the first six months of fiscal in the second half of fiscal our product sales to latin america constituted approximately of our total product sales 
service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenue service and other revenue is primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in service and other revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in service contract revenues in our mammography segment compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of our assuming service responsibilities previously performed by a former distributor and the continued growth in our installed base of mammography systems and digital detectors 
the increase in mammography service revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in osteoporosis assessment service revenues 
we attribute this decrease primarily to the completion of a multi year service contract in europe during fiscal that has not been renewed 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to increased revenues and improved gross margins recognized on the shift in mammography product sales to selenia 
these systems have significantly higher selling prices  more than offsetting the higher costs of the product  when compared to analog mammography 
this improvement was partially offset by reduced margins associated with the decrease in our product sales  a shift to international sales where we generally sell at lower prices through distributors and a shift to lower priced systems sold into the united states primary care market in our osteoporosis assessment segment and the decrease in mini c arm systems sales 
cost of service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  change amount of service revenue amount of service revenue amount cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue increased both in percentage of service revenue and absolute dollars  primarily related to additional personnel and other costs to expand our service capabilities  especially in the united states  as we continue to assume direct coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors and to support our growing installed base of products and due to increased warranty costs in our digital detector business 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in research and development spending and personnel costs of million primarily related to our phase out of the digital general radiography systems product line announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal these decreases were offset in part from an increase in mammography related research and development expenses of million  including our tomosynthesis development project 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase of approximately  of international distributor commissions primarily related to the sale of selenias in mexico in the first six months of fiscal   of increased commissions to our direct sales force due to the increased product sales in direct territories and  of tradeshow expenses related to the promotion of our new  selenia system 
sales and marketing expenses have also shifted between the operating segments for fiscal as compared to fiscal by increasing in mammography  reflecting our increased revenues from that segment  and decreasing for our digital general radiography systems which are being phased out 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue these expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of these expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in bonus and profit sharing expense in accordance with the applicable plans as a result of continued improved financial results 
in addition  we incurred  of due diligence expenses in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with a potential acquisition 
prior to the end of the third quarter we decided not to pursue this potential acquisition further and accordingly expensed all acquisition costs in that quarter 
partially offsetting these increases were a  decrease in the bad debt provision as a result of strong cash collections in fiscal  a  decrease of legal fees and a  decrease in the fees associated with our note payable to wells fargo foothill  inc due to an amendment executed in july interest income 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest income interest income decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate earned in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by higher investment balances 
interest and other income expense 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest and other income expense interest and other income expense primarily consist of interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable 
the decrease in these expenses was primarily due to the amendment made to the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable in the third quarter of fiscal that significantly reduced the costs related to this facility 
other expense also includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest costs on a bank line of credit used by our european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure in these transactions 
in fiscal and we did not recognize any significant foreign exchange gains or losses or incur any interest charges under our foreign currency line of credit 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 
provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount provision for income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we have provided for nominal federal  state and foreign income taxes in fiscal and and certain minimum taxes where net operating losses cannot be used 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb  accounting changes  in fiscal in connection with the adoption of eitf  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of  in the first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources at september  we had approximately million of working capital 
at that date our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million during fiscal primarily due to cash provided by operating and financing activities partially offset by the use of cash in investing activities 
our cash provided by operating activities was million  which included net income of million for fiscal increased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of an aggregate of million 
cash provided by operations due to changes in our current assets and liabilities included an increase in accrued expenses of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and an increase in accounts payable of million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million 
the increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of deferred service contracts and an increase in customer deposits 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increased revenues during fiscal the increase in inventory was to support the increased sales volume  especially for digital mammography 
in fiscal  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment of million  which consisted primarily of manufacturing and test equipment  computer hardware and demonstration equipment 
in addition  we extended a million secured loan in connection with the definitive agreement to acquire the intellectual property related to the mammography business of fischer imaging corporation 
on september   we completed the acquisition of the intellectual property relating to fischer imaging s mammography business and the loan was credited toward the purchase price at closing 
the note bore interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate at september  plus 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we used million of cash to complete the acquisition of this intellectual property 
in fiscal  financing activities provided us with million of cash 
these cash flows included approximately million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by  of repayments  of our term loan with wells fargo foothill  inc we maintain an unsecured line of credit with a european bank for the equivalent of million  which bears interest at the europe interbank offered rate at september  plus 
the borrowings under this line are primarily used by our european subsidiaries to settle intercompany sales and are denominated in the respective local currencies of its european subsidiaries 
the line of credit may be canceled by the bank with days notice 
at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under this line 
in september we obtained a secured loan from wells fargo foothill  inc on september   we repaid the loan in full 
the loan agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc  provided for a term loan of approximately million  which we borrowed at signing  and a revolving line of credit facility 
following repayment  the loan agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms 
in september  we completed a sale leaseback transaction for our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the lease for these facilities  including the associated land  has a term of years  with four five year year renewal terms  which we may exercise at our option 
the basic rent for the facilities is million per year  which is subject to adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
the aggregate total minimum lease payments during the initial year term are million 
in addition  we are required to maintain the facilities during the term of the lease and to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other costs associated with those facilities 
under the lease  we make customary representations and warranties and agree to certain financial covenants and indemnities 
in the event we default on the lease  the landlord may terminate the lease  accelerate payments and collect liquidated damages 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  in october  we received a request from the federal trade commission  the ftc  that asks us to voluntarily produce certain information and material to the ftc 
the ftc s request  which does not allege any wrongdoing  is part of an ftc non public investigation to determine whether our recent acquisition of certain assets owned by fischer imaging corporation may be anticompetitive and in violation of section of the clayton act or section of the federal trade commission act 
we are in the process of responding to the ftc request 
because the investigation is at an early stage  we cannot predict its outcome or its effect  if any  on our business 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations the purchase obligations primarily relate to an exclusive distribution and service agreement in the united states under which we will sell and service a line of extremity mri systems 
pursuant to the terms of this contract  we have certain minimum inventory purchase obligations for the initial term and are subject to renegotiation after the first eighteen month period in the event of any unforeseen changes in the market dynamics 
except as set forth above  we do not have any other significant capital commitments 
we are working on several projects  with an emphasis on digital mammography 
in addition  we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  and strategic alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business 
subject to the risk factors set forth below and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this report  we believe that we have sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months 
the expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
statement must be adopted for fiscal years starting after june  we expect to adopt statement starting in our fiscal first quarter of  which begins on september  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
on december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach on statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted for fiscal years starting after june  we expect to adopt statement r starting in our fiscal first quarter of  which begins on september  as permitted by statement r we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we estimate that the stock based compensation cost will be approximately million in fiscal as a result of the adoption of statement r 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no  accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
the markets for our direct radiography products are in the early stage of development 
in  our subsidiary  direct radiography corp  was the first company to introduce direct to digital x ray imaging products in the united states 
the markets for these products are relatively new 
there is a significant installed base of conventional x ray imaging products in hospitals and radiological practices 
the use of our direct to digital x ray imaging products  including digital mammography products  in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x ray imaging equipment 
moreover  we believe that a major factor in the market s acceptance of direct to digital x ray technology is the trend toward transition by the healthcare industry from conventional film archiving systems to hospital picture archiving and communications systems  known as pacs  to store x ray images electronically 
because the benefits of our direct to digital technology may not be fully realized by customers until they install a pacs platform  a large potential market for these products may not develop until pacs environments are more widely used 
because of the early stage of the markets for these products  it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time 
we cannot assure that the markets for our direct radiography products will continue to develop 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our direct radiography products require  we will not be successful in developing and marketing those products 
the manufacture of our direct radiography detectors is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing these detectors in commercial quantities  primarily related to delays and difficulties in obtaining critical components for these detectors that meet our high manufacturing standards 
our initial difficulties have led to increased delivery lead times and increased costs of manufacturing these products 
our failure  including the failure of our contract manufacturers  to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns  product recalls or withdrawals  or other problems that could harm our business and prospects 
we continue to incur significant losses in our digital detector business segment and cannot assure that the segment will become profitable 
our digital detector business segment incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal at the beginning of fiscal we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography 
notwithstanding this shift in focus  we have continued to experience significant losses in our digital detector business segment and cannot assure that the operating results of this segment will improve 
our success depends on new product development 
we have a continuing research and development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products 
we are expending significant resources on the development of digital x ray imaging products  including the development of a digital mammography product to perform breast tomosynthesis  a dimensional imaging technique 
the successful development of our products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products  including  for example  changes requested by the fda in connection with pre market approval applications for our products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects 
our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications 
we are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products 
newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects 
in addition  these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications 
if  despite our internal testing and testing by our customers  any of our products contains errors or defects or any of our products fails to meet customer specifications  then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies 
we may not be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  and may only be able to do so at considerable expense 
in addition  any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction  negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects 
our reliance on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products could harm our business and prospects 
we rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products 
in particular we have a limited number of suppliers for each of the panel and the coating of that panel for our direct radiography products 
in addition  we have only limited sources of supply for some key components used in our mini c arm systems 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects 
any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments  which could result in lost or deferred sales 
if we are unable to satisfy our financial covenants under our long term leases for our headquarters and lorad facilities  the rent due under those leases may be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our long term leases contain financial and other covenants 
if we do not comply with our covenants under our long term leases  the remaining rent payable under those leases could be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our failure to meet any of our covenants under our long term leases could significantly harm our liquidity and financial position 
we may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete or will compete with our products 
many of these competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to hospitals  radiology clients  general purchasing organizations and other potential customers 
in addition  many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and offer a range of products broader than our products 
some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects 
our mammography systems compete with products offered by ge  siemens  planmed  giotto  toshiba and agfa 
our minimally invasive breast biopsy systems compete with products offered by ge  siemens  philips  planmed  giotto and with conventional surgical biopsy procedures 
our mini c arm products compete directly with mini c arms manufactured and sold by a limited number of companies including ge 
we also compete indirectly with manufacturers of conventional c arm image intensifiers including philips  siemens and ge 
the primary competitor for our osteoporosis assessment products is general electric medical systems ge 
our direct to digital imaging products compete with traditional x ray systems as well as indirect conversion systems  such as computed radiography systems  which are less expensive than our products  and other direct to digital systems 
the larger competitors in these markets include ge  siemens  kodak  canon  philips  swissray  fuji and varian 
at the beginning of fiscal  we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography and focus more on expanding our oem sales for our directray panel 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for our products has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements 
we believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance our existing products  successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance 
if we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology 
our business may be harmed by acquisitions we have completed and may complete in the future 
we have acquired related businesses  technologies  product lines  and products and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business  diversion of our management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately  of professional fees  which we expensed  in connection with the analysis and negotiation of a potential acquisition that we decided not to complete 
if we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions  we will be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete 
should we acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business 
we may incur significant additional and unforeseen expenses and costs to defend or pursue litigation  investigations or other inquiries in connection with acquisitions that we complete 
we cannot guarantee that we will not become subject to litigation  investigations or inquiries in connection with acquisitions that we complete  which may cause us to incur significant additional and unforeseen costs to defend or pursue litigation or investigations or other inquiries relating to the acquisition 
in october  we received a request from the ftc that asks us to voluntarily produce certain information and material to the ftc 
the ftc s request  which does not allege any wrongdoing  is part of an ftc non public investigation to determine whether our recent acquisition of certain assets owned by fischer imaging corporation may be anticompetitive and in violation of section of the clayton act or section of the federal trade commission act 
we are in the process of responding to the ftc request 
because the investigation is at an early stage  we cannot predict its outcome or its effect  if any  on our business 
our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects 
we have entered into strategic alliances with agfa  siemens  r technologies and icad 
we are also exploring other potential alliances  joint ventures or other business relationships 
agfa and siemens compete with us in some of our business segments  and are competitors or potential competitors to some of our customers or potential customers 
our alliance with agfa  siemens or any other person could enhance their business to our detriment or make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others 
moreover  we may not be able to identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures  assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated  successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us  or successfully manage any alliance or joint venture 
furthermore  any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
our entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture or failure to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively could harm our business and prospects 
the uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based healthcare practitioners 
healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the united states and in many foreign countries could limit the use of our products  reduce reimbursement available for such use  or adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted 
these reforms or cost containment measures  including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect  could harm our business and prospects and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on advantageous terms  if at all 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers 
the costs of our products are substantial  and market acceptance of our products depends upon our customers ability to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for use of our products 
in the united states  the centers for medicare medicaid services  known as cms  establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating medicare and medicaid patients 
under current cms guidelines  varying reimbursement levels have been established for bone density assessment  mammography and other imaging and diagnostic procedures performed by our products 
the actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state medicare carriers and  for non medicare and medicaid patients  private insurance carriers 
there are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by cms and by a state medicare carrier and private insurance carriers 
moreover  states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the cms reimbursement guidelines 
the use of our products outside the united states is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory and insurance carriers 
a reduction or other adverse change in reimbursement policies for the use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
the future growth of our bone densitometry business depends in large part on the continued development and more widespread acceptance of complementary therapies as well as our ability to expand into the primary care market 
our bone densitometers and related products are used to assist physicians in diagnosing patients at risk for osteoporosis and other bone disorders  and to monitor the effectiveness of therapies to treat these disorders 
as a result  the future growth of the market for these products and of this business will in large part be dependent upon the development and more widespread acceptance of drug therapies to prevent and to treat osteoporosis  and in addition  our ability to expand into the primary care market 
over the last several years  the fda has approved a number of drug therapies to treat osteoporosis 
we also understand that a number of other drug therapies are under development 
while sales of our bone densitometry products have benefited from the increased availability and use of these therapies  most patients who are at risk for osteoporosis continue to go untreated 
we cannot assure that any therapies under development or in clinical trials will prove to be effective  obtain regulatory approval  or that any approved therapy will gain wide spread acceptance  or that we will be able to expand into the primary care market 
even if these therapies gain widespread acceptance  we cannot assure that this acceptance will increase the sales of our products 
reductions in revenues could harm our operating results because a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
we likely will not be able to reduce spending to compensate for adverse fluctuations in revenues 
as a result  shortfalls in revenues are likely to harm our operating results 
our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation 
the results for a particular quarter may vary due to a number of factors  including the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts  the development status and demand for drug therapies to treat osteoporosis  the development status and demand for our direct to digital imaging products  economic conditions in our markets  foreign exchange rates  the timing of orders  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  the mix of products sold by us  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  and pricing and other competitive conditions 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments 
production difficulties could also delay shipments 
any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices  particularly those that employ x ray technology 
our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of european currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business  in relation to the us dollar  have harmed and could continue to harm our business and prospects 
foreign sales accounted for approximately of our product sales in fiscal  of our product sales in fiscal and of product sales in fiscal we maintain a sales and service office in belgium and a support office in france 
the expenses and sales of these offices are denominated in local currencies 
we anticipate that foreign sales and sales denominated in foreign currencies will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
fluctuations in the value of local currencies have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  amounts translated into us dollars to fluctuate in comparison with previous periods 
we have hedged our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local european currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices 
there is a risk that these hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure 
we conduct our business worldwide  which exposes us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
we sell our products to customers throughout the world 
our worldwide business may be harmed by difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations  greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection  possible adverse tax consequences  governmental currency controls  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  export import controls  and tariff regulations 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
in addition  we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications 
there is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our technology 
moreover  there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states intellectual property laws 
in the absence of significant patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products  processes or technology 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries 
we are and have been engaged  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
for example  in march  we were served with a complaint alleging that our htc grid infringes us patent number  the plaintiff is seeking to preliminarily and permanently enjoin us from infringing the patent  as well as damages resulting from the alleged infringement  treble damages and reasonable attorneys fees  and such other and further relief as may be available 
we do not believe that we infringe any valid or enforceable patents of the plaintiff and we intend to vigorously defend our interests 
in connection with litigation or claims are asserted against our intellectual property rights  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may harm our business and prospects 
our future success will depend on the continued services of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel  particularly our key research and development personnel  could harm our business and prospects 
our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly software engineers and other technical personnel  is intense 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel 
recently issued regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
we have historically used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our compensation packages 
we believe that equity awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with us 
the recent changes in the accounting for employee stock options and other share based payments under statement r requires us to record a charge to earnings for new and unvested employee stock option grants beginning on september  in addition  rules of the nasdaq national market that require shareholder approval for stock option plans  and regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange that prohibit nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
if these new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant stock options or other equity awards to employees  we may need to change our equity compensation strategy and we may find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are exposed to potential risks and we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september  and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if  when aggregated  they constitute more than an inconsequential deficiency 
as a result of this evaluation  no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses were identified 
although we have completed the documentation and testing of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we expect to continue to incur costs  including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels  in order to maintain compliance with that section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we continue to monitor controls for any additional weaknesses or deficiencies 
no evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported

our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  foreign exchange rate volatility and other risks identified under the heading risk factors in part ii  item a above
