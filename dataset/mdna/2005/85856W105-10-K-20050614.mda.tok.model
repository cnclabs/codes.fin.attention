overview in  we launched one of the first software product suites on the market that was fully developed and created expressly for web based content and document management 
at the time  content management today considered a critical component of an organization s communication and information technology it infrastructure was an emerging technology used to help companies easily and quickly share information with employees  partners  customers and prospects using the world wide web 
currently  our solutions which are comprised of universal content management tm software and content components software help customers worldwide solve business problems related to efficiently creating  managing  sharing and archiving critical information 
markets and customers as of march   we had approximately  corporate customers for our universal content management products  approximately oem customers and approximately corporate customers for our desktop viewing and conversion technology 
no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of our total revenues in fiscal year customers use our products as follows universal content management organizations deploy stellent universal content management software to build enterprise wide content management deployments and line of business solutions  such as public web sites  intranets for internal only company information  extranets  which are web sites available only to select audiences  such as partners and customers  multi site management  which is the development and management of all of the above types of web sites  and financial compliance initiatives  such as sarbanes oxley 
content components other technology companies embed this technology into their own products to enable their users to view business information on  and to convert business information to formats 
table of contents viewable on handheld devices or in a web browser 
these technologies are also integrated into our universal content management software 
products our product set is comprised of two main categories universal content management software and content components software 
universal content management software universal content management is stellent s primary software product  consisting of a unified architecture and product which power multiple applications 
these applications help organizations manage their business information such as records  legal documents such as contracts  business documents  presentations  web content and graphics from the time it s created to the time it s archived or disposed of  so that employees  customers  partners and investors can more easily find  access and re use that information 
with stellent software  customers can increase employee productivity  reduce expenses and improve company wide collaboration and communication 
our universal content management software addresses the key elements of content management document management and imaging  web content management  digital asset management  collaboration and records management from a unified architecture  enabling customers to fully utilize their content management investment across the organization 
we believe our tightly integrated products allow companies to implement content management applications using fewer products and consulting services than other content management offerings  which can lead to a lower total cost of ownership 
the stellent system is also easy to use 
users can submit  or contribute  business content such as a word processing document  spreadsheet or cad file to the stellent system  and the stellent technology automatically converts the file to a format that can be viewed on a web site 
this automatic conversion capability enables even non technical users to easily publish information to a site  such as an employee portal or partner extranet  so the information can be shared with other users 
our universal content management software is comprised primarily of stellent content server and five key application modules  and is targeted toward four primary usage scenarios  all of which are described below 
stellent content server stellent content server is a fully functional system providing secure  personalized delivery of business information 
this repository provides a core set of content services such as check in check out  revision control  security  workflow  personalization and subscription that help ensure users can access only the most current information as appropriate to their role or permissions 
content server also provides a variety of repository services  including file storage  metadata and search 
application modules on top of stellent content server  users can add the following five key content management application modules web content management enables organizations to create web content  and manage and publish web sites 
document management and imaging provides web based management  collaboration and access to business information created in common office software applications or created as paper documents which are then converted into electronic images 
digital asset management enables digital assets such as photos  graphics  audio clips and video clips to be searched  accessed  viewed  managed  distributed and re purposed via the web 

table of contents records management provides a web based method for managing business records and creating rules such as expiration  archiving and deletion regarding the disposition of that content 
collaboration management enables the creation of a project or team space for sharing documents  schedules and discussions among a team via the web 
primary usage scenarios enterprise content management enterprise content management ecm is an infrastructure for all content based applications within an enterprise  allowing organizations to strategically select  deploy and maintain an effective  efficient knowledge platform within their organizations 
often times  the ability to provide an ecm infrastructure is a requirement in line of business transactions as companies look ahead to other upcoming content management needs 
compliance management the need to comply with government mandates for financial records retention and compliance monitoring such as sarbanes oxley has emerged as a driving factor in both business and technology decisions 
compliance solutions powered by content management technologies whether as a compliance platform for all regulations mandated for an organization  or as line of business compliance applications for individual regulatory efforts assist organizations in their compliance processes by automating the capture  retention  management and disposition of electronic files and physical documents maintained for compliance purposes 
multi site management multi site management refers to a content management infrastructure for creating and managing multiple  distributed web properties such as public web sites  intranets  extranets and portals 
stellent s second generation  multi site management solution offers a rapidly deployable product  allowing companies to easily launch and maintain multiple internal or external sites while preserving appropriate corporate branding 
customer applications in addition to the three usage scenarios outlined above  stellent customers use our content management technology to power a variety of other high value applications  including public facing web sites  corporate intranets  dealer and partner extranets  human resource portals  customer service web sites  marketing brand management  and accounts payable imaging 
content components software stellent s content components software makes information created in more than common office software applications more accessible to the business users who need it 
other technology companies embed this software to enable their own solutions to extract text and metadata  provide a high fidelity view of file contents  and convert files into any one of output formats 
since business information is often difficult to access without the native software application in which it was created  stellent s content components software empowers users to locate and view information without needing the software application that created the file installed on their desktop or handheld device 
these technologies are also integrated into stellent s universal content management software 
the content components software supports multiple operating systems and international environments  and enables access to documents in applications for diverse markets such as content management  search and retrieval  security and policy management  mobile and wireless  messaging  collaboration and publishing 
suppliers we have no sole source or limited source suppliers that we materially depend upon for our products described above 
contracts the types of license contracts we enter into with our customers are typically perpetual arrangements for our direct customers and term based arrangements for our oem customers 
virtually all of our customers 
table of contents initially purchase maintenance contracts  which entitle them to unspecified upgrades and product support 
the primary reward or benefits to us of a perpetual licensing arrangement is the annual renewal of post contract support 
the primary benefit of a term based license is the ability to predict future license revenue streams from that customer 
the primary risk associated with the perpetual licensing arrangement is the non renewal of post contract support 
the primary risk of a term based license arrangement is the potential non renewal of that arrangement 
many of our direct customers enter into services arrangements  which may include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
application development generally is not critical to the functionality of the delivered software 
consulting services our consulting services group is focused on delivering value based content management solutions to our customers 
our consulting services professionals employ a combination of business analysis  enterprise architecture  application analysis  installation  configuration  development and integration skills with experience based project methodology and management knowledge to facilitate the rollout of content management solutions at all levels of a customer s organization 
available on a worldwide basis  we act as a business partner to our customers by providing a broad spectrum of services including technical architecture analysis and needs assessment  such as software  security and metadata analysis solutions development and deployment strategies software installation and configuration custom application development third party product integration project management knowledge transfer these services can be offered in conjunction with our software products to new customers  or on a stand alone basis to our existing customers to assist them in driving additional content management solutions across their enterprises 
these services are offered for fees  the amount of which depends on the nature and scope of the project 
product support we offer several product support programs that allow customers to select the offering s that best satisfies their maintenance and support requirements 
from the initial installation and configuration by us to the point of application deployment  our product support resources offer customer service through quick response time  trouble shooting and the delivery of complete and comprehensive technical solutions 
customers may access product support resources on a worldwide basis for assistance during the customer s normal business hours 
additional support offerings are available which supplement the customer s product support requirements 
product support offerings are renewable on an annual basis and are typically priced as a percentage of the product license fees or percentage of product list price 
product training we provide a full range of educational courses on our universal content management software 
the comprehensive web based modules and instructor led classes enable business end users  administrators  site designers  and developers to use our software more productively 
standard classes are scheduled at our designated worldwide training facilities  and both standard and customized classes are frequently taught at customer sites 

table of contents sales and marketing we market and sell our products using a combination of direct and indirect distribution channels primarily in north america and europe 
our primary distribution channel is our direct sales force  which targets mid and large size organizations 
our sales personnel work with target accounts to address unsolved business needs which can be remedied by the application of a business process built around our stellent universal content management software 
the analysis process will typically include a business process and technical systems evaluation performed by our pre sales personnel  followed by demonstrations of our products capabilities and direct negotiations with our sales staff 
in addition  we have used internal and external telemarketing operations that are responsible for customer prospecting  lead generation and follow up 
these activities identify and develop leads for further sales efforts by our direct sales force 
as of march   we had a worldwide total of direct and indirect sales and sales support personnel and marketing personnel  which includes business development and alliances 
we also use indirect sales channels to increase the distribution and visibility of our products through strategic alliances with resellers  oems  key systems integrators and other channel partners in both domestic and international markets 
we currently have operations or collaborations in australia  brazil  germany  japan  korea  the netherlands  the united kingdom and the united states 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on how successfully we recruit  train and retain sufficient direct and indirect sales and support personnel  and how well we continue to establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners  oems  key systems integrators and other channel partners 
we use a variety of marketing programs to build market awareness of our brand name and of our products  as well as to attract potential customers to our products 
a broad mix of programs is used to accomplish these goals  including market research  product and strategy updates with industry analysts  public relations activities  direct mail and relationship marketing programs  seminars  trade shows  speaking engagements  web site marketing and joint marketing programs 
our marketing organization produces marketing materials in support of sales to prospective customers that include brochures  data sheets  white papers  presentations and demonstrations 
research and development we have made substantial investments in research and development through both internal development and technology acquisitions 
our research and development expenditures for fiscal  and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses represented   and  respectively  of total revenue in those years 
we expect that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development in the future 
as of march   we had employees engaged in research and development activities 
in order to continue to provide product leadership in the content management and content components market  we intend to make major product releases approximately once per year 
the success of new introductions is dependent on several factors  including timely completion and market introduction  differentiation of new products and enhancements from those of our competitors and market acceptance of new products and enhancements 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  evolving industry standards and rapidly changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate changes  enhance our current products  develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advancements and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and enhancements that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 

table of contents acquisitions in may  we acquired all outstanding shares of optika inc for million in cash  approximately million shares of stellent common stock and the assumption by stellent of optika s outstanding common stock options 
we acquired optika in order to add to or strengthen and expand our universal content management software in the areas of document imaging  business process management and compliance capabilities 
competition the market for content management and content component software is intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we believe that our competitive advantages include superior technology and lower overall cost of ownership than our competitors 
however  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our primary source of competition  across the range of our product and service offerings  is from content management products offered by companies such as emc corporation  filenet corporation  ibm corporation  interwoven  inc  microsoft corporation  and vignette corporation 
we also compete with current or potential customers who may develop solutions internally 
in the content components area our primary competition is verity 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to apply such resources to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements to a greater extent than we can 
in particular  we believe that emc corporation  filenet corporation  ibm corporation and microsoft corporation all have larger market positions than we do 
also  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and access to larger customer bases than we have 
such competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer more attractive terms to purchasers than we can 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
competition in our market could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain revenues from software license fees from new or existing customers on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures may require us to reduce the price of our software 
in either case  we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
proprietary rights and licensing we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
united states and international copyright laws provide limited protections for our software  documentation and other written materials 
we license our products in object code format for limited use by customers 
we treat the source code for our products as a trade secret and we require all employees and third parties who need access to the source code to sign non disclosure agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
however  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
our failure to 
table of contents meaningfully protect our property could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe third parties may make claims of infringements with respect to our current or future product  but we cannot be sure that any such claims will arise 
we expect that developers of content management and content component products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our market grows and as the functionality of products in different segments of the software industry increasingly overlaps 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or develop or license technology with comparable functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
employees as of march   we had employees 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  retain  integrate and motivate highly qualified sales  technical and management personnel  for whom competition is intense 
from time to time we also employ independent contractors to support our services  product development  sales and marketing departments 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our relations with our employees are good

table of contents item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to various claims and litigation  including employment matters and intellectual property claims 
management does not believe the outcome of any current legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents as of march  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital total assets item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general in  we launched one of the first software product suites on the market specifically developed and created for managing business information using the web 
from the beginning  stellent focused on developing software that could be quickly implemented  easily used and easily scaled from line of business to enterprise wide applications 
this focus remains true today 
while early on we developed document management and web content management applications  in recent years we also expanded our product set to address market needs for an enterprise infrastructure for content centric applications  web based management of digital assets  which are digital materials such as photos and graphics  and web based management of business records 
the business information we manage for our customers is in an electronic form and is generally considered unstructured data  or data that is not easily managed by relational databases 
in fact  the vast majority of information in any business is considered to be unstructured information  and typically resides in areas such as personal computers  conventional file servers and paper documents 
in fiscal year  our universal content management software primarily addressed five areas of the enterprise content management market web content management  document management and imaging  digital asset management  records management and collaboration management 
currently  customers use our universal content management software to organize and maintain the electronic business information created by internal and external sources using a broad range of common software applications  such as microsoft office  autodesk autocad and sun staroffice 
this electronic business information includes items such as web pages  digital assets  scanned images  microsoft word documents  business records  contracts  spreadsheets and forms 
our software also assists in the conversion of paper documents to electronic format 
using stellent technology  customers can then publish that information to public web sites and or secure web sites available only to select audiences 
additionally  software vendors and manufacturers of electronic devices  such as cell phones and pdas  embed our content components software within their own technology to enable users to access and view electronic information from those applications or devices 
we market our products primarily to customers in the financial services  healthcare including insurance  government  and manufacturing industries located in the united states  canada  europe  latin america and asia 
in may  we acquired all outstanding shares of optika inc for million in cash  approximately million shares of stellent common stock and the assumption by stellent of optika s outstanding common stock options 
we acquired optika in order to add to or strengthen and expand our universal content management software in the areas of document imaging  business process management and compliance capabilities 
our approach has been to develop our products internally and acquire select third party technologies that enhance our products capabilities 
this approach has resulted in an integrated solution used by companies for line of business applications or enterprise wide deployment 

table of contents market trends we have experienced a difficult business environment in information technology spending over the past several years  but one that has been improving each year since fiscal year our license revenue increased modestly by from fiscal year to fiscal year our license revenue grew at an improved rate of from fiscal year to fiscal year  due in part to the acquisition of optika in may our growth in fiscal year from fiscal year was also driven by both an increase in our services revenue of and our post contact support by 
our post contract support renewal rate continues to be very high  a trend that we see continuing 
during fiscal year  we derived approximately of our revenue from the united states market and approximately from various international markets  primarily europe 
we have also been expanding into the asian markets  particularly japan and korea 
the percentage of revenue derived from asia remains small compared to the united states 
as our installed software base has increased  our revenue mix has shifted from product licenses to post contract support over the past three years 
our license revenue  as a percent of total revenue  has decreased from to to in fiscal years  and  respectively  while our post contact support revenue has increased from to to in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our consulting services and training revenue  as a percent of total revenue  was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect our installed software base to continue to grow  and with it our post contract support revenue 
with a larger portion of our revenues coming from both services and post contract support  our overall gross margins may decrease 
however  we anticipate our product license and total services revenue for fiscal year to be approximately of our total revenue 
on a longer term basis  we are anticipating our product license revenue to increase to approximately of our total revenue 
we believe stellent today can compete effectively in a rapidly evolving marketplace 
we believe the content management market is healthier than many other segments of the information technology sector and that it will perform better than the average information technology sector in customer spending during fiscal year we believe that the trend toward companies seeking solutions for managing multiple internal and external web sites will continue  content within the enterprise will continue to grow at a high rate  vendor consolidation  and the demand for integrated solutions  will continue to be a driving force in technology buying decisions  and compliance mandates and records management initiatives are increasingly driving technology purchasing decisions  and influencing which vendors are selected to power information related initiatives 
while we believe the general and long term market trends identified above will create continued demand for our products  the market for content management software and our products at any particular time is highly dependent on information technology spending 
although we experienced an overall increase in our revenue for fiscal year  the united states and international economic conditions continue to be a challenging environment to do business within  specifically for large capital expenditures 
in addition  we believe continuing difficult economic and market conditions are putting pressure on the ability of certain content management software companies to survive as independent entities  if at all 
restructurings in connection with the integration of optika and in connection with our plans to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  we adopted two restructuring plans during fiscal the initial restructuring took place during the first quarter and included the termination of employees and the closure of our new york facility 
the second restructuring plan was completed during our fourth quarter of fiscal year  which included the termination of employees and the closure of our boise  idaho and mexican facilities 
the expenses recognized during the first and fourth quarter of fiscal year related to these restructuring plans totaled million and million  respectively 
we expect the restructurings to reduce our annual operating 
table of contents expenses and increase our cash flow by approximately million 
additional information on our restructuring plans is contained in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during fiscal year  we continued to market and license our products and services primarily through a direct sales force and augmented our sales efforts through other relationships  such as with other software vendors  systems integrators  resellers and others 
our total revenues generated from operations outside of the united states decreased slightly in fiscal year to from approximately in fiscal year no customer accounted for more than of total revenues in fiscal year revenues years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages product licenses services post contract support total as a percentage of total revenue product licenses services post contract support total revenues increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was due to our acquisition of optika on may   two seven figure content component software license transactions and an overall increase in our universal content management license revenue 
additionally  we had an increase in revenues for services and post contract support due to a larger base of installed products and a continued increase use by our customers in using our consulting services personnel to implement our software 
as we license our products  whether on a perpetual basis for our universal content management software or on a term basis for our content components software  our installed base of products increases 
since the rate of annual renewals of post contract customer support services on our universal content management and content component software has remained high  our post contract customer support revenues have grown as our installed base of products has grown 
also  universal content management revenues related to consulting services work can increase as a result of a larger installed base of products 
we expect our installed base of products to continue to increase and our services revenue to grow 
total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was due to an increase in revenue for services due to a larger base of installed products and an increased reliance by our customer to use our consulting services personnel to implement our software 
sales outside the united states represented   and of our total revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively 
product licenses revenues for product licenses increased by million  or  to million for year from million for fiscal year the increase in product license revenues was attributable to sales generated from our acquisition of optika in may of  an increase in our content component software revenue and an overall increase in our universal content management software license revenue  both domestic and 
table of contents internationally 
the increase in our content component software revenue relates to two seven figure license transactions recognized during fiscal year as we experienced a favorable increase in demand for our universal content management and content components software licenses during fiscal year  the overall information technology environment for expenditures continued to remain soft 
although we anticipate this trend to continue through fiscal year  we expect our overall license revenue to increase in absolute dollars and should represent approximately of our total revenue 
revenues for product licenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in content components software revenues in the united states and europe and sales of universal content management software in japan 
the increase in our universal content management software revenues and content components software revenues was due to a moderate increase in demand mitigated by continued longer sales cycles for those products 
services revenues for services  consisting of consulting services  training and billable expenses  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues for services was due to the optika acquisition and an increase number of consulting engagements associated with the increased number of new license transactions sold during fiscal year we anticipate that the percentage of service revenue to total revenue will be approximately during fiscal year and service revenue in absolute dollars will increase 
revenues for services increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in consulting services revenue was due to our customers software implementations having become larger and more numerous 
generally  customers prefer to have us perform consulting services rather than using their internal information technology staff  a trend we believe will continue 
our consulting service revenue relates almost exclusively to our universal content management software as our content components software is embedded in other companies software and those companies would typically perform the consulting services 
universal content management revenues related to consulting services work can increase as a result of a larger installed base of products 
because we expect the trend toward companies increasingly using the web for communicating and publishing business information and the trend toward electronic devices being used increasingly to view electronic information to continue  we expect revenues attributable to consulting services to continue to increase 
a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting services engagements 
post contract support revenues for post contract support increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues for our post contract support was due to the optika acquisition and supporting a larger customer installed base of universal content management and content component products 
we anticipate that the percentage of post contract support revenue to total revenue will be approximately during fiscal year and post contract support revenue in absolute dollars will increase 
revenues for post contract support increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues for post contract support was due to a larger installed base of universal content management and content component products 
as we license our products  whether on a perpetual basis for our universal content management software or on a term basis for our content components software  our installed base of products increases 
since the rate of annual renewals of post contract customer support services on our universal content management and content component software has remained high  our post contract customer support revenues grow because we have a larger installed base of products 
since post contract customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a decline in post contract 
table of contents customer support revenues 
however  since post contract customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact would lag behind a decline in license revenues

the overall increase in cost of revenues dollars for product licenses was attributed to the acquisition of optika  changes in product mix  amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions discussed below and was partially offset by a reduction in certain fixed costs related to royalties for third party technology incorporated into our products  which had become fully amortized in the previous fiscal year

our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues may vary from period to period  depending in part on whether the services are performed by our in house staff  subcontractors or third party system integrators

the initial charge of million was recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year  which included costs for pay and benefits related to the involuntary termination of employees of approximately million with the remaining million related to the closure of our new york facility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year a change of estimate and impairment charge was recorded which resulted in million additional expense related to this restructuring plan

the decrease in net interest income for the fiscal year ended march  from was due to decreases in the interest rates earned by invested funds which declined over each period  and reduced amounts of invested funds 
investment gain impairment during fiscal year  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to our remaining investments in two non public  start up technology companies 
both of these companies are still in business  but upon review of their business plans and the incremental financing that they received  we determined the change in their valuation was other than temporary impairment 
during fiscal year  we sold our shares in a publicly traded company  an investment for which the value was previously written down to zero as the result of an other than temporary impairment 
we realized approximately million in proceeds and gain from the sale 
during fiscal year  our investment impairment was approximately million 
in the last quarter of fiscal year  after purchasing certain assets of active iq and reviewing its public disclosures  which stated it was selling their remaining operating assets of the company to another party  we determined that a permanent decline in value had occurred and recorded a write down of approximately million 
during the first three quarters of fiscal year  we determined that a permanent decline in the value of certain of our investments in other companies had occurred 
we made this determination after reviewing financial statements of these companies or discussing their future business plans and prospects with their management 
as a result  we recorded a write down on the investments in these companies of approximately million 
net operating loss carryforwards as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards on an annual basis will be limited as a result of ownership changes in connection with the sale of equity securities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax asset as of march  
table of contents because of uncertainty regarding its full realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  management considered such factors as our history of operating losses  potential future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations and satisfied our capital expenditure requirements through revolving working capital term loans from banking institutions  private placements and public offerings of securities 
to date  we have invested our capital expenditures in property and equipment  consisting largely of computer hardware and software 
capital expenditures for fiscal year and were million and million  respectively 
we have also entered into capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase as our employee base grows 
at march   we had capital expenditure lease commitments with remaining total payments of million 
as of march   we had million in cash and marketable securities and million in working capital 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  particularly through march  on a longer term basis  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or on any terms  or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions that could utilize equity and or cash resources 
such opportunities could develop quickly due to market and competitive factors

these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the extent to which these non cash items increase or decrease in amount and increase or decrease our future operating results will have no corresponding impact on our operating cash flows 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers offset by payments to our employees  vendors and service providers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
days outstanding on an annual basis were days on march   and  respectively 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms on customer contracts and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our operating cash flows will also be impacted in the future based on the timing of payments to our vendors 
we endeavor to pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with invoice terms and conditions

generally  our investment portfolio is classified as held to maturity 
our investments objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we generally hold investments in commercial paper  corporate bonds and united states government agency securities to maturity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook

we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions

product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable and supported and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under  i a signature license agreement  which is signed by both the customer and us  or  ii a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has either previously executed a signature license agreement with us or will receive a shrink wrap license agreement with the software 
we do not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
we determine that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable if at the outset of the customer arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
fees due under an arrangement are generally deemed fixed and determinable if they are payable within twelve months 
collectibility is probable and supported we determine whether collectibility is probable and supported on a case by case basis 
we may generate a high percentage of our license revenue from our current customer base  for whom there is a history of successful collection 
we assess the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we are unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to consulting services and post contract customer support pcs components of our license arrangements 
generally  we sell our consulting services separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over their respective terms  typically one year 
our direct customers typically enter into perpetual license arrangements 
our content components division generally enters into term based license arrangements with its customers  the term of which generally exceeds one year in length 
we recognize revenue from time based licenses at the time the license arrangement is signed  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  if the term of the time based 
table of contents license arrangement is greater than twelve months 
if the term of the time based license arrangement is twelve months or less  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license arrangement 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and pcs 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
we bill consulting services fees either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price schedule 
in general  our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and generally do not require any significant modification or alteration for customer use 
customers purchase our consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and may dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately from professional services 
we recognize revenue from consulting services as services are performed 
our customers typically purchase pcs annually  and we price pcs based on a percentage of the product license fee or percentage of product list price 
customers purchasing pcs receive product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
unspecified product upgrades are typically not provided without the purchase of pcs 
we typically have not granted specific upgrade rights in our license agreements 
specified undelivered elements are allocated a relative fair value amount within a license agreement and the revenue allocated for these elements are deferred until delivery occurs 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for amounts deemed to be uncollectible 
management specifically analyzes its accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at march  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts balance  which related to specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and to a lesser extent our historical experience applied to accounts receivable not specifically reserved  was million and million  respectively 
these amounts represent and of total gross accounts receivable at march  and  respectively 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual due to the recent economic slowdown and associated reduction in information technology spending  we implemented a series of restructuring and facility consolidation plans to improve our operating performance 
we also implemented restructuring plans related to the integration of our acquisition of optika 
restructuring and facilities consolidation costs consist of expenses associated with workforce reductions and consolidation of excess facilities 

table of contents workforce reductions in connection with our restructuring plans  we accrue for severance payments and other related termination benefits provided to employees in connection with involuntary staff reductions 
we accrue for these benefits in the period when benefits are communicated to the terminated employees 
typically  terminated employees are not required to provide continued service to receive termination benefits 
if continued service is required  then the severance liability is accrued over the required service period 
in general  we use a formula based on a combination of the number of years of service and the employee s position within the company to calculate the termination benefits to be provided to affected employees 
at march   a total million was accrued for future severance and termination benefits payments  which is payable through june excess facilities in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the lease obligations 
in determining fair value  we consider expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and related exit costs if any 
to determine the estimated sublease income  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during our evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may have suffered a reduction in their economic useful lives 
most of our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
at march   we had million accrued for excess facilities  which is payable through january we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at march   we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  consisting principally of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the company had us net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and foreign net operating losses of approximately million at march   which begin to expire in these nol s are subject to annual utilization limitations due to prior ownership changes 
realization of the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
the deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
we will continue to assess and evaluate strategies that will enable the deferred tax asset  or portion thereof  to be utilized  and will reduce the valuation allowance appropriately at such time when it is determined that the more likely than not approach is satisfied 

table of contents valuation and evaluation of impairment of long lived asset we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

this statement requires that long lived and intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we completed a physical inventory of our fixed assets which includes equipment  furniture and leasehold improvement on our leased facilities 
as a result of this physical inventory  we identified certain fixed assets which had been either decommissioned and had no value or were physically disposed of during fiscal year in accordance with sfas no 
we recorded an impairment charge of million which represented the remaining net book value of these assets as of march  valuation and evaluation goodwill and other acquired intangible assets on april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we have determined that we have two reporting units 
we performed and completed our required annual impairment testing on january  as part of this review  we engaged a independent third party valuation of the two reporting units 
upon completing our review  we determined that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill as of this date had not been impaired and no impairment charge was recorded 
we are also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired based on the factors mentioned above 
for example  if our market capitalization declines below our net book value or we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price  we will assess whether our goodwill has been impaired 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
additionally  no circumstances occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year which would have created an impairment loss at march  recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  sfas no 
requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements 
table of contents presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
statement r will  with certain exceptions  require entities that grant stock options and shares to employees to recognize the fair value of those options and shares as compensation cost over the service vesting period in their financial statements 
the measurement of that cost will be based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we are required to adopt statement r in the first interim period beginning after our fiscal year as part of this adoption  we will begin expensing our options effective april  and have also elected not to restate the prior period results 
since we will continue to issue stock options to our employees as a form of incentive compensation and because we have a significant amount of outstanding stock options that will vest on or after april   the adoption of this fasb is expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements  but the amount of the impact has not been determined 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
the guidance in apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
we are currently assessing the impact of the provisions 
the provision of sfas no 
is effective in periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

although fas no 
is effective immediately  we do not expect to be able to complete its evaluation of the repatriation provision until after the united states congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 
 however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf no 
 once final guidance is issued 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation fin r  which expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated 
we do not have any entities that required disclosure or consolidation as a result of adopting fin r 
related party transactions at march   we held investments in and notes with five non public start up technology companies  owning approximately to of these companies  and in publicly traded technology companies listed on nasdaq  primarily active iq  in which the company owned  exclusive of warrants 
investments in these companies were made with the intention of giving us opportunities to have new technologies developed for us or to give us leverage into certain vertical markets that we may not otherwise be able to obtain on our own 
at march   we had remaining value in two of these non public company investments and owned approximately to of them 
at march   our investments in these two non public companies were approximately and 
the value of these two investments at march  and was approximately million 
a permanent decline in value for these two companies of approximately million was recorded in fiscal upon our acquisition of certain assets of active iq see note to the consolidated financial statements in march  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our investment in active iq 
for substantially all of the year ended march   our investment in active iq was less than 
in fiscal  we sold this investment and recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the years ended march   and march   we entered into several sales transactions with companies affiliated with members of our board of directors 
revenues of million and million from these sales transactions was recorded during the years ended march   and march   respectively 
at march   and march   we had an account receivable balance of approximately million and million associated with these transactions  respectively 
the terms and conditions  including fees  with respect to the transactions were substantially similar to those with unaffiliated third parties negotiated at arms length 
the members of our board of directors affiliated with these companies had no direct or indirect material interest in the transactions 
there were no sales transactions with these companies during the year ended march  in march  we entered into a non exclusive reseller agreement with optika  inc  a company with which we had announced a definitive merger agreement in january and later acquired in may see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the agreement provided for the sale of optika products by us 
in the year ended march   we recognized approximately million of revenue under the agreement 
risk factors disclosure regarding forward looking statements the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
these risks include those that we consider to be significant at this time to investment decisions regarding our common stock 
there may be risks that you  in particular  view differently than we do  and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know of or that we currently deem immaterial  but that may  in fact  harm our business in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should consider carefully the following factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  in evaluating our company and business 

table of contents because our infrastructure costs are generally fixed and the timing of our revenues from quarter to quarter is highly variable  our future performance is difficult to predict  making an investment in our common stock subject to high volatility 
while our products and services are not seasonal  our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
a large part of our sales typically occurs in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter 
if these sales were delayed from one quarter to the next for any reason  our operating results could fluctuate dramatically 
in addition  our sales cycles may vary  making the timing of sales difficult to predict 
furthermore  our infrastructure costs are generally fixed 
as a result  modest fluctuations in revenues between quarters may cause large fluctuations in operating results 
these factors all tend to make the timing of revenues unpredictable and may lead to high period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for several additional reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the following demand for our products and services  the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  research and development  administration or services  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web content management solutions  the mix of revenues from product licenses and services  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  general economic conditions  and public announcements by our competitors 
we have a history of making acquisitions  including large strategic acquisitions  and future potential acquisitions may be difficult to complete or to integrate and may divert management s attention and cause our operating results to suffer 
we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity  we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for that acquisition  successfully finance the acquisition or integrate the new business or products into our existing business and operations 
in addition  the negotiation of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses or products may divert management time and resources from our existing business and operations 
to finance acquisitions  we may use a substantial portion of our available cash or we may issue additional securities  which would cause dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be profitable in the future  which would cause our financial position to suffer and may cause the market price of our stock to fall 
our revenues may not grow in future periods and we may not sustain profitability 
if we do not sustain profitability  our financial position will suffer and the market price of our stock may fall 
our ability to sustain 
table of contents profitable operations depends upon many factors beyond our direct control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the demand for our products  our ability to quickly introduce new products  the level of product and price competition  our ability to control costs  and general economic conditions 
the intense competition in our industry from recent and expected industry consolidation may reduce our future sales and profits 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is likely to become more competitive from recent and expected industry consolidation 
we may not be able to compete successfully in our chosen marketplace  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional competition may cause pricing pressure  reduced sales and margins  or prevent our products from gaining and sustaining market acceptance 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  and substantially more resources than we have 
competitors with greater resources than ours may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new opportunities  changing technology  product standards or customer requirements 
we depend on the continued service of our key personnel  if we lose the services of our key personnel our ability to execute our operating plan  and our operating results  may suffer 
we are a small company and depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if we lose any of these key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel with the highly specialized expertise necessary to generate revenue and to engineer  design and support our products and services 
like other software companies  we face intense competition for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our universal content management software  which includes our imaging and business process management software  and content component software products for our revenues  if our universal content management software and imaging and business process management software does not gain and maintain customer acceptance  our revenues and operating results may suffer 
we currently derive all of our revenues from product licenses and services associated with our system of content management  business process management and content component software products 
the market for content management and viewing software products is new and rapidly evolving 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will continue or that it will be sustainable 
if we do not increase employee productivity and revenues related to our existing products or generate revenues from new products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we will continue to depend on revenues related to new and enhanced versions of our software products for the foreseeable future 
our success will largely depend on our ability to increase sales from existing products and generate sales from product enhancements and new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in upgrading and marketing our existing products or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is subject to rapid technological change 
technological advances could make our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our business 
in addition  complex software product development involves certain inherent 
table of contents risks  including risks that errors may be found in a product enhancement or new product after its release  even after extensive testing  and the risk that discovered errors may not be corrected in a timely manner 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  which consists primarily of our proprietary software products  and do so cost effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or incur significant expense in doing so  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming and expensive 
we currently have one pending patent application  but no patent has yet been issued 
without significant patent or copyright protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who develop functionally equivalent products 
we may also be subject to claims that our current products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
any such claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we anticipate that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims due to growth in the number of products and competitors in our industry  and the overlap in functionality of products in different industries 
any infringement claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  expensive to defend  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
we rely on trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information 
despite our attempts to protect our confidential and proprietary information  others may gain access to this information 
alternatively  other companies may independently develop substantially equivalent information 
our products may not be compatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems  which may limit our ability to generate revenues from our products 
our products utilize interfaces that are compatible with commercial web browsers 
in addition  our stellent content management system is a server based system written in java that functions in both windows nt and unix environments 
we must continually modify our products to conform to commercial web browsers and operating systems 
if our products were to become incompatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems  our business would be harmed 
in addition  uncertainty related to the timing and nature of product introductions or modifications by vendors of web browsers and operating systems may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be subject to product liability claims if our software products damage customers data  fail to maintain access security or otherwise fail to perform to specifications  which could harm our operating results and financial position and reduce the value of an investment in our common stock 
if software errors or design defects in our products cause damage to customers data and our agreements do not protect us from related product liability claims  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims if our security features fail to prevent unauthorized third parties from entering our customers intranet  extranet or internet websites 
our software products are complex and sophisticated and may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors  bugs or viruses spread by third parties may result in the loss of market acceptance or the loss of customer data 
our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions where we operate 

table of contents future regulation of the internet or affecting web based communications could be adopted that restrict our business  which may limit our ability to generate revenues from our products 
federal  state or foreign agencies may adopt new legislation or regulations governing the use and quality of web content 
we cannot predict if or how any future laws or regulations would impact our business and operations 
even though these laws and regulations may not apply to our business directly  they could indirectly harm us to the extent that they impact our customers and potential customers 
we have been named a defendant in securities class action lawsuits and we may in the future be named in additional litigation  which may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
shareholder class action suits have been filed naming stellent and certain of our current and former officers and directors as co defendants 
we have reached a settlement  subject to final document and preliminary and final court approval 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their securities 
this risk is greater for technology companies  which have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
we may in the future again be the target of this kind of litigation  and such litigation could also result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to variations in our operating results  changes in the software industry and other factors  resulting in sudden changes in the market value of an investment in our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by each of the following factors  many of which are outside of our control variations in quarterly operating results  changes in estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  announcements of significant events  such as major sales  acquisitions of businesses or losses of major customers  and sales of our equity securities 
we can issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval  which could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders 
our articles of incorporation permit us to establish the rights  privileges  preferences and restrictions  including voting rights  of unissued shares of our capital stock and to issue such shares without approval from our shareholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our company  depriving shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price 

table of contents our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of minnesota law may make a takeover of stellent difficult  depriving shareholders of opportunities to sell shares at above market prices 
our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of minnesota law may have the effect of discouraging attempts to acquire stellent without the approval of our board of directors 
consequently  our shareholders may lose opportunities to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
new legislation and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future consolidated financial position and results of operations 
recently  there have been significant regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there are new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings that will have an impact on our future consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and other rule changes and proposed legislative initiatives following several highly publicized corporate accounting and corporate governance failures are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
further  in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision to statement no 
 share based payment  that will  with certain exceptions  require entities that grant stock options and shares to employees to recognize the fair value of those options and shares as compensation expense over the service period in their financial statements 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and adversely affect our consolidated operating results 
additionally  the impact of these changes may increase costs incurred by our customers and prospects  which could result in delays or cancellations in spending on enterprise content management software and services like those that we provide 
such delays and cancellations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations and financial condition 
realizing the benefits from our acquisition of optika requires us to overcome integration and other challenges which may be difficult because optika is accustomed to operating as an autonomous business 
any failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating our preexisting operations with those of optika or to realize any of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the acquisition could seriously harm our operating results 
realizing the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to overcome significant challenges  including combining optika s colorado based operations with our minnesota headquartered preexisting operations  integrating and managing the combined company with a small management team  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of optika accustomed to working without the oversight of a parent company  integrating the sales organization of optika  which historically relied extensively on indirect sales channels and generated a high proportion of maintenance and other revenues  with our preexisting sales organization  which relies extensively on direct sales and generates a high proportion of product license revenues  retaining preexisting customers of each company in light of changes that may occur as a result of the acquisition and attracting new customers while overcoming integration challenges  retaining strategic partners in light of changes that have occurred and may occur in each company s operations as a result of the acquisition and attracting new strategic partners while overcoming integration challenges  and creating and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information for two companies accustomed to operating under autonomous management 

table of contents the risks of failure to overcome these integration challenges include the potential disruption of our on going business and distraction of our management  lost sales or decreased revenues as a result of difficulties inherent in combining product offerings  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to communicate effectively our capabilities  the potential need to demonstrate to customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business  and impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect our market value 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we accounted for the acquisition of optika using the purchase method of accounting  which will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
under the purchase method of accounting  we allocated the total purchase price in the acquisition to optika s net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on their fair values as of the date of the closing of the acquisition  and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
we will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition 
in addition  to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired  we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
these depreciation  amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the fair value of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of march  dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximate average interest rate the following table presents the fair value of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of march  dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximate average interest rate our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase or decrease 
assuming an average investment balance of million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in an approximate  increase decrease in annual interest income 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 

table of contents as of march   we did not hold derivative financial instruments and have never held such instruments in the past 
foreign currency risk the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we do expect transactions in foreign currencies in  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have engaged in limited and immaterial amount of foreign currency forward contract activities to date 
commodity price risk we did not hold commodity instruments as of march   and have never had such instruments in the past
