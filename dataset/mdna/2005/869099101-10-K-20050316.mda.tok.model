table of contents the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document

critical accounting estimates susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets  and the valuation of leased asset residual values to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the treatment of securitizations and off balance sheet financing is discussed in detail in the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet vehicle lease financings 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recorded interests in securitized assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including assumptions about lease repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in assumptions  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets is considered a critical accounting estimate 
note and the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet vehicle lease financings provide additional information regarding recorded interests 
lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of the leased asset upon the expiration of the lease 
the valuation of residual assets is considered critical due to the sensitivity in forecasting the impact of product and technology changes  consumer behavior  competitor initiatives  shifts in supply and demand  and economic conditions  among other factors  on the fair value of residual assets 
we protect ourselves against this risk with a third party guarantee of residual values 
however  the future cost of this guarantee will be affected by our residual loss experience 

table of contents any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed within the body of this document 
subsequent events on january   we merged two of our subsidiary banks  first susquehanna bank and trust sunbury  pa 
and wnb bank williamsport  pa  into our susquehanna bank pa subsidiary 
as a result  the pennsylvania state chartered susquehanna bank pa will have assets of approximately billion 
this action was taken as part of the consolidation plan we announced in october in april  we plan to form our third branded bank  susquehanna bank  by combining the following subsidiaries citizens bank of southern pennsylvania greencastle  pa  farmers merchants bank and trust hagerstown  md  first american bank of pennsylvania everett  pa  and susquehanna bank towson  md on february   we acquired brandywine benefits corporation and rockford pensions  llc collectively brandywine located in wilmington  delaware 
brandywine is a financial planning  consulting and administration firm specializing in retirement benefit plans for small to medium sized businesses 
we will merge brandywine into valley forge asset management enterprises  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of our wealth management affiliate  vfam 
executive overview our business and strategy susquehanna was incorporated in pennsylvania in we manage our subsidiaries on a local community basis 
we believe that this approach differentiates us from other large competitors because it gives our subsidiaries greater flexibility to better serve their markets and increase responsiveness to the needs of local customers 
we do  however  continuously review our business in order to achieve greater economies of scale and cost savings  and to enhance earnings 
in  we began implementing our corporate wide branding and bank realignment projects  which are continuing in  with the specific goals of enhancing operational and administrative efficiencies while allowing us to further improve service to our banking customers 
in addition  the bank realignment effort will create banks of greater size  allowing us to increase our presence in target markets 
we believe the combination of all these goals will produce a number of the operational benefits of a larger organization while allowing us to continue to work effectively at the local level 
at the holding company level  we also provide our banking subsidiaries guidance in the areas of credit policy and administration  risk assessment  investment advisory administration  strategic planning  investment portfolio management  asset liability management  liquidity management and other financial and administrative services 
we seek to grow the organization profitably by increasing market share  standardizing products  closely managing yields  increasing certain lines of income while reducing the proportional contribution of others as appropriate  consider acquisitions that fit our business model and future direction  and controlling expenses 
we believe the branding strategy and bank realignment projects are two significant steps forward towards many of these objectives 
as a billion asset financial holding company operating in multiple states  we seek to attain diversified revenue streams and income 
at december   we had eight commercial banks  a trust and investment company  an asset management company  a property and casualty insurance brokerage company  a commercial leasing company and a vehicle leasing company 
these businesses have specific metrics by which management evaluates their performance 
we believe this diversification strategy allows us to extend additional services to our customers and opportunities to our shareholders 
we manage our business for sustained long term growth and profitability 
our primary strategies are internal growth through expansion of our customer base in existing markets and external growth through acquisitions in selected markets 
we focus on leveraging customer relationships by cross selling a comprehensive range of financial services and products by a highly trained and motivated employee sales force 

table of contents in  we implemented a long term strategic plan to enhance shareholder value 
its three main components are growing our business profitably through the specific methods mentioned above  developing our sales culture  and focusing on risk management 
integrated into our strategic plan under these components are various company wide initiatives that we believe are important to achieving our plan  including technology  rewards  teamwork  training  communications and organizational structure 
trends and events we met most of our financial goals set for the banks and wealth management improved as planned in total deposits on an organic basis grew in loans and leases on an organic basis grew 
our target for both of these areas for was 
wealth management slightly exceeded billion in assets under management and administration 
our target for was to reach billion 
if not for the underperformance of our auto leasing business  hann financial  we would have achieved each of our publicly stated goals 
while hann has been accretive to earnings from to by cents per share  it was cents dilutive to earnings per share for we are working on several improvements to hann s business plan including new revenue producing initiatives and a new process to attain better execution of securitization transactions 
additionally  auto lenders  hann s third party residual value guarantor  has established a fourth retail facility and will bring on line a new central vehicle reconditioning center in the second quarter of approximately of our revenue is derived from the banks  where we are seeking to increase income through a variety of means 
susquehanna seeks net income through diversified  quality revenues 
our major source of operating revenues is net interest income  which is largely derived from our banking operations 
as a result  net interest income and many of its components are important metrics by which management evaluates our banks and the holding company s return on its investments 
noninterest income is derived across multiple business units including but not limited to our banks  wealth management and insurance organizations  and automobile leasing business 
we have sought to increase the proportional contribution of noninterest income through targeted efforts that would increase fee income  most specifically from our wealth management organization 
the wealth management organization experienced robust growth in  increasing assets  to billion at december  our acquisition of the brandywine benefits corporation and rockford pensions  llc on february   is an example of how we try to enhance this area and our noninterest income opportunities 
we look to increase revenue and income through revenue generation efforts and efficiency improvements 
the efficiency ratio is an important metric for our industry and for us as it measures how well we are accomplishing these objectives 
we consider two efficiency ratios when we evaluate the overall business efficiency ratio including hann and efficiency ratio excluding hann 
efficiency ratio excluding hann is a non gaap financial measure 
for disclosures relating to this ratio  see the section entitled supplemental reporting of non gaap financial measures on the following page 
efficiency ratio including hann for was 
organizations with significant nonbank fee income generating operations generally have higher efficiency ratios 
our efficiency ratio excluding hann improved to for  from in susquehanna has targeted an efficiency ratio excluding hann of for management believes efficiency ratio excluding hann to be the preferred measurement because it excludes the volatility of full term ratios  securitization gains  and residual values of hann and provides more focused visibility into our core business activities 
results of operations acquisition of patriot bank corp 
on june   we completed our acquisition of patriot bank corp patriot 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and all transactions since that date are included in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents summary of compared to net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over net income of million 
net interest income increased to million for  from million in our earnings performance continues to be enhanced by improvements in non interest income  which  during the year  equaled of total revenues and increased million over non interest expenses increased  to million for  from million for additional information is as follows twelve months ended december  diluted earnings per share return on average assets return on average equity return on average tangible equity efficiency ratio efficiency ratio excluding hann the following discussion details the factors that contributed to these results 
supplemental reporting of non gaap financial measures susquehanna has presented a return on average tangible equity  which is a non gaap financial measure and is most directly comparable to the gaap measurement of return on average equity 
for purposes of computing return on average tangible equity  we have excluded the balance of intangible assets and their related amortization expense from our calculation of return on average tangible equity to allow us to review the core operating results of our company 
this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
a reconciliation of return on average tangible equity to return on average equity is set forth below 
return on average equity gaap basis effect of excluding average intangible assets and related amortization return on average tangible equity susquehanna has presented an efficiency ratio excluding hann  which is a non gaap financial measure and is most directly comparable to the gaap presentation of efficiency ratio 
we measure our efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income  on an fte basis  and noninterest income 
the presentation of an efficiency ratio excluding hann is computed as the efficiency ratio excluding the effects of our auto leasing subsidiary  hann 
management believes this to be a preferred measurement because it excludes the volatility of full term ratios  securitization gains  and residual values of hann and provides more focused visibility into our core business activities 
a reconciliation of efficiency ratio excluding hann to efficiency ratio is set forth below 
efficiency ratio gaap basis effect of excluding hann efficiency ratio excluding hann net interest income taxable equivalent basis our major source of operating revenues is net interest income  which increased in  to million  as compared to the million attained in net interest income as a percentage of net interest income plus other income was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents net interest income is the income that remains after deducting  from total income generated by earning assets  the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets 
income from earning assets includes income from loans  investment securities  and short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and the levels of non performing loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  the rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity capital 
table presents average balances  taxable equivalent interest income and expense and yields earned or paid on these assets and liabilities 
for purposes of calculating taxable equivalent interest income  tax exempt interest has been adjusted using a marginal tax rate of in order to equate the yield to that of taxable interest rates 
table illustrates the changes in net interest income caused by changes in average volume  rates  and yields 
the increase in our net interest income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of the net contribution from interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities acquired from patriot 
in addition  since we are an asset sensitive institution  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities  we experienced modest improvements in our net interest margin in the third and fourth quarters of  due to recent increases in interest rates 
these improvements  however  have not been enough to significantly offset the decline experienced in the first half of  and consequently  our net interest margin for decreased five basis points  to  from for we believe that the federal reserve will continue to raise the federal funds target rate in small increments throughout  and as a result  we anticipate additional improvement in our net interest margin 
variances do occur in the net interest margin  as an exact repricing of assets and liabilities is not possible 
a further explanation of the impact of asset and liability repricing is found in the section titled market risks

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans and leases  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan and lease growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are internally risk rated  using a standard rating system  by our loan officers and periodically reviewed by loan quality personnel 
consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases are generally analyzed in the aggregate as they are of relatively small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 
in  we changed the methodology for calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses 
under this new methodology  loss rates for the last three years on a rolling quarter to quarter basis are determined for a commercial credits including agriculture  commercial  commercial real estate  land acquisition  development and construction and b consumer credits including residential real estate  consumer direct  consumer indirect  consumer revolving  and leases 
the loss rates are calculated for each affiliate bank  and they are applied to loan balances of the portfolio segments described above 

table of contents in addition to using loss rates  non accrual loans of million or greater are reviewed for impairment as required under fas no 
those loans that have specific loss allocations are identified and included in the reserve allocation 
risk rated loans that are not reviewed for impairment are segregated into homogeneous pools with loss allocation rates that reflect the severity of risk 
loss rates are adjusted by applying other factors to the calculations 
these factors include adjustment for current economic trends  delinquency and risk trends  credit concentrations  credit administration and other special allocations for unusual events or changes in products 
the methodology provides a more in depth analysis of the portfolios of our banks and better reflects the estimated losses within the various portfolios 
reserve allocations are then reviewed and consolidated 
this process is performed on a quarterly basis  including a risk rated review of commercial credit relationships at the banking affiliates 
prior to  we did not have a standard risk rating system for affiliate banks 
the banks used their own methodology for calculating the allowance  and loss data was not broken out in as many categories  particularly real estate loans  because the data was not available 
table  allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses  reflects comparative data for  and using the revised methodology 
the prior years allocations for real estate in total are consistent 
if data were available  and we could retroactively apply our current methodology to prior years  we believe the allocation between the categories of real estate construction and real estate mortgage would be consistent with   and allocations 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given point in time is difficult  particularly during uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan and lease portfolios is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in our opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to meet probable loan and lease losses at december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not sustain losses in future periods that could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  as illustrated in table  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for and million in this million decrease in the provision is the result of the continuing strength of our asset quality as evidenced by the decrease in total non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases plus other real estate owned  from at december   to at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was of period end loans and leases  or million  compared with or million at december  should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers may experience increasing difficulty in meeting their payment obligations  and the level of non performing loans and assets  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
it is our policy not to renegotiate the terms of a commercial loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a commercial loan is typically transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is considered delinquent in payment if either principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest income received on impaired commercial loans in and was million and million  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these impaired loans 
consumer loans are typically charged off at days past due unless they are secured by real estate 
loans secured by real estate are evaluated on the basis of collateral value 
loans that are well secured may continue to accrue interest while other loans are charged down to net realizable value or placed on non accrual depending upon their loan to value ratio 

table of contents table is an analysis of the provision levels as well as the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
table reflects the five year history of non performing assets and loans and leases contractually past due days and not placed on non accrual 
at december   non performing assets totaled million and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure and a million restructured loan 
at december   we had a restructured loan totaling million with a long time borrower 
however  in accordance with fas no  information about a restructured loan involving a modification of terms need not be included in disclosures in years after the restructuring if the restructuring agreement has market terms  including a market rate of interest  and the restructured loan is current and is expected to perform in accordance with the modified terms 
the removal of this restructured loan from nonperforming assets in january  contributed to the ratio changes noted above

prior to foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if necessary  to fair value by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income  and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest were million at december   an increase from the million at december  a softening of certain segments of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on non accrual status because of uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
these loans  which are not included in table  totaled million at december   and at december  we do not consider this increase to be indicative of any particular trends  as changes to risk ratings occur in the normal course of business 
depending upon the state of the economy and the impact thereon to these borrowers  as well as future events  such as regulatory examination assessments  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future 
noninterest income noninterest income consists of the following service charges on deposit accounts  asset management fees  fees for trust services  vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees  
table of contents income generated from bank owned life insurance and reinsurance activities  commissions and fees on casualty and property insurance  commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales  net gains on security transactions  net gains on sales of loans  and other miscellaneous income  such as fees for sales of travelers checks and money orders  safe deposit box rents  and net gains on the sale of other real estate and branch offices 
noninterest income  as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income  was  and for   and  respectively 
noninterest income increased million  or  in  over this net increase is composed primarily of the following increased service charges on deposit accounts of million  increased asset management fees of million  increased commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales of million  increased income from bank owned life insurance of million  increased net gains on sales of securities of million  net gains on the sales of branch deposits of million included in other  and decreased vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees of million 
service charges on deposit accounts 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts is directly related to the acquisition of patriot and to the increase in demand deposits  from million at december   to million at december  asset management fees and commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales 
as part of our strategy to increase other fee based income  we continued to focus on enhancing the wealth management aspect of our business 
as a result  asset management fees increased  as assets under management at vfam increased  to billion at december   from billion at december  the patriot acquisition contributed million to the increase in assets under management 
commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales increased  to million for  from million for income from bank owned life insurance 
the increase in income from bank owned life insurance for can be attributed to the purchase of million of life insurance in the third quarter of  million in the first quarter of  and million in the third quarter of in addition  we acquired million of bank owned life insurance through the patriot acquisition 
net gains on sales of securities 
in july and august of  as part of a restructuring of our investment portfolio in response to the patriot acquisition and eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we sold approximately million in securities and realized a net  pre tax gain of approximately million 
net gains on the sales of branch deposits 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we sold four branch locations of several banking subsidiaries 
we realized an aggregate net pre tax gain of million on the sale of their deposits  totaling million  to other financial institutions 
these sales were part of our effort to enhance the efficiency of our branch network through our previously announced plans to consolidate and or sell several locations 

table of contents for  we plan to sell seven more branches with aggregate deposits of approximately million with an estimated pre tax gain on the sales of million 
we expect to incur costs associated with the sales and other branch consolidations of approximately million with resultant cost savings  from both sales and consolidations  of approximately million in vehicle origination  securitization  and servicing fees 
the decrease in vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees was primarily due to a reduction in securitization fees as a result of the roll off of earlier securitizations and lower lease origination volumes 
noninterest expenses non interest expenses are categorized into the following groupings employee related expenses  which includes salaries  benefits  and employment taxes  occupancy expenses  which includes depreciation  rents  maintenance  utilities  and insurance  furniture and equipment expenses  which includes depreciation  rents  and maintenance  amortization of intangible assets  vehicle residual value expense  vehicle delivery and preparation expense  and other expenses detailed in table incurred in the operation of our business 
table analysis of other expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands advertising  marketing  and public relations communications fdic and other insurance legal and consulting postage and delivery all other total noninterest expenses increased million  or  in  over salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  increased million  or  from to the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily the result of the patriot acquisition  normal annual salary increases  new revenue producing positions  and higher benefit costs 
charges for occupancy increased million  or  in  from the increase can be attributed to the patriot acquisition and general increases in the costs of doing business  predominantly in the categories of rent expense and real estate taxes 
vehicle delivery and preparation expense for increased million over the prior year s expense due to an increase in the number of vehicles that were turned in at the end of the lease and needed to be prepared for sale  as opposed to being purchased by the lessee 
we believe that the increase in the number of vehicles that were turned in at the end of the lease was caused by new car manufacturers continuing to offer attractive financing incentives 
for  auto lenders  hann s third party residual value guarantor  will open a new central vehicle reconditioning center which  along with fewer vehicle leases scheduled to mature in  is expected to decrease our vehicle delivery and preparation expense by approximately million in offsetting this improvement will be an estimated million increase in vehicle residual value expense for however  based upon servicing agreements with auto lenders  our vehicle residual value guarantee expense will decline by million in and by another million in 
table of contents all other expenses increased million  net see table 
the inclusion of patriot operations since june   contributed to a general increase in all expense categories 
in addition  we incurred expenses relating to our branding initiative of million and expenses relating to our bank realignment project of million 
for  we anticipate incurring branding initiative costs of approximately million 
we estimate that bank realignment related costs in will be million and concomitant savings will be million 
income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate for was primarily related to increased tax advantaged income as a result of the patriot acquisition and additional purchases of bank owned life insurance

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this accounting pronouncement requires the segregation of investment securities into three categories  each having a distinct accounting treatment held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 

table of contents securities identified as held to maturity continue to be carried at their amortized cost and  except for limited circumstances  may not be sold prior to maturity 
securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost is recorded in the equity section  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income 
as a result  our total equity was negatively impacted by million as the unrealized losses  net of taxes  on available for sale securities increased slightly  from a loss of million at december   to a loss of million at december  this increased loss was due to the interest rate environment 
investment securities available for sale increased million from december   to december  as part of the patriot acquisition  we acquired million in available for sale securities  however  in july and august of  as part of a restructuring of our investment portfolio in anticipation of the ramifications of eitf  we sold approximately million of these securities 
securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market with the change recorded in the income statement 
presently  we do not engage in trading activity  but we do engage in active portfolio management  that requires the majority of our security portfolios to be identified as available for sale 
while fas requires segregation into held to maturity and available for sale categories see table  it does not change our policy concerning the purchase of only high quality securities 
strategies employed address liquidity  capital adequacy and net interest margin considerations  which then determine the assignment of purchases into these two categories 
table illustrates the maturities of these security portfolios and the weighted average yields based upon amortized costs 
yields are shown on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate 
at december   we held no securities of one issuer  other than u

of this net increase  million was in brokered certificates of deposit  which are being utilized as an alternative funding source to support the increase in our loan portfolio 
we believe that the remainder of the net increase is a direct result of the continuing success of our bank subsidiaries in carrying out our retail and corporate sales initiatives

table of contents capital adequacy risk based capital ratios  based upon guidelines adopted by bank regulators in  focus upon credit risk 
assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalent before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 
capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents shareholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures reduced by excludable intangibles 
tier capital represents certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the parent company level as well as at each bank affiliate is an important aspect of our philosophy 
we  and each of our bank subsidiaries  have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
market risks the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include equity market price risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of our operations  foreign currency and commodity price risk are not significant to us 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk related to market fluctuations of equity prices in the securities markets 
while we do not have significant risk in our investment portfolio  market price fluctuations may affect fee income generated through our asset management operations 
generally  our fee structure is based on the market value of assets being managed at specific time frames 
if market values decline  our fee income may also decline 
liquidity risk the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of our customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of our asset liability management strategy 
our policy of diversifying our funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows us to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   our bank subsidiaries had approximately million available to them under collateralized lines of credit with various fhlbs  and million more was available provided that additional collateral had been pledged 
liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing our liability balances 
liquidity is also evaluated by taking into consideration maturing or readily marketable assets 
unrestricted short term investments amounted to million for the year ended december  and represented additional sources of liquidity 

table of contents interest rate risk the management of interest rate risk focuses on controlling the risk to net interest income and the associated net interest margin as the result of changing market rates and spreads 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the repricing and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
our goal is to control risk exposure to changing rates within management s accepted guidelines to maintain an acceptable level of risk exposure in support of consistent earnings 
we employ a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
these methods include basic gap analysis  which points to directional exposure  routine rate shocks simulation  and evaluation of the change in economic value of equity 
board directed guidelines have been adopted for both the rate shock simulations and economic value of equity exposure limits 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups  fixed rate  floating rate and those which reprice only at our discretion  strategies are developed to control the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
our interest rate risk using the static gap analysis is presented in table this method reports the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a specific point in time 
management uses the static gap methodology to identify our directional interest rate risk 
table also illustrates our estimated interest rate sensitivity periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated as of december  and these estimates include anticipated prepayments on commercial and residential loans  mortgage backed securities  in addition to certain repricing assumptions relative to our core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
static gap analysis is widely accepted because of its simplicity in identifying interest rate risk exposure  but it ignores market spread adjustments  the changing mix of the balance sheet  planned balance sheet management strategies  and the change in prepayment assumptions

the financial simulation model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities and equity at current and forecasted interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on embedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic values of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing embedded options  which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit  and the availability of refinancing at attractive terms in addition to general changes in customers needs 
refinancing may also depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short term and long term interest rates 
changes in market rates and general economic conditions will have an impact on an organization s mortgage backed security portfolio 
this will have an associated change on our sensitivity position in changing economic times 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice 
a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  
table of contents while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
our floating rate loan portfolio is primarily indexed to national interest rate indices 
the portfolio is funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings 
a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes to the different indices resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from such financial instruments 
basis risk is the result of this inconsistent change in the indices  with historical relationships not always being a good indicator 
tables and reflect the estimated income effect and economic value of assets  liabilities and equity calculated using certain assumptions we determined as of december   and  at then current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates in and increments 
as noted in table  the economic value of equity at risk as of december  is  at an interest rate change of positive  while table discloses that net interest income at risk as of december  is  at an interest rate change of positive 
the positive rate scenarios are considered more likely  as we and most economists believe that the federal reserve will continue to increase short term interest rates throughout  putting upward pressure on the long term interest rates  as well 
at december   we were an asset sensitive institution and should benefit from a continued rise in interest rates in  if that should occur

in an effort to manage this risk  in the third quarter of  hann entered into a servicing agreement with auto lenders liquidation center  inc auto lenders pursuant to which hann effectively transferred to auto lenders all residual value risk of the managed auto lease portfolio originated by hann  and all residual value risk on any new leases originated over the term of the agreement 
auto lenders  which was formed in  is a used vehicle remarketer with three retail locations in new jersey and has access to various wholesale facilities throughout the country 
under this servicing agreement  auto lenders agrees to purchase the beneficial interest in all vehicles returned by the obligors at the scheduled expiration of the related leases for a purchase price equal to the stated residual value of such vehicles 
further  hann agrees to set its stated residual values of new leases in accordance with the standards approved in advance by auto lenders 
hann also agrees to make monthly guaranty payments to auto lenders based upon a negotiated schedule covering a three year period 
at the end of each year  the servicing agreement may be renewed by the mutual agreement of the parties for an additional one year term  beyond the current three year term  subject to renegotiation of the payments for the additional year 
during the renewal process  hann periodically obtains competitive quotes from third parties to determine the best remarketing alternative for hann 
securitizations and off balance sheet vehicle lease financings background asset securitizations and other off balance sheet financings can further affect liquidity and interest rate risk 
in order to facilitate these financings  hann formed hann auto trust  a delaware statutory trust the origination trust  in hann purchases vehicles and related leases directly from motor vehicle dealers 
the motor vehicle dealers title these vehicles in the name of the origination trust at the time of the purchase 
titles to the vehicles and the leases are then held by the origination trust  and the origination trust acts as lessor under the leases 
hann initially owns the beneficial interest in all leases and related vehicles 
hann s beneficial interest is often referred to as the undivided trust interest or uti 
hann creates and transfers beneficial interests in the origination trust that represent just the rights in the pool of leases and related vehicles included in securitization  sale leaseback  agency  and other transactions through a special unit of beneficial interest called a subi 
there is no need to undertake the effort and expense of retitling the vehicles because the legal owner of the vehicles  the origination trust  does not change 
at any time  a lease and related vehicle will be allocated to the uti  and then to a subi  if it is beneficially owned by a securitization entity  a third party  or otherwise included in a financing transaction 

table of contents automobile leases originated by the origination trust are financed primarily in four ways securitization transactions  agency arrangements with  and lease sales to  other financial institutions  sale leaseback transactions  and other sources of funds  including internally generated sources 
assets financed through the use of the first three methods generally are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december  and  hann s managed portfolio was comprised of the following as of december  as of december  securitization transactions million million agency arrangements and lease sales million million sale leaseback transactions million million leases and loans held in portfolio million million total leases and loans serviced  billion  billion all of hann s securitizations and off balance sheet financings primarily are done to fund the assets originated by the origination trust and in some cases  to enable susquehanna to more efficiently utilize its required regulatory capital 
securitization transactions in connection with its securitization transactions  hann transfers beneficial interests in automobile leases and related vehicles originated by the origination trust to a wholly owned  qualified special purpose entity each  a qspe 
these transactions are accounted for as sales under the guidelines of sfas hann acts as servicer for the securitized portfolio and receives a servicing fee based upon a percentage of the value of assets serviced 
neither hann nor susquehanna provides recourse for losses resulting from defaults under the leases 
each securitization transaction also provides that the beneficial interest in any leases and related vehicles that fail to meet the factual representations about those assets made by hann in each transaction must be repurchased by hann and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust 
each qspe retains the right to receive excess cash flows from the sold portfolio 
under sfas  hann is required to recognize a receivable representing the present value of these excess cash flows each  a pv receivable  which is subordinate to the rights of each qspe s creditors 
the value of this recorded pv receivable is subject to credit  prepayment and interest rate risk 
the leases  for accounting purposes  are treated as direct financing receivables as a result of a residual purchase agreement with auto lenders 
although neither hann nor susquehanna has retained residual value risk in the automobile leases and related vehicles  in the event of a breach by auto lenders  a qspe may suffer residual losses  which we expect would decrease the value of the pv receivable recognized by hann 
as of december   the aggregate amount of all such recorded pv receivables in connection with hann securitizations was million 
summary of securitization transactions late in the third quarter of  hann entered into a revolving securitization transaction the transaction 
in connection with this transaction  hann sells and contributes beneficial interests in automobile leases and related vehicles to a wholly owned qspe 
from time to time  the qspe may purchase the beneficial interests in additional automobile leases and related vehicles from hann 
transfers to the qspe are accounted for as sales under the guidelines of fas no 
the qspe finances the purchases by borrowing funds in an amount up to million from a non related  asset backed commercial paper issuer the lender 
during the fourth quarter of  hann made transfers to the qspe of beneficial interests in million in automobile 
table of contents leases and related vehicles 
neither hann nor susquehanna provides recourse for credit losses 
however  the qspe s obligation to pay hann the servicing fee each month is subordinate to the qspe s obligation to pay interest  principal and fees due on the loans 
therefore  if the qspe suffers credit losses on its assets  it may have insufficient funds to pay the servicing fee to hann 
additionally  if an early amortization event were to occur under the qspe s loan agreement  hann  as servicer  would not receive payments of the servicing fee until all interest  principal and fees due on the loans have been paid although the servicing fee will continue to accrue 
in connection with the transaction  susquehanna has entered into a back up servicing agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to service the automobile leases and related vehicles beneficially owned by the qspe if hann is terminated as servicer 
if susquehanna were appointed servicer  it would receive a servicing fee each month 
the debt issued in the revolving securitization transaction will bear a floating rate of interest 
in this transaction  the qspe is required to obtain an interest rate hedge agreement if the weighted average fixed interest rate of its assets is less than a targeted portfolio yield calculated monthly and if the funds on deposit in a yield supplement account established by the qspe are less than a targeted amount 
neither hann nor susquehanna has any obligation to obtain such a hedge agreement for the qspe  but the failure of the qspe to obtain the required hedge agreement could be an event of default under its loan documents 
the transaction documents for the revolving transaction contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions and consequences  including events of default  which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold portfolio to meet certain performance tests 
that transaction also provides that any assets that fail to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in that transaction must be repurchased by hann and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust 
summary of prior years securitization transactions in july  hann entered into a term securitization transaction the transaction 
in this transaction  hann sold and contributed the beneficial interest in million in automobile leases and related vehicles to a wholly owned qspe 
the qspe financed the purchase of the beneficial interest primarily by issuing million of asset backed notes 
the initial recorded pv receivable for this transaction was million  and the fair value of this pv receivable at december  was million 
during the third quarter of  hann entered into a revolving securitization transaction and sold and contributed beneficial interests in automobile leases and related vehicles to a wholly owned qspe 
from time to time  the qspe may purchase the beneficial interests in additional automobile leases and related vehicles from hann

the qspe finances the purchases by borrowing funds in an amount up to million from a non related  asset backed commercial paper issuer a lender  however  the lender is not committed to make loans to the qspe 
during  hann transferred to the qspe the beneficial interest in million in automobile leases and related vehicles 
neither hann nor susquehanna provides recourse for credit losses

table of contents the transaction documents for the revolving securitization transaction contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions and consequences  including events of default  which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold portfolio to meet certain performance tests 
that transaction also provides that any assets that fail to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in that transaction must be repurchased by hann and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust 
in june  hann issued a cleanup call to purchase the remaining balance of a transaction 
a cleanup call is issued when the amount of outstanding assets falls to a specified level at which the cost of servicing those assets becomes burdensome 
as a result  hann acquired million in auto leases 
agency agreements and lease sales agency arrangements and lease sales generally occur on economic terms similar to vehicle lease terms and generally result in no accounting gains or losses to hann and no retention of credit  residual value  or interest rate risk with respect to the sold assets 
agency arrangements involve the origination and servicing by hann of automobile leases for other financial institutions  and lease sales involve the sale of previously originated leases with servicing retained to other financial institutions 
hann generally is entitled to receive all of the administrative fees collected from obligors  a servicing fee and  in the case of agency arrangements  an origination fee per lease 
lease sales are generally accounted for as sales under fas during the second quarter of  hann entered into an agency arrangement 
in connection with that arrangement  we entered into an agreement under which we guarantee auto lenders performance of its obligations to the new agency client the residual interest agreement 
auto lenders has agreed to purchase leased vehicles in the agency client s portfolio at the termination of the leases for the full residual value of those vehicles 
in the event the agency client incurs any losses  costs or expenses as a result of any failure of auto lenders to perform this purchase obligation  we will compensate the agency client for any final liquidation losses with respect to such leased vehicle 
however  our liability is limited to of the maximum aggregate residual value of all leases purchased by the agency client 
at december   the total residual value of the vehicles in the portfolio for this transaction was million  and our maximum obligation under the residual interest agreement at december   was million 
sale leaseback transactions in december  hann sold and contributed the beneficial interest in million of automobiles and related auto leases owned by the origination trust to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the lessee 
the lessee sold such beneficial interests to a lessor the lessor  and the lessor in turn leased the beneficial interests in the automobiles and auto leases back to the lessee under a master lease agreement that has an eight year term 
for accounting purposes  the sale leaseback transaction between the lessee and the lessor is treated as a sale and an operating lease and qualifies as a sale and leaseback under fas no 
the lessor is a delaware statutory trust and a variable interest entity a vie 
the lessor held the beneficial interest in vehicles and auto leases with a remaining balance of approximately million at december  to support its obligations under the master lease agreement  at closing the lessee pledged the beneficial interest in an additional million of automobile leases and related vehicles  which were also sold or contributed to the lessee 
at december   the beneficial interest in additional automobile leases and related vehicles pledged by the lessee was million 
under the sale leaseback transaction discussed above  the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences that become applicable upon the occurrence of an early amortization event 
after an early amortization event  the lessee can no longer make substitutions under the master lease agreement  which means that the sales proceeds from the sold vehicles following termination of the related auto leases may not be used to purchase replacement vehicles and leases 
instead  the sales proceeds and other amounts are used to make termination and other related payments under the master lease agreement  which would reduce the income the lessee is expected to earn over the term of the master lease agreement 
these 
table of contents termination and other related payments are amounts sufficient to permit the lessor to repay its outstanding debt  including any necessary makewhole amounts  to return to the lessor s equity investors their invested capital  and to compensate the lessor s equity investors for their early return of cash and their loss of tax benefits 
any termination with respect to particular vehicles would relieve the lessee from the obligation to pay rent with respect to that vehicle 
makewhole amounts would be necessary only if the level of interest rates were lower at the time of the termination payment than the level of interest at the commencement of the transaction 
in addition  if the lessee were unable to substitute new vehicles for terminated vehicles  we would be entitled to take depreciation deductions for tax purposes on the vehicles that were not substituted 
we believe that the likelihood of occurrence of any early amortization event is remote 
the precise amount of these termination and other related payments is subject to a great deal of variability and depends significantly on future interest rates  the sales proceeds for the respective vehicles  the termination dates at which consumer leases terminate  and the length of the remaining term of the master lease agreement at the time of the early amortization event 
it is virtually impossible to calculate the amount of these termination payments 
even if an early amortization event were to occur  susquehanna would expect that the present value of these payments would not exceed the present value of the rent avoided and tax benefits gained by a material amount 
an early amortization event includes the failure of the sold and pledged portfolios to meet certain performance tests or the failure of susquehanna to continue to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
in addition  if susquehanna fails to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings  then susquehanna must obtain a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction to secure its obligations under the guarantee discussed below 
at the end of the lease term under the master lease agreement  the lessee has agreed to act as a remarketing agent for the lessor if the lessor decides to sell the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles 
the lessee has agreed that  if the aggregate net proceeds of such sale are less then the lease end value of the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles at that time  the lessee will pay to the lessor the excess  if any  of the lease end value over the aggregate net proceeds of such sale 
lease end value is the lower of i the aggregate wholesale clean value of the vehicles as shown in the black book official used car market guide monthly or ii million 
if the leases and related vehicles were to be worthless at such time  the maximum exposure to susquehanna and its subsidiaries under these provisions would be million 
the servicing agreement with auto lenders does not apply to the sale leaseback transaction 
under the master lease agreement  the lessee has an early buyout option on january  the ebo date under which the lessee can repurchase all  but not less than all  of the beneficial interests in leases and related vehicles 
if the option is exercised  the lessee will pay to the lessor the purchase price under the early buyout option the ebo price 
the ebo price may  at the lessee s option  be payable either on the ebo date or  if our senior unsecured long term debt rating on the ebo date is at least baa and not on negative credit watch with negative implications by moody s and bbb by standard poor s and not on credit watch with negative implications and certain other conditions are met  in installments 
the lessee must also pay the out of pocket costs and expenses including all transfer taxes and legal fees and expenses incurred by the lessor  the trustees and their affiliates in connection with such purchase 
servicing fees under the securitization transactions  the sale leaseback transaction  agency agreements  and lease sales servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the sale of financial assets 
the servicing fees paid to hann under the securitization transactions  the sale leaseback transaction  agency agreements  and lease sales approximate current market value and hann s servicing costs 
consequently  hann records no servicing asset or liability with regard to those transactions because its expected servicing costs are approximately equal to its expected servicing income 
we enter into securitization transactions primarily to achieve low cost funding for the growth of our auto lease portfolio  and not primarily to maximize our ongoing servicing fee revenue 
in the future  if servicing costs were to exceed servicing income  hann would record the present value of that liability as an expense  if servicing income were to exceed servicing costs  hann would record the present value of that asset as income 

table of contents our policy regarding the impairment of servicing assets is to evaluate the assets based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics which affect their current value  such as interest rates and terms 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual stratum  to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the stratum 
for the reasons discussed above  we presently have no recorded servicing rights  and therefore  no associated impairment allowance 
summary of susquehanna s potential exposure under off balance sheet vehicle lease financings as of december  securitization transactions as a result of the june clean up call discussed above  the reimbursement obligations under the transaction to a lender under a letter of credit facility have terminated 
sale leaseback transaction under the existing sale leaseback transaction  we guarantee certain obligations of the lessee  which is a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of hann 
if we fail to maintain our investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings  then we must obtain a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction to secure our obligations under the guarantee 
we also have obtained from a third party an million letter of credit for the benefit of an equity participant if we fail to make payments under the guarantee 
additionally  as discussed above  the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences that become applicable upon the occurrence of an early amortization event  as described above 
the precise amount of the termination and other related payments is subject to a great deal of variability and depends significantly on future interest rates  the sales proceeds for the respective vehicles  the termination dates at which consumer leases terminate  and the length of the remaining term of the master lease agreement at the time of the early amortization event 
it is virtually impossible to calculate the amount of the termination payments 
even if an early amortization event were to occur  we would expect that the present value of these payments would not exceed the present value of the rent avoided and tax benefits gained by a material amount 
we believe that the occurrence of any early amortization event is remote 
at the end of the lease term under the master lease agreement  the lessee has agreed to act as a remarketing agent for the lessor if the lessor decides to sell the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles 
the lessee has agreed that if the aggregate net proceeds of such sale are less then the lease end value of the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles at that time  the lessee will pay to the lessor the excess  if any  of the lease end value over the aggregate net proceeds of such sale 
if the leases and related vehicles were to be worthless at such time  the maximum exposure to susquehanna and its subsidiaries under these provisions would be million 
agency agreements and lease sales under the agency arrangements  our maximum obligation under the residual interest agreement at december  was million 
miscellaneous additionally  we are required to maintain contingent vehicle liability insurance coverage with regard to most of these transactions 
this same coverage is also maintained on vehicles within our own portfolio 
because a majority of the vehicles are leased in the state of new york  a vicarious liability state  the ability to maintain our coverage or the premium cost could potentially have a negative impact on susquehanna 
the basic coverage policy is renewable annually and expires in

in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive the majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance 
as of december   we had variable interests in securitization entities and the lessor in a sale leaseback transaction 
these securitization entities are qualifying special purpose entities qspe  which are exempt from the consolidation requirements of fin the lessor in the sale leaseback transaction is not a qspe  however  under the guidelines set forth in fin  consolidation of this entity is not required

the decrease in our net interest income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of average yields on earning assets declining more than the average cost of deposits  as interest rates remained at their lowest level in decades 
contributing to the over all decrease in average yields was the rapid amortization of premiums paid for mortgage backed securities due to a significant amount of prepayments caused by a reduction in long term interest rates in the second quarter of in addition  the sale of approximately million in mortgage backed securities during the third quarter of and the subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds in tax advantaged bank owned life insurance negatively impacted the net interest margin  since income from bank owned life insurance is classified as noninterest income as opposed to interest income 
as a result  this purchase of bank owned life insurance had a positive impact on noninterest income 
since we were an asset sensitive institution  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities  the net interest margin experienced further compression as interest rates declined and decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  average interest earning assets grew by million in over  while average interest bearing liabilities grew by million for the same time period 
the growth in average interest earning assets was due to a million increase in average loans and leases and a million increase in our average investment portfolio

the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets for decreased to from in  while the average cost of funds decreased to in from in due to declines in interest rates

this loan  secured by a hotel facility in our marketplace  was classified as a potential problem loan at december  the borrower was not delinquent under the modified terms as of december  this restructured loan was the primary reason for the ratio changes noted in the above paragraph 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest were million at december   a decrease from the million at december  potential problem loans consisted of loans that were performing under contract but for which potential credit problems caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
such loans amounted to million at december  and at december  we did not consider this increase to be significant nor indicative of any particular trends  as changes to risk ratings occur in the normal course of business 
noninterest income noninterest income increased million  or  in over service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in over in response to the increase in demand deposits during the same time period 
the acquisition of addis  completed in june  contributed an increase of million to noninterest income in the form of commissions and fees on property and casualty insurance 
vehicle origination and servicing fees rose million  primarily as a result of increased volumes for in september  we exited the merchant credit card business to reduce our risk relating to the travel industry

income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective rate for was primarily related to a tax benefit recognized in connection with the favorable resolution of a federal income tax examination

further increases in income tax expense in the states in which we do business would continue to reduce after tax returns  as well 
financial condition total assets at december  were billion  an increase of  as compared to total assets of billion at december  loans and leases increased to billion at december  from billion at december   while deposits increased to billion from billion during the same time period

as a result  our total equity was negatively impacted by million as the unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  for available for sale securities decreased from a gain of million at december  to a loss of million at december  this decrease was due to a volatile interest rate environment 
investment securities available for sale decreased million from december  to december  this decrease was primarily the result of rapid prepayment of mortgage backed securities brought on by the low interest rate environment and the reallocation of million from our securities portfolio to bank owned life insurance
