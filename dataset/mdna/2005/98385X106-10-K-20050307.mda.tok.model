item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regarding recent price fluctuations and their effect on our results 
business strategy the primary components of our business strategy are acquiring long lived  operated oil and gas properties  including undeveloped leases  increasing production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and through development  exploitation and exploration activities  hedging a portion of our production to stabilize cash flow and protect the economic return on development projects and acquisitions  and retaining management and technical staff that have substantial experience in our core areas 
acquiring long lived  operated properties 
we seek to acquire long lived  operated producing properties that contain complex multiple producing horizons with the potential for increases in reserves and production  produce from non conventional sources  including tight natural gas reservoirs  coal bed methane and natural gas producing shale formations  are in core operating areas or in areas with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics  and present opportunities to reduce expenses per mcfe  and lower the rate of potential increases to expenses per mcfe  through more efficient operations 
we believe that the properties we acquire provide opportunities to increase production and reserves through the implementation of mechanical and operational improvements  workovers  behind pipe completions  secondary recovery operations  new development wells and other development activities 
we also seek to acquire facilities related to gathering  processing  marketing and transporting oil and gas in areas where we own reserves 
such facilities can enhance profitability  reduce costs  and provide marketing flexibility and access to additional markets 
the ability to successfully purchase properties is dependent upon  among other things  competition for such purchases and the availability of financing to supplement internally generated cash flow 
we also seek to acquire undeveloped properties that potentially have the same attributes as targeted producing properties 
increasing production and reserves 
a principal component of our strategy is to increase production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and low risk development 
we believe that our principal 
table of contents 
index to financial statements properties possess geologic and reservoir characteristics that make them well suited for production increases through drilling and other development programs 
we have generated an inventory of between  and  potential drilling locations 
additionally  we review operations and mechanical data on operated properties to determine if actions can be taken to reduce operating costs or increase production 
such actions include installing  repairing and upgrading lifting equipment  redesigning downhole equipment to improve production from different zones  modifying gathering and other surface facilities and conducting restimulations and recompletions 
we may also initiate  upgrade or revise existing secondary recovery operations 
exploration activities 
during  we plan to focus our exploration activities on projects that are near currently owned productive fields 
we believe that we can prudently and successfully add growth potential through exploratory activities given improved technology  our experienced technical staff and our expanded base of operations 
we have allocated approximately million of our million development budget for exploration activities 
hedging activities 
to reduce production price risk  we enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
our policy is to routinely hedge a portion of our production 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the full benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits provided by predictable  stable cash flow  including ability to more efficiently plan and execute our development program  which facilitates predictable production growth  ability to help assure the economic return on strategic acquisitions  ability to enter long term arrangements with drilling contractors  allowing us to continue development projects when product prices decline  more consistent returns on investment  and better utilization of our personnel 
experienced management and technical staff 
most senior management and technical staff have worked together for over years and have substantial experience in our core operating areas 
bob r 
simpson and steffen e 
palko  co founders of the company  were previously executive officers of southland royalty company  one of the largest us independent oil and gas producers prior to its acquisition by burlington northern  inc in other strategies 
we may also acquire working interests in nonoperated producing properties if such interests otherwise meet our acquisition criteria 
we attempt to acquire nonoperated interests in fields where the operators have a significant interest to protect  including potential undeveloped reserves that will be exploited by the operator 
we may also acquire nonoperated interests in order to ultimately accumulate sufficient ownership interests to operate the properties 
we also attempt to acquire a portion of our reserves as royalty interests 
royalty interests have few operational liabilities because they do not participate in operating activities and do not bear production or development costs 
royalty trusts and publicly traded partnerships 
we have created and sold units in publicly traded royalty trusts 
sales of royalty trust units allow us to more efficiently capitalize our mature  lower growth properties 
we may create and distribute or sell interests in additional royalty trusts or publicly traded partnerships in the future 
business goals 
in january  we announced a strategic goal for of increasing production by to over levels 
to achieve this growth target  we plan to drill about net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in we have budgeted million for our development program  which is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
we plan to spend million in the eastern region of east texas and northwestern louisiana  million in the barnett shale of north texas  million in the raton  san juan and uinta basins  million for programs in the permian basin  and million in the arkoma basin and mid continent region 
we expect to spend million for exploration 

table of contents 
index to financial statements while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during if acquisition  development and exploration expenditures exceed cash flow from operations  we expect to obtain additional funding through our bank credit facilities  issuance of public or private debt or equity  or asset sales 
strategic property acquisitions during may alter the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
our total budget for acquisitions  development and exploration will be adjusted throughout to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return 
we also may reevaluate our budget and drilling programs in the event of significant changes in oil and gas prices 
our ability to achieve production goals depends on the success of our planned drilling programs or property acquisitions made in place of a portion of the drilling program 
the weak us dollar  raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and cause prices to remain high 
in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and have negotiated supply contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting production growth and increasing development costs

proved reserves estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which  upon analysis of geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required 
estimated future net revenues also referred to herein as estimated future net cash flows 
computational result of applying current prices of oil and gas with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by existing contractual arrangements  other than hedge derivatives to estimated future production from proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves 
present value of estimated future net cash flows the computational result of discounting estimated future net revenues at a rate of annually 
the present value of estimated future net cash flows after income tax is also referred to herein as standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or standardized measure

none of our natural gas liquid proved reserves are attributable to gas plant ownership 
year end average realized prices used in the estimation of proved reserves were per mcf for gas  per bbl for natural gas liquids and per bbl for oil 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding estimated proved reserves 
in our prior reports  the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves and related present value amounts were reported before reduction for estimated operated overhead expense 
operated overhead is a component of production expense in the consolidated income statements and is an allocation from general and administrative expense of the costs estimated to support the production function 
as part of its periodic review of our filings  the staff of the securities and exchange commission concluded that production expense components for proved reserve disclosures should be consistent with components of production expense recorded in the financial statements 
accordingly  we have restated estimated future net cash flows and the related present value amounts for all years presented  resulting in a reduction to these amounts of approximately at december  and at december  estimated future net cash flows  and the related discounted present value  of year end proved reserves are significantly higher than at year end because of increased reserves related to acquisitions and development and higher oil and natural gas liquids prices used in the estimation of year end proved reserves 
year end product prices were per mcf for gas  per bbl for natural gas liquids and per bbl for oil 
uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as 
table of contents 
index to financial statements well as economic factors such as change in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates 
during  we filed estimates of oil and gas reserves as of december  with the us department of energy on form eia and form eia these estimates are consistent with the reserve data reported for the year ended december  in note to consolidated financial statements  with the exception that form eia includes only reserves from properties that we operate 
exploration and production data for the following data  gross refers to the total wells or acres in which we own a working interest and net refers to gross wells or acres multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by us

the company s production and reserves are adequate to meet this delivery commitment 
competition and markets we compete with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of our business  including acquisition of producing properties and oil and gas leases  marketing of oil and gas  and obtaining goods  services and labor 
some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources 
factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and our standards established for minimum 
table of contents 
index to financial statements projected return on investment 
gathering systems are the only practical method for the intermediate transportation of natural gas 
therefore  competition for natural gas delivery is presented by other pipelines and gathering systems 
competition is also presented by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil  imported liquified natural gas and other fossil fuels 
because of the long lived  high margin nature of our oil and gas reserves and management s experience and expertise in exploiting these reserves  management believes that it effectively competes in the market 
our ability to market oil and gas depends on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity of our gas production to pipelines  the available capacity in such pipelines  the demand for oil and gas  and the effects of weather and state and federal regulation 
we cannot assure that we will always be able to market all of our production at favorable prices 
we do not currently believe that the loss of any of our oil or gas purchasers would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had and could have in the future an adverse effect on our acquisition and development programs  proved reserves  revenues  profitability  cash flow and dividends

federal and state regulations there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect us 
we cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal energy bill after failing to pass legislation in and  congress is currently considering a new energy bill 
the potential effect of this legislation is unknown  but it may include certain tax incentives for oil and gas producers and changes in the federal regulatory framework 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and certain sales for resale of natural gas  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  is subject to federal regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january   and none of our gathering systems are currently subject to ferc regulation 
we cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from our properties and the direct access to end user markets  the future impact of these regulations on marketing our production or on our gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
we  however  do not believe that we will be affected differently than competing producers and marketers 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of our oil production is transported by pipeline 
under rules adopted by ferc effective january  interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
these rules have had little effect on our oil transportation cost 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas 
table of contents 
index to financial statements wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells that can be drilled

to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters

item legal proceedings on october   an action  styled united states of america ex rel 
grynberg v 
cross timbers oil company  et al  was filed in the us district court for the western district of oklahoma by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the us false claims act against the company and certain of our subsidiaries 
the plaintiff alleges that we underpaid royalties on natural gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans in amounts in excess of as a result of mismeasuring the volume of natural gas  incorrectly analyzing its heating content and improperly valuing the natural gas during at least the past ten years 
the plaintiff seeks treble damages for the unpaid royalties with interest  attorney fees and expenses  civil penalties between  and  for each violation of the us false claims act  and an order for us to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices 
this lawsuit against us and similar lawsuits filed by grynberg against more than other companies have been consolidated in the united states district court for wyoming 
in october  the court granted a motion to dismiss grynberg s royalty valuation claims  and grynberg s appeal of this decision was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction in may the parties have completed discovery regarding whether the plaintiff has met the jurisdictional prerequisites for maintaining an action under the us false claims act 
in june  we joined with other defendants in filing a motion to dismiss  contending that the plaintiff has not satisfied the jurisdictional requirements to maintain this action 
a hearing on this motion has been scheduled for march while we are unable to predict the outcome of this case  we believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and no provision has been accrued in our financial statements

gas pipelines  et al 
formerly quinque case 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against us and one of our subsidiaries  along with over natural gas transmission companies  producers  gatherers and processors of natural gas 
the plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas working interest owners  overriding royalty owners and royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or who received economic benefit from the sale of such gas since january  the allegations in the case are similar to those in the grynberg case  however  the price case broadens the claims to cover all oil and gas leases other than the federal and native american leases that are the subject of the grynberg case 
the complaint alleges that the defendants have mismeasured both the volume and heating content of natural gas delivered into their pipelines  resulting in underpayments to the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs assert a breach of contract claim  negligent or intentional misrepresentation  civil conspiracy  common carrier liability  conversion  violation of a variety of kansas statutes and other common law causes of action 
the amount of damages was not specified in the complaint 
in february  we  along with one of our subsidiaries  were dismissed from the suit and another subsidiary of the company was added 
a hearing was held in january  and the court held that a class should not be certified 
the plaintiffs counsel has filed an amended class action petition  which reduces the proposed class to only royalty owners  reduces the claims to mismeasurement of volume only  conspiracy  unjust enrichment and accounting  and only applies to gas measured in kansas  colorado and wyoming 
the court has set an evidentiary hearing in april to determine whether the amended class should be certified

gas pipelines  et al 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against natural gas pipeline owners and operators 
the plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or measured natural gas since january  to the present 
the new petition alleges the same improper analysis of gas heating content that had previously been alleged in the price case discussed above until it was removed from the case by the filing of the amended class action petition 
in all other respects  the new petition appears to be identical to the amended class action petition in that it has a proposed class of only royalty owners  alleges conspiracy  unjust enrichment and accounting  and only applies to gas measured in kansas  colorado and wyoming

v 
jm huber corp 
and xto energy inc the action was filed in the district court of la plata county  colorado against us and jm huber corporation 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants have deducted in their calculation of royalty payments expenses of compression  gathering  treatment  dehydration  or other costs to place the natural gas produced in a marketable condition at a marketable location 
the plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all lessors and their successors in interest who own or have owned mineral interests located in la plata county  colorado and that are leased to or operated by huber or us  except to the extent that the lessors or their successors have expressly authorized deduction of post production expenses from royalties 
we acquired the interests of huber in producing properties in la plata county effective october   and have assumed the responsibility for certain liabilities of huber prior to the effective date  which may include liability for post production deductions made by huber 
as of december   based on an evaluation of available information  we accrued a million estimated liability for this claim in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we agreed to a tentative settlement of approximately million  resulting in an additional loss of approximately million to be recorded in first quarter in december  the us environmental protection agency issued a compliance agreement and final order to us  which cited certain violations concerning the discharge of produced water and sanitary wastes into alaska s cook inlet from our two operated production platforms from january through june we reported these discharges to the epa as part of our offshore discharge permit monitoring

unless otherwise indicated  throughout this discussion the term mcfe refers to thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent quantities produced for the indicated period  with oil and natural gas liquid quantities converted to mcf on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six mcf 
overview our business is to produce and sell natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil from our predominantly southwestern and central us properties  most of which we operate 
because we consider our gathering  processing and marketing as ancillary functions to our production of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  we have determined that our business comprises only one industry segment 
in  we achieved the following record financial and operating results average daily gas production was  mcf  a increase from  average daily oil production was  bbls  a increase from  and average daily natural gas liquids production was  bbls  a increase from year end proved reserves were tcfe  a increase from year end net income was million  a increase from  and earnings per basic common share was  a increase from cash flow from operating activities was billion  a increase from stockholders equity was billion  a increase from year end the debt to capitalization ratio improved to at year end from at year end we achieve production and proved reserve growth primarily through producing property acquisitions  followed by low risk development generally funded by cash flow from operating activities 
funding sources for our acquisitions include proceeds from sales of public and private equity and debt  bank borrowings  cash flow from operating activities  or a combination of these sources 
maintaining or improving our debt to capitalization ratio is a primary consideration in selecting our method of acquisition financing 
during  we acquired billion of producing properties with proved reserves of bcf of natural gas  million bbls of natural gas liquids and million bbls of oil 
in january  we announced an agreement to acquire antero resources corporation  a prominent producer in the barnett shale of north texas  for cash and equity consideration of approximately million 
the agreement was amended in february to include antero s gas gathering assets and related bank debt of million 
our goal for is to increase production by to 
to achieve future production and reserve growth  we will continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our criteria  and to complete development projects included in our inventory of between  and  potential development drilling locations 
our development budget is million 
while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during we cannot ensure that we will be able to find properties that meet our acquisition criteria and that we can purchase such properties on acceptable terms 
the weak us dollar  raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and cause prices to remain high 
in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and have negotiated supply contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting production growth and increasing development costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements sales prices for our natural gas and oil production are influenced by supply and demand conditions over which we have little or no control  including weather and regional and global economic conditions 
to provide predictable production growth  we hedge a portion of our production at prices that ensure stable cash flow margins to fund our operating commitments and development program 
as of february  we have hedged approximately of our projected gas production at an average nymex price of per mcf and about of our crude oil production at an average nymex price of per bbl 
our average realized price on hedged production will be lower than these average nymex prices because of location  quality and other adjustments 
the combined effect of higher product prices  a increase in gas production and a increase in oil production resulted in a increase in total revenues to billion in from billion in on an mcfe produced basis  total revenues were in  a increase from in we analyze  on an mcfe produced basis  expenses that generally trend changes in production increase decrease production taxes  transportation and other depreciation  depletion and amortization accretion of discount in asset retirement obligation general and administrative  excluding stock based incentive compensation interest production expense rose primarily because of the increase in oil production  which is more expensive to produce than natural gas 
taxes  transportation and other expense generally is based on product revenues  and the increase in this expense per mcfe is primarily caused by increased product prices 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization resulted from higher acquisition and development costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense is because of increased personnel and other costs related to company growth 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production include stock based incentive compensation 
this is a component of general and administrative expense and primarily relates to the vesting of performance shares when the common stock price reaches specified target levels 
incentive compensation was million in  a increase from the comparable expense of million 
included in incentive compensation is million of cash compensation related to vesting of cash equivalent performance shares 
otherwise  stock based incentive compensation was non cash 
increased incentive compensation is because of the increase in the common stock price during and the resulting increased value of vested awards 
after adjusting for the effect of the may and april common stock offerings  stock based incentive compensation was approximately of the increase in market capitalization during each of and including stock based incentive compensation  general and administrative expense increased million  or 
derivative fair value gain loss 
this is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of underlying commodities 
derivative fair value losses of million in and million in were primarily related to the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives caused by the effect of increasing oil and gas prices on hedges in areas without basis or location differential contracts 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility with commercial banks and public and private offerings of equity and debt 
in january  standard poors upgraded our corporate credit rating to investment grade and all liens on producing properties and other collateral were 
table of contents 
index to financial statements irrevocably released as security for our revolving credit agreement with commercial banks 
as a result  moody s upgraded our existing senior notes to ba from ba and confirmed our ba senior implied rating 
in march  moody s upgraded our issuer rating and senior implied rating to baa in february  we fully repaid our revolving credit agreement and entered a new five year revolving credit agreement with commercial banks that matures in february the agreement currently provides for a maximum commitment amount of billion  and an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate plus 
on december   borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with commercial banks were million at a weighted average interest rate of  with unused borrowing capacity of million 
in november  we borrowed million under a five year bank term loan due april with an initial interest rate of libor plus 
other terms and conditions are substantially the same as our existing revolving credit agreement 
our consolidated financial position and results of operations are significantly affected by our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we utilize the successful efforts method of oil and gas accounting that requires expensing of unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as exploratory geological and geophysical costs 
all acquisition  development and successful exploratory well costs are generally capitalized and expensed through depreciation  depletion and amortization  which is computed on the unit of production method 
if conditions indicate our properties may be impaired  we estimate future net cash flows from the applicable properties and compare this estimate to our total net cost of the properties 
if the property cost cannot be recovered from the estimated future net cash flows  we must write down the property cost to the discounted present value of such future net cash flows 
to date  our impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision recorded in while we do not expect significant impairment provisions in the near future  any prolonged significant decline in commodity prices could require an impairment adjustment to our property cost 
the amounts we record for depreciation  depletion and amortization and impairment are dependent upon our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
our proved reserve estimates are subject to potentially significant revisions based on subsequent drilling results and production data  changes in prices and costs  as well as other factors 
significant events  transactions and conditions the following events  transactions and conditions affect the comparability of results of operations and financial condition for each of the years ended december   and and may impact future operations and financial condition 
acquisitions 
we acquired producing and undeveloped properties at a total cost of billion in  million in and million in  which were funded by a combination of proceeds from sales of common stock and senior notes  bank borrowings and cash flow from operating activities

the purchase agreement was amended in february to include antero s gas gathering assets and related bank debt of million 
the transaction is expected to close april  the booked acquisition cost will include customary non cash adjustments  including a step up for deferred taxes 
the cash consideration for the acquisition will be initially provided through cash flow from operations and existing bank credit facilities 
 and development and exploration programs 
gas development focused on the east texas area and the arkoma and san juan basins during  and oil development was concentrated in alaska and in the permian basin during all three years

while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to continue to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during if acquisition  development and exploration expenditures exceed cash flow from operations  we expect to obtain additional funding through our bank credit facilities  public or private issuance of debt or equity  or asset sales 
the cost of property acquisitions may alter the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
our total budget for acquisitions  development and exploration will be adjusted throughout to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as of december   we have an inventory of between  and  potential drilling locations 
we plan to drill about net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in drilling plans are dependent upon product prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  political and other conditions we generally cannot control or predict 
gas 
natural gas prices are dependent upon north american supply and demand  which is affected by weather and economic conditions 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as a fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
the winter of was one of the warmest on record  resulting in higher than average gas storage levels and lower gas prices in prices climbed in fourth quarter as a result of low levels of drilling activity  increased industrial demand  colder weather and international instability 
colder than normal weather  record low gas storage levels and continued increasing demand caused gas prices to remain relatively high during the first five months of with diminished demand related to higher prices  natural gas prices were lower during the summer months  then rose with cooler weather in the fall and early winter 
forecasts for continued production declines  increasing natural gas demand and larger than projected storage withdrawals supported higher prices in the first six months of mild summer weather and increased gas storage inventories led to declining gas prices in august and early september 
natural gas prices rose again in mid september because of reduced gas production as a result of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
gas prices remained relatively high for the remainder of because of sporadic colder weather and lower gas supplies 
with moderate temperatures and favorable supply  prices were lower in january  but rose in february as a result of colder weather in the us northeast and europe 
prices will continue to be affected by weather  the recovery of the domestic economy  increases in the level of north american production and import levels of liquified natural gas 
in any case  management expects natural gas prices to remain volatile 
as described under hedging activities below  we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to gas price fluctuations 
the following are comparative average gas prices for the last three years year ended december per mcf average nymex price average realized sales price average realized sales price excluding hedging at february   the average nymex gas price for the following months was per mmbtu 
as computed on an energy equivalent basis  our proved reserves were natural gas at december  after considering hedges in place as of february   we estimate that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow before income taxes 
oil 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
oil prices declined in because of lagging demand caused by a global recession 
rising uncertainties in the middle east led to higher prices late in during  unusually low storage levels  the war in iraq and production discipline by opec maintained oil prices at relatively high levels 
oil prices continued to increase in early because of increasing demand and low crude stocks 
despite increased production by opec members  oil prices exceeded per bbl in october because of continued instability in the middle east and nigeria and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
with mild winter weather and an ample supply of oil stocks  prices declined in late but rebounded in january and february following global supply outages  colder weather in the us northeast and europe and continued disruptions of iraqi exports 
as described under hedging activities below  we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
the following are comparative average oil prices for the last three years year ended december per bbl average nymex price average realized sales price average realized sales price excluding hedging 
table of contents 
index to financial statements at february   the average nymex oil price for the following months was per bbl 
after considering hedges in place as of february   we estimate that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow before income taxes 
hedging activities 
we enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts  to hedge our exposure to product price volatility 
our policy is to routinely hedge a portion of our production 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the full benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits of more predictable production growth and cash flows 
in  all hedging activities decreased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million  while in  all hedging activities decreased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million  and in  hedging activities increased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million 
the following summarizes our january through december nymex hedging positions at february   excluding basis adjustments which are separately hedged 
our average daily production was  mcf of gas and  bbls of oil in fourth quarter prices to be realized for hedged production will be less than these nymex prices because of location  quality and other adjustments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
futures contracts and swap agreements for january through december production natural gas crude oil mcf per day average nymex price per mcf bbl per day average nymex price per bbl derivative fair value gain loss 
we record in our income statements realized and unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting  as well as the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives 
we recorded an million loss is  a million loss in and a million gain in related to changes in fair value of these non hedge derivatives 
the loss includes a million loss on the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  or approximately of total hedge derivative losses  while the loss includes a million loss on the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  or approximately of total hedge derivative losses 
netted in the derivative fair value gain is a million loss on the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  or approximately of total hedge derivative losses 
these ineffective hedge derivative losses are primarily because of increasing oil and gas prices and their effect on hedges of production in areas without corresponding basis or location differential swap contracts 
unrealized derivative gains and losses associated with effective cash flow hedges are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at december   we have an unrealized pre tax loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of gas and crude oil price risk 
this fair value loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings through december the actual reclassification to earnings will be based on mark to market prices at contract settlement date

impairment provision 
we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions warrant 
this evaluation is based on an assessment of recoverability of net property costs from estimated future net cash flows from those properties 
estimated future net cash flows are based on management s best estimate of projected oil and gas reserves and prices 
we have not recorded impairment of producing properties since a million provision was recorded in if oil and gas prices significantly decline  we may be required to record impairment provisions for producing properties in the future  which could be material

index to financial statements primarily related to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
during  we also recognized a million gain on the distribution of cross timbers royalty trust units as a dividend to common stockholders 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings against the revolving credit facility  occasional producing property sales including sales of royalty trust units and private or public offerings of equity and debt 
other than for operations  our cash requirements are generally for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
we believe that our sources of liquidity are adequate to fund our cash requirements in cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in increased cash provided by operating activities from to and from to was primarily because of increased prices and production from acquisitions and development activity 
cash provided by operating activities was decreased by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in and million in and was increased by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily the result of timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
cash provided by operating activities was also reduced by exploration expense of million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities is largely dependent upon the prices received for oil and gas production 
as of february  we have hedged approximately of our projected gas production and about of our projected crude oil production 
see significant events  transactions and conditions product prices above 
we do not have any investments in unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of company growth related to acquisitions and development 
as of december  total capitalization was billion  of which was long term debt 
capitalization at december  was billion  of which was long term debt 
the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is primarily because of our earnings for the year 
working capital we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since our principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  we often have low or negative working capital 
working capital decreased from a negative position of million at december  to negative working capital of million at december  excluding the effects of current derivative and deferred tax assets and liabilities  working capital decreased million 
this decrease is because of increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to increased production and drilling liabilities  partially offset by increased accounts receivable related to increased revenues 
any cash settlement of hedge derivatives should generally be offset by increased or decreased cash flows from our sales of related production 
therefore  we believe that most of the changes in derivative fair value assets and liabilities are offset by changes in value of our oil and gas reserves 
this offsetting change in value of oil and gas reserves  however  is not recorded in the financial statements 
none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
when the monthly cash settlement amount under our hedge derivatives is calculated  if market prices are higher than the fixed contract prices  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while this payment will ultimately be funded by higher prices received from sale of our production  production receipts lag payments to the counterparties by as much as days 
any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 

table of contents 
index to financial statements most of our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
we currently have greater concentrations of credit with several a or better rated integrated energy companies 
financial and commodity based futures and swap contracts expose us to the credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to the contracts 
this exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions  and we have master netting agreements with counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts 
letters of credit or other appropriate forms of security are obtained as considered necessary to limit risk of loss 
financing in february  we entered a five year revolving credit agreement with commercial banks that matures in february the agreement currently provides for a maximum commitment amount of billion  and an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than

in november  we entered a new million five year term loan due april with an initial interest rate of libor plus 
other terms and conditions are substantially the same as our existing revolving credit agreement 
as of december   borrowings under the term loan were million 
in february  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to potentially offer securities which could include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants to purchase debt or stock

net proceeds from the sale of such securities will be used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of bank debt 
capital expenditures in  exploration and development cash expenditures totaled million compared with million in we have budgeted million for the development and exploration program 
as we have done historically  we expect to fund the development program with cash flow from operations 
since there are no material long term commitments associated with this budget  we have the flexibility to adjust our actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions and the effects of our acquisition and development programs 
the weak us dollar  raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and cause prices to remain high 
in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and have negotiated supply contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting production growth and increasing development costs 
while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during if acquisition  development and exploration expenditures exceed cash flow from operations  we expect to obtain additional funding through our bank credit facilities  issuance of public or private debt or equity  or asset sales 
there are no restrictions under our revolving credit agreement that would affect our ability to use our remaining borrowing capacity for acquisitions of producing properties 
to date  we have not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and we do not expect to do so during however  new regulations  enforcement policies  claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs 
dividends the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share each quarter of  per common share each quarter of  per common share for first and second quarter and per common share for the remainder of in february  the board increased the dividend rate by declaring

transportation contracts 
we have entered firm transportation contracts with various pipelines 
under these contracts we are obligated to transport minimum daily gas volumes or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate 
as calculated on a monthly basis  our failure to deliver these minimum volumes to the pipeline requires us to pay the pipeline for any deficiency 
our production committed to these pipelines is expected to exceed the minimum daily volumes provided in the contracts 
we have generally delivered at least minimum volumes under these firm transportation contracts  therefore avoiding payment for deficiencies 
purchase obligations 
we have agreed to acquire an airplane for million  either through purchase or lease  and have made an initial payment of million in we currently expect to take delivery of the airplane in the first half of this obligation is reflected as a purchase in the table above  net of the amount paid in derivative contracts 
we have entered into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
as of december   market prices generally exceeded the fixed prices specified by these contracts  resulting in a derivative fair value current liability of million and long term liability of million 
if market prices are higher than the contract prices when the cash settlement amount is calculated  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while such payments generally will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received as much as days after payment to counterparties and can result in draws on our revolving credit facility

otherwise  retirement benefits are only provided through our defined contribution k plan 
post retirement medical benefits are not prefunded but are paid when incurred

a portion of the producing properties obtained in the chevrontexaco acquisition were considered nonstrategic and marked for disposition at the time of purchase 
in august  we exchanged million of these properties for  net contiguous acres in our new core operating area  the barnett shale of north texas  and million in other consideration 
this exchange was with companies either wholly or majority owned by the adult children and a brother of bob r 
simpson  chairman and chief executive officer of the company 
in connection with this exchange  we granted these companies an option to purchase other properties included in the chevrontexaco acquisition 
on march   these companies purchased the properties for an adjusted purchase price of million 
lehman brothers inc provided a fairness opinion to the board of directors on the value of properties exchanged and sold 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are significantly affected by accounting policies and estimates related to our oil and gas properties  proved reserves  asset retirement obligation and commodity prices and risk management  as summarized below 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as all exploratory geological and geophysical costs  are expensed 
under the full cost method  all exploration costs are capitalized  regardless of success 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate that the properties may be impaired 
such conditions include a significant decline in product prices which we believe to be other than temporary or a significant downward revision in estimated proved reserves for a field or area 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management s estimates of future product prices and costs  based on available information such as forward strip prices and industry forecasts and analysis 
an impairment provision must be recorded to adjust the net book value of the property to its estimated fair value if the net book value exceeds the estimated future net cash flows from the property 
the estimated fair value of the property is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows 
the impairment assessment process is primarily dependent upon the estimate of proved reserves 
any overstatement of estimated proved reserve quantities would result in an overstatement of estimated future net cash flows  which could result in an understated assessment of impairment 
the subjectivity and risks associated with estimating proved reserves are discussed under oil and gas reserves below 
prediction of product prices is subjective since 
table of contents 
index to financial statements prices are largely dependent upon supply and demand resulting from global and national conditions generally beyond our control 
however  management s assessment of product prices for purposes of impairment is consistent with that used in its business plans and investment decisions 
while there is judgment involved in management s estimate of future product prices  the potential impact on impairment is not currently significant since current and projected product prices are substantially higher than our net acquisition and development costs per mcfe 
because of this  our historical impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision in  and we do not currently expect significant future impairment unless product prices were to decline and remain at levels substantially below current levels 
we believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impracticable to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof  including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
proved reserves  as defined by the financial accounting standards board and adopted by the securities and exchange commission  are limited to reservoir areas that indicate economic producibility through actual production or conclusive formation tests  and generally cannot extend beyond the immediately adjoining undrilled portion 
although improved technology often can identify possible or probable reserves other than by drilling  these reserves cannot be estimated and disclosed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
while total dd a expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing of when dd a expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of dd a expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of dd a expense recognition 
as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  net upward revisions occurred to proved reserves on an mcfe basis in and  resulting in a decrease of dd a expense of approximately  or million  in and  or million  in net downward revisions of proved reserves on an mcfe basis occurred in  resulting in an increase in dd a expense of approximately  or million 
based on proved reserves at december   we estimate that a change in proved reserves would increase or decrease dd a expense by approximately million 
during  development and exploration activities resulted in extensions  additions  discoveries and net revisions of proved reserves that were of our production 
over the last five years  our proved reserve extensions  additions  discoveries and net revisions averaged of our production for this period 
our proved reserve extensions  additions and discoveries in included an increase of bcfe in proved undeveloped reserves  or approximately of our total extensions  additions and discoveries  which are expected to be developed within three years 
over the past four years  approximately of our proved reserves extensions  additions and discoveries were proved undeveloped reserves which were generally reclassified to proved developed reserves within three years 
development of our proved undeveloped reserves is not subject to significant uncertainties such as regulatory approvals  and we believe that we have adequate resources to develop these reserves  dependent on commodity prices not declining significantly 
we believe that reserve additions  comparable to these historical reserve additions  are attainable in the near term future  subject to product prices and development costs remaining at levels to ensure economic viability 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in note to consolidated financial statements  are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 

table of contents 
index to financial statements asset retirement obligation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties including removal of our offshore platforms in alaska at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we increased our estimated asset retirement obligation by million  or approximately of the asset retirement obligation at december   based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
commodity prices and risk management commodity prices significantly affect our operating results  financial condition  cash flows and ability to borrow funds 
current market oil and gas prices are affected by supply and demand as well as seasonal  political and other conditions which we generally cannot control 
oil and gas prices and markets are expected to continue their historical volatility 
see significant events  transactions and conditions product prices above 
we attempt to reduce our price risk on a portion of our production by entering into financial instruments such as futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
while these instruments secure a certain price and  therefore  a certain cash flow  there is the risk that we may not be able to realize the full benefit of rising prices 
these contracts also expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by the contract counterparties  all of which are major investment grade financial institutions 
we attempt to limit our credit risk by obtaining letters of credit or other appropriate forms of security 
we also have sold call options as part of our hedging program 
call options  however  do not provide a hedge against declining prices  and there is the risk that the call sales proceeds will be less than the benefit a higher sales price would have provided 
while our price risk management activities decrease the volatility of cash flows  they may obscure our reported financial condition 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles  we record derivative financial instruments at their fair value  representing projected gains and losses to be realized upon settlement of these contracts in subsequent periods when related production occurs 
these gains and losses are generally offset by increases and decreases in the market value of our proved reserves  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
derivatives that provide effective cash flow hedges are designated as hedges  and  to the extent the hedge is determined to be effective  we defer related unrealized fair value gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs

see also commodity price risk under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for the effect of price changes on derivative fair value gains and losses 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which provides that all nonmonetary asset exchanges that have commercial substance must be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  and any resulting gain or loss recorded 
an exchange is defined as having commercial substance if it results in a significant change in expected 
table of contents 
index to financial statements future cash flows 
exchanges of operating interests by oil and gas producing companies to form a joint venture continue to be exempted 
apb opinion previously exempted all exchanges of similar productive assets from fair value accounting  therefore resulting in no gain or loss recorded for such exchanges 
we must implement sfas for any nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring on or after january  this change in accounting is currently not expected to have a significant effect on our reported financial position or earnings 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fas that concluded that the special tax deduction allowed under the american jobs creation act of should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction as provided by sfas accordingly  any tax relief the company receives under the new tax law will be recorded as a reduction of current tax when realized  rather than an immediate reduction to its accrued deferred income tax liability 
also in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that compensation related to all stock based awards  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements 
this pronouncement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and will be effective beginning july  we have previously recorded stock compensation pursuant to the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 whereby no compensation was recognized for most stock option awards 
we expect that stock option grants will continue to be a significant part of employee compensation  and  therefore  sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
for the pro forma effect of recording compensation for all stock awards at fair value  utilizing the black scholes method  see stock based compensation in note to consolidated financial statements 
we are currently considering alternative valuation methods to determine stock award fair value for grants after june  we plan to use the modified prospective application method of adopting sfas no 
r  whereby the estimated fair value of unvested stock awards granted prior to july  will be recognized as compensation expense in periods subsequent to june   based on the estimated service period 
the fair value of awards granted prior to july  will be the same value as determined under the black scholes method for our pro forma disclosure 
as of february   all stock options outstanding at that date vested when the common stock price closed above the target price level of  resulting in no compensation expense to be recognized after june  related to these awards 
in february  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sent a letter to oil and gas registrants regarding situations that require additional financial statement disclosures  pending final resolution of accounting treatment 
the following are items related to registrants using the successful efforts method of accounting companies may enter concurrent commodity buy sale arrangements  or transactions in contemplation of other transactions  often to assure that the commodity is available at a specific location 
pending resolution of accounting questions with the emerging issues task force  the commission staff has requested additional disclosures for any such material arrangements  including separate disclosure on the face of the income statement of any related proceeds and costs reported on a gross basis 
these disclosures are not applicable to us since we have not entered any significant transactions of this nature 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  specifies that drilling costs for completed exploratory wells should be expensed if the related reserves cannot be classified as proved within one year unless certain criteria are met 
rather than specifying this one year requirement  a proposed fasb staff position has been issued that provides guidance for evaluating whether sufficient progress is being made to determine whether reserves can be classified as proved 
pending approval of the fasb staff position  the commission staff has requested additional disclosures be included in registrants financial statements regarding their accounting policy for capitalization of exploratory drilling costs  as well as disclosure of capitalized exploratory drilling cost amounts included in the financial statements 
as disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements  we generally pursue development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities  and our drill well costs are generally transferred to producing properties within one month of the well completion date 
disclosure of changes in capitalized exploratory well costs is included in note to consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements production imbalances we have gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well  or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
we use the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred for gas deliveries in excess of our net revenue interest  while revenue is accrued for the undelivered volumes 
production imbalances are generally recorded at the estimated sales price in effect at the time of production 
the consolidated balance sheets include the following amounts related to production imbalances december in thousands amount mcf amount mcf accounts receivable current underproduction accounts payable current overproduction net current gas underproduction balancing receivable other assets noncurrent underproduction other long term liabilities noncurrent overproduction net long term gas overproduction balancing payable other assets noncurrent carbon dioxide underproduction net long term overproduction balancing payable forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  contain projections and forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to our operations and the oil and gas industry

these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed below 
oil and gas price fluctuations 
our results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
we routinely hedge a portion of our production to reduce the effects of price volatility see hedging arrangements below 
otherwise  the prices we receive depend upon factors beyond our control  including political instability in oil producing regions  weather conditions  ability of opec to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  consumer demand  worldwide economic conditions and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of oil and gas 
to the extent we have not hedged our production  any decline in oil and gas prices adversely affects our financial 
table of contents 
index to financial statements condition 
if the oil and gas industry experiences significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations  make planned capital expenditures or reach production growth targets 
debt level 
we have substantial debt and may incur more 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing production from existing reserves or developing new reserves  we may lack the funds to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations 
our indebtedness also affects our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and may preclude pursuit of other business opportunities 
capital requirements 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  production  exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and public or private offerings of equity and debt 
lower oil and gas prices  however  may reduce cash flow available to pay down bank borrowings or other debt 
competitive industry 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major oil companies  independent oil and gas businesses  and individual producers and operators 
in addition  there is competition from alternative energy sources  such as heating oil  imported liquified natural gas and other fossil fuels 
some of our competitors have financial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours 
these companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
we also compete with these companies for technical  managerial and other professional personnel 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties  and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
reserve replacement 
our success depends upon finding  acquiring and developing oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we are able to successfully explore for  develop or acquire proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline through depletion and our financial assets and annual revenues will decline unless prices substantially increase 
we cannot assure the success of our exploration  development and acquisition activities 
hedging arrangements 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas  we currently and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our oil and gas production 
these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreements and actual prices received 
in addition  these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and gas 
reserve estimates 
estimating our proved reserves involves many uncertainties  including factors beyond our control 
petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows 
lower oil and gas prices generally cause lower estimates of proved reserves 
ultimately  actual production  revenues and expenditures relating to our reserves will vary from any estimates  and these variations may be material 
acquiring producing properties 
we constantly evaluate opportunities to acquire oil and gas properties and frequently engage in bidding and negotiation for these acquisitions 
if successful in this process  we may alter or increase our capitalization through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  the sale of production payments or other measures 
any change in capitalization affects our risk profile 
acquisitions may also alter the nature of our business 
this could occur when the character of acquired properties is substantially different from our existing properties in terms of operating or geologic characteristics 
drilling activities 
our drilling activities subject us to many risks  including the risk that we will not find commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil and gas can be unprofitable  not only from dry wells  but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
also  title problems  weather conditions  governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services can delay our drilling operations or result in their cancellation 
shortages of equipment  including pipe  can lead to a delay or suspension of drilling and can significantly increase the cost of drilling 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and we cannot assure that new wells will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements marketability of production 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities could harm our business 
we deliver some of our oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may not be available to us in the future or access may be limited for extended periods due to maintenance or other curtailment 
growth through acquisitions 
our business strategy has emphasized growth through strategic acquisitions  but we may not be able to continue to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our strategy of completing acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy may be hindered if we are not able to obtain financing or regulatory approvals 
our ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
governmental regulations 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the oil and gas industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our oil and natural gas exploration  development and production  and our storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons  are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and natural gas wells and other related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection  reports concerning operations  and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  reclamation costs  remediation and clean up costs  and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
further  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could make it more expensive for us to conduct our business or cause us to limit or curtail some of our operations 
we currently own  lease or expect to acquire  and have in the past owned or leased  numerous properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for many years 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes were taken for disposal 
in addition  petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed or released by prior operators of properties that we are acquiring as well as by current third party operators of properties in which we have an ownership interest 
properties impacted by any such disposal or releases could be subject to costly and stringent investigatory or remedial requirements under environmental laws  some of which impose strict joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
these laws include the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  the federal resource conservation and recovery act and analogous state laws 
under these laws and any implementing regulations  we could be required to remediate contaminated properties and take actions to compensate for damages to natural resources 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury or property damages allegedly caused by the release of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment 
we currently do not expect any remedial obligations imposed under environmental laws to have a significant effect on our operations 
our operations in the coastal waters of cook inlet of alaska are subject to the federal oil pollution act  which imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in united states waters 
the oil pollution act imposes strict joint and several liability on responsible parties for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages  including natural resource damages 
liability limits for offshore facilities require a responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages 
these liability limits do not apply  however  if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party  if the spill 
table of contents 
index to financial statements resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operation regulation  or if the party failed to report the spill or cooperate fully in any resulting cleanup 
the oil pollution act also requires a responsible party at an offshore facility to submit proof of its financial ability to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with oil pollution act requirements 
the department of transportation  through the office of pipeline safety and research and special programs administration  has implemented a series of rules requiring operators of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines to develop integrity management plans for pipelines that  in the event of a failure  could impact certain high consequence areas 
these rules also require operators to conduct baseline integrity assessments of all applicable pipeline segments located in the high consequence areas 
we are currently in the process of identifying all of our pipeline segments that may be subject to these rules and are developing integrity management plans for all covered pipeline segments 
we do not expect to incur significant costs in achieving compliance with these rules 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
our operations are subject to inherent hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fire  natural disasters  explosions  blowouts  formations with abnormal pressures  failure of oilfield drilling and service tools  uncontrollable flows of underground gas  oil and formation water  pipeline ruptures or cement failures and environmental hazards such as gas leaks and oil spills 
any of these events could cause a loss of hydrocarbons  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of operations  personal injury claims  loss of life  damage to our properties  or damage to the property of others 
in addition  our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease or by acquired companies prior to the date we acquire them 
as protection against operating hazards  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost 
we believe that our insurance is adequate and customary for companies of similar size and operation  but losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts exceeding existing coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only enter derivative financial instruments in conjunction with our hedging activities 
these instruments principally include commodity futures  collars  swaps and option agreements and interest rate swap agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of fluctuations in interest rates and natural gas and crude oil prices 
gains and losses on these derivatives are generally offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
our board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by us relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
the policy also requires review and approval by the chairman  the executive vice president administration and the senior vice president marketing of all risk management programs using derivatives and all derivative transactions 
these programs are also reviewed at least quarterly by our internal risk management committee and annually by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates and product prices 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   our variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated its fair value  and our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of billion and an approximate fair value of billion 
we attempt to balance the benefit of lower cost variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with more expensive fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate senior and subordinated debt  as well as the occasional use of interest rate swaps 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
unless otherwise noted  the hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether interest rates increase or decrease 
in thousands carrying amount fair value a hypothetical change in fair value december  long term debt december  long term debt a fair value is based upon current market quotes and is the estimated amount required to purchase our long term debt on the open market 
this estimated value does not include any redemption premium 
commodity price risk we hedge a portion of our price risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas sales 
as of december   we had outstanding gas futures contracts  swap agreements and gas basis swap agreements 
these contracts and agreements had a net fair value loss of approximately million at december  and a net fair value loss of million at december  of the december  fair value  a million loss has been determined based on the exchange trade value of nymex contracts  and a million gain has been determined based on the broker bid and ask quotes for basis contracts 
these fair values approximate amounts confirmed by the counterparties 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of gas futures contracts and swap agreements at december  as of december   outstanding oil futures contracts and differential swaps had a net fair value loss of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in oil prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these oil futures and differential swaps at december  none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
because most of our futures contracts and swap agreements have been designated as hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value generally are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the related sale of production occurs 
at that time  the realized hedge derivative gain or loss is transferred to product revenues in the consolidated income statement 
we had a physical delivery contract to sell  mcf per day from through july at a price of approximately of the average nymex futures price for intermediate crude oil 
because this gas sales contract was priced based on crude oil  which is not clearly and closely associated with natural gas prices  it was accounted for as a non hedge derivative financial instrument 
this contract referred to as the enron btu swap contract was terminated in december in conjunction with the bankruptcy filing of enron corporation 
in november  we entered derivative contracts to effectively defer until and any cash flow impact related to  mcf of daily gas deliveries in that were to be made under the enron btu swap contract 
the net fair value loss on these contracts at december  was million 
the effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these contracts  while a change in crude oil prices would result in a change of approximately million 
since the contracts are not hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value are recognized in our consolidated income statement as a derivative fair value gain or loss
