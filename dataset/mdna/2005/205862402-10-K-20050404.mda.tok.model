 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf requiring contingently convertible debt to be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive as if the notes were converted into common shares at the time of issuance the if converted method regardless of whether market price triggers or other contingent features have been met

under eitf  the company is not required to include any shares issuable upon conversion of the new zyps issued in the exchange offer in its diluted shares outstanding unless the market price of the company s common stock exceeds the conversion price  and would then only have to include that number of shares as would then be issuable based upon the in the money value of the conversion rights under the new zyps 
therefore  the new zyps are dilutive in calculating diluted earnings per share if the company s common stock is trading above to the extent of the number of shares the company would be required to issue to satisfy a conversion right of the new zyps over and above  for the year ended january   this resulted in approximately  of additional share dilution in calculating diluted earnings per share 
the existing zyps are immediately dilutive in calculating diluted earnings per share to the extent of the full number of shares underlying the existing zyps  which as of january  is  shares 
these shares are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share  whether or not the existing zyps may be converted pursuant to their terms  and therefore decreases the company s diluted earnings per share

the ability of cti s israeli subsidiaries to pay dividends is governed by israeli law  which provides that dividends may be paid by an israeli corporation only out of its earnings as defined in accordance with the israeli companies law of  provided that there is no reasonable concern that such payment will cause such subsidiary to fail to meet its current and expected liabilities as they come due 
in the event of a devaluation of the israeli currency against the dollar  the amount in dollars available for payment of cash dividends out of prior years earnings will decrease accordingly 
cash dividends paid by an israeli corporation to united states resident corporate parents are subject to the convention for the avoidance of double taxation between israel and the united states 
under the terms of the convention  such dividends are subject to taxation by both israel and the united states and  in the case of israel  such dividends out of income derived in respect of a period for which an israeli company is entitled to the reduced tax rate applicable to an approved enterprise are generally subject to withholding of israeli income tax at source at a rate of 
the israeli company is also subject to additional israeli taxes in respect of such dividends  generally equal to the tax benefits previously granted in respect of the underlying income by virtue of the approved enterprise status 
the company s liquidity and capital resources have not been  and are currently not anticipated to be  materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the ability of its foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or by withholding taxes associated with any such dividend payments 
the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business and anticipates that it may from time to time issue additional debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities could be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated investment 
the company believes that its existing working capital  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide for its planned operations for the foreseeable future  on both a consolidated and individual business segment basis 
certain trends and uncertainties the company derives the majority of its revenue from the telecommunications industry  which has experienced a challenging capital spending environment 
although the capital spending environment has improved recently and the company s revenues have increased in recent quarters  the company has experienced significant revenue declines from historical peak revenue levels  and if capital spending and technology purchasing by telecommunications service providers tsp does not continue to improve or declines  revenue may stagnate or decrease  and the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
although the company currently has good near term visibility  for these reasons and the risk factors outlined below  it has been and continues to be very difficult for the company to accurately forecast future revenues and operating results 
the company s business is particularly dependent on the strength of the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry  including the company  have been negatively affected by  among other factors  the high costs and large debt positions incurred by some tsps to expand capacity and enable the provision of future services and the corresponding risks associated with the development  marketing and adoption of these services as discussed below  including the cost of acquisitions of licenses to provide broadband services and reductions in tsps actual and projected revenues and deterioration in their actual and projected operating results 
accordingly  tsps  including the company s customers  have significantly reduced their actual and planned expenditures to expand or replace equipment and delayed and reduced the deployment of services 
a number of tsps  including certain customers of the company  also have indicated the existence of conditions of excess capacity in certain markets 
certain tsps also have delayed the planned introduction of new services  such as broadband mobile telephone services  that would be supported by certain of the company s products 
certain of the company s customers also have implemented changes in procurement practices and procedures  including limitations on purchases in anticipation of estimated future capacity requirements  and in the management and use of their networks  that have reduced the company s sales  which also has made it very difficult for the company to project future sales 
the continuation and or exacerbation of these negative trends will have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
recently  there have been announcements of several mergers in the telecommunications industry 
to the extent that the company s customer base consolidates  the company may have an increased dependence on a smaller number of customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on the company s prices and contractual terms in general 
consolidation also may result in the loss of both existing and potential customers of the company 
the company has experienced declines in revenue from some of its traditional products sold to tsps compared with prior years 
the company is executing a strategy to capitalize on growth opportunities in new and emerging products to offset such declines 
while certain of these new products have met with initial success  it is unclear whether they will be widely adopted by the company s customers and tsps in general 
increases in revenue from these new products also may not exceed declines the company may experience in revenue from the sale of its traditional products 
if revenue from sales of its traditional products declines faster than revenue from new products increases  the company s revenue and operating results will be adversely affected 
in addition to loss of revenue  weakness in the telecommunications industry has affected and will continue to affect the company s business by increasing the risks of credit or business failures of suppliers  customers or distributors  by customer requirements for vendor financing and longer payment terms  by delays and defaults in customer or distributor payments  and by price reductions instituted by competitors to retain or acquire market share 
the company s current plan of operations is predicated  in part  on a recovery in capital expenditures by its customers 
in the absence of such improvement  the company would experience deterioration in its operating results  and may determine to modify its plan for future operations accordingly  which may include  among other things  reductions in its workforce 
the company intends to continue to make significant investments in its business  and to examine opportunities for growth 
these activities may involve significant expenditures and obligations that cannot readily be curtailed or reduced if anticipated demand for the associated products does not materialize or is delayed 
the impact of these decisions on future financial results cannot be predicted with assurance  and the company s commitment to growth may increase its vulnerability to downturns in its markets  technology changes and shifts in competitive conditions 
the company examines opportunities for growth through merger and acquisitions 
if the company does make acquisitions  it may not discover all potential risks and liabilities of the newly acquired business through the due diligence process  will inherit the acquired companies past financial statements with their associated risks and may enter an industry in which it has limited or no experience 
also  the company may not be able to successfully incorporate the personnel  operations and customers of these companies into the company s business 
in addition  the company may fail to achieve the anticipated synergies from the combined businesses  including marketing  product integration  distribution  product development and other synergies 
the integration process may further strain the company s existing financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures 
this may result in the diversion of management and financial resources from the company s core business objectives 
in addition  an acquisition or merger may require the company to utilize cash reserves  incur debt or issue equity securities  which may result in a dilution of existing stockholders  and the company may be negatively impacted by the assumption of liabilities of the merged or acquired company 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  the company may find the value of its acquired technologies and related intangible assets  such as goodwill as recorded in the company s financial statements  to be impaired  resulting in charges to operations 
the company may also fail to retain the acquired or merged companies key employees and customers 
the company also may not be able to identify future suitable merger or acquisition candidates  and even if the company does identify suitable candidates  it may not be able to make these transactions on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
the company has made  and in the future  may continue to make strategic investments in other companies 
these investments have been made in  and future investments will likely be made in  immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies 
such investments have a high degree of risk  with the possibility that the company may lose the total amount of its investments 
the company may not be able to identify suitable investment candidates  and  even if it does  the company may not be able to make those investments on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  even if the company makes investments  it may not gain strategic benefits from those investments 
currently  the company accounts for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations  which provide that any compensation expense relative to employee stock options be measured based on intrinsic value of the stock options 
as a result  when options are priced at or above fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  as currently is the company s practice  the company incurs no compensation expense 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for reporting periods beginning after june   which for the company is august  the effective date 
beginning on the effective date  the company must i expense all options granted after the effective date over the applicable vesting period  and ii expense the non vested portions of existing option grants going forward over their remaining vesting period 
compensation expense for the non vested portions of existing option grants as of the effective date will be recorded based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
under sfas no 
r  the company is required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock and stock options awards  this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense 
any such expense  although it would not affect the company s cash flows  will have a material negative impact on the company s future reported results of operations beginning on the effective date 
the company currently anticipates such expense may be up to million per quarter for each of the quarters ending october  and january  in may  the company issued  aggregate principal amount of zero yield puttable securities zyps the existing zyps 
on january   the company completed an offer to the holders of the outstanding existing zyps to exchange the existing zyps for new zyps the new zyps 
of the  worth of existing zyps outstanding prior to the exchange offer  approximately  aggregate principal amount representing approximately of the original issue of existing zyps were validly tendered in exchange for an equal principal amount of new zyps 
both the existing zyps and the new zyps have a conversion price of per share 
the ability of the holders to convert either the existing zyps or new zyps into common stock is subject to certain conditions including i during any fiscal quarter  if the closing price per share for a period of at least twenty days in the thirty consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is more than of the conversion price per share in effect on that thirtieth day  ii on or before may   if during the five business day period following any ten consecutive trading day period in which the daily average trading price for the existing zyps or new zyps for that ten trading day period was less than of the average conversion value for the existing zyps or new zyps during that period  iii during any period  if following the date on which the credit rating assigned to the existing zyps or new zyps by standard poor s rating services is lower than b or upon the withdrawal or suspension of the existing zyps or new zyps rating at the company s request  iv if the company calls the existing zyps or new zyps for redemption  or v upon other specified corporate transactions 
both the existing zyps and the new zyps mature on may  in addition  the company has the right to redeem the existing zyps for cash at any time on or after may   at their principal amount 
the holders have a series of put options  pursuant to which they may require the company to repurchase  at par  all or a portion of the existing zyps on each of may of   and and upon the occurrence of certain events 
the existing zyps holders may require the company to repurchase the existing zyps at par in the event that the common stock ceases to be publicly traded and  in certain instances  upon a change in control of the company 
the company cannot ensure  however  that sufficient funds will be available at the time of payment required on the existing zyps or that the company will be able to arrange financing to make any such required cash payments 
the new zyps have substantially similar terms as the existing zyps  except that the new zyps i have a net share settlement feature  ii allow the company to redeem some or all of the new zyps at any time on or after may  rather than may  as provided for in the existing zyps and iii allow the holders of the new zyps to require the company to repurchase their new zyps for cash on each of may    and the company cannot ensure  however  that sufficient funds will be available at the time of payment required on the new zyps or that the company will be able to arrange financing to make any such required cash payments 
the net share settlement feature of the new zyps provides that  upon conversion  the company would pay to the holder cash equal to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount of the new zyps being converted  which is currently  and would issue to the holder the remainder of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount  if any  in shares of the company s common stock the new conversion method 
the offer followed the september  conclusion by the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board s fasb on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf requiring contingently convertible debt to be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive as if the notes were converted into common shares at the time of issuance the if converted method regardless of whether market price triggers or other contingent features have been met 
eitf was effective for reporting periods ending after december  because these recent accounting changes would have required the company to include the shares of common stock underlying the existing zyps in its diluted earnings per share computations  pursuant to the exchange offer  the company offered to the existing zyps holders  new zyps convertible under the new conversion method 
under eitf  the company is not required to include any shares issuable upon conversion of the new zyps issued in the exchange offer in its diluted shares outstanding unless the market price of the company s common stock exceeds the conversion price  and would then only have to include that number of shares as would then be issuable based upon the in the money value of the conversion rights under the new zyps 
therefore  the new zyps are dilutive in calculating diluted earnings per share if the company s common stock is trading above to the extent of the number of shares the company would be required to issue to satisfy a conversion right of the new zyps over and above  for the year ended january  this resulted in approximately  of additional share dilution in calculating diluted earnings per share 
the existing zyps are immediately dilutive in calculating diluted earnings per share to the extent of the full number of shares underlying the existing zyps  which as of january  is  shares 
these shares are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share  whether or not the existing zyps may be converted pursuant to their terms  and therefore decreases the company s diluted earnings per share 
the adoption of eitf did not have an effect on reported diluted earnings loss per share for any periods presented 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the closing price per share on at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on january  was more than of the conversion price per share for both the existing zyps and new zyps 
as such  a conversion privilege for both the existing zyps and the new zyps was triggered and both the existing zyps and new zyps were convertible into cash and or the company s common stock at the option of the holders for the first fiscal quarter of the company s products involve sophisticated hardware and software technology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards 
if the company s current or future products develop operational problems  the company may incur fees and penalties in connection with such problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company offers complex products that may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the company may not discover such defects or errors until after a product has been released and used by the customer 
significant costs may be incurred to correct undetected defects or errors in the company s products and these defects or errors could result in future lost sales 
defects or errors in the company s products also may result in product liability claims  which could cause adverse publicity and impair their market acceptance 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological change 
the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications market  including the delay in the adoption of such new technologies  and new alternatives for the delivery of services are having  and can be expected to continue to have  a profound effect on competitive conditions in the market and the success of market participants  including the company 
in addition  some of the company s products  such as call answering  have experienced declines in usage resulting from  among other factors  the introduction of new technologies and the adoption and increased use of existing technologies  which may include enhanced areas of coverage for mobile telephones and caller id type services 
the company s continued success will depend on its ability to correctly anticipate technological trends in its industries  to react quickly and effectively to such trends and to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
as a result  the life cycle of the company s products is difficult to estimate 
the company s new product offerings may not enter the market in a timely manner for their acceptance 
new product offerings may not properly integrate into existing platforms and the failure of these offerings to be accepted by the market could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company s sales and operating results may be adversely affected in the event customers delay purchases of existing products as they await the company s new product offerings 
changing industry and market conditions may dictate strategic decisions to restructure some business units and discontinue others 
discontinuing a business unit or product line may result in the company recording accrued liabilities for special charges  such as costs associated with a reduction in workforce 
these strategic decisions could result in changes to determinations regarding a product s useful life and the recoverability of the carrying basis of certain assets 
the company has made and continues to make significant investments in the areas of sales and marketing  and research and development 
the company s research and development activities  which may be delayed and behind schedule  include ongoing significant investment in the development of additional features and functionality for its existing and new product offerings 
the success of these initiatives will be dependent upon  among other things  the emergence of a market for these types of products and their acceptance by existing and new customers 
the company s business may be adversely affected by its failure to correctly anticipate the emergence of a market demand for certain products or services  and changes in the evolution of market opportunities 
if a sufficient market does not emerge for new or enhanced product offerings developed by the company  if the company is late in introducing new product offerings  or if the company is not successful in marketing such products  the company s continued growth could be adversely affected and its investment in those products may be lost 
the company relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for specific components and may not be able to find alternate manufacturers that meet its requirements 
existing or alternative sources may not be available on favorable terms and conditions 
thus  if there is a shortage of supply for these components  the company may experience an interruption in its product supply 
in addition  loss of third party software licensing could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the telecommunications industry continues to undergo significant change as a result of deregulation and privatization worldwide  reducing restrictions on competition in the industry 
the worldwide enhanced services industry is already highly competitive and the company expects competition to intensify 
the company believes that existing competitors will continue to present substantial competition  and that other companies  many with considerably greater financial  marketing and sales resources than the company  may enter the enhanced services markets 
moreover  as the company enters into new markets as a result of its own research and development efforts or acquisitions  it is likely to encounter new competitors 
the company s competitors may be able to develop more quickly or adapt faster to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
some of the company s competitors have  in relation to it  longer operating histories  larger customer bases  longer standing relationships with customers  greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service  public relations  distribution and other resources 
new competitors continue to emerge and there continues to be consolidation among existing competitors  which may reduce the company s market share 
in addition  some of the company s customers may in the future decide to develop internally their own solutions instead of purchasing them from the company 
increased competition could force the company to lower its prices or take other actions to differentiate its products 
the company s recent growth has strained its managerial and operational resources 
the company s continued growth may further strain its resources  which could hurt its business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s managers will be able to manage growth effectively 
to manage future growth  the company s management must continue to improve the company s operational and financial systems  procedures and controls and expand  train  retain and manage its employee base 
if the company s systems  procedures and controls are inadequate to support its operations  the company s expansion could slow or come to a halt  and it could lose its opportunity to gain significant market share 
any inability to manage growth effectively could materially harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
because the company s common stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market  the company is subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board  which monitors the accounting practices of public companies 
many of these regulations have only recently been enacted  and continue to evolve  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
in addition  the company s efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  section of sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations require the company to include a management assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting and auditor attestation of that assessment in its annual report for the company s fiscal year ending january  while the company is able to assert  in the management certifications filed with this annual report on form k  that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of january  and that no material weaknesses have been identified  the company must continue to monitor and assess the internal control over financial reporting 
the company cannot provide any assurances that material weaknesses will not be discovered in the future 
if  in the future  the company s management identifies one or more material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting that remain unremediated  the company will be unable to assert such internal control over financial reporting is effective 
if the company is unable to assert that the internal control over financial reporting is effective for any given reporting period or if the company s auditors are unable to attest that the management s report is fairly stated or are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls  the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
the effort regarding section has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices  new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or new interpretations of existing accounting principles could have a significant adverse effect on the company s results of operations and may affect the company s reported financial results 
the market for verint s digital security and business intelligence products in the past has been affected by weakness in general economic conditions  delays or reductions in customers information technology spending and uncertainties relating to government expenditure programs 
verint s business generated from government contracts may be materially and adversely affected if i verint s reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired  ii verint is suspended or otherwise prohibited from contracting with a domestic or foreign government or any significant law enforcement agency  iii levels of government expenditures and authorizations for law enforcement and security related programs decrease  remain constant or shift to programs in areas where verint does not provide products and services  iv verint is prevented from entering into new government contracts or extending existing government contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations  including those related to procurement  v verint is not granted security clearances required to sell products to domestic or foreign governments or such security clearances are revoked  vi there is a change in government procurement procedures or vii there is a change in political climate that adversely affects verint s existing or prospective relationships 
competitive conditions in this sector also have been affected by the increasing use by certain potential customers of their own internal development resources rather than outside vendors to provide certain technical solutions 
in addition  verint s markets include an increasing number of competitors  including companies that are significantly larger and have more resources than verint 
in addition  a number of established government contractors  particularly developers and integrators of technology products  have taken steps to redirect their marketing strategies and product plans in reaction to cut backs in their traditional areas of focus  resulting in an increase in the number of competitors and the range of products offered in response to particular requests for proposals 
the market for actionable intelligence solutions  such as verint s security and business intelligence products is still emerging 
verint s growth is dependent on  among other things  the size and pace at which the markets for its products develop 
if the markets for its products decrease  remain constant or grow slower than verint anticipates  verint will not be able to maintain its growth 
continued growth in the demand for verint s products is uncertain as  among other reasons  its existing customers and potential customers may i not achieve a return on their investment in its products  ii experience technical difficulty in utilizing its products  or iii use alternative solutions to achieve their security  intelligence or business objectives 
in addition  as verint s business intelligence products are sold primarily to contact centers  slower than anticipated growth or a contraction in the number of contact centers will have a material adverse effect on verint s ability to maintain its growth 
the global market for analytical solutions for security and business applications is intensely competitive  both in the number and breadth of competing companies and products and the manner in which products are sold 
for example  verint often competes for customer contracts through a competitive bidding process that subjects it to risks associated with i the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns  and ii the substantial time and effort  including design  development and marketing activities  required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to verint 
a subsidiary of verint  verint technology inc verint technology  which markets  sells and supports its communications interception solutions to various us government agencies  is required by the national industrial security program to maintain facility security clearances and to be insulated from foreign ownership  control or influence 
the company  verint  verint technology and the department of defense entered into a proxy agreement  under which verint  among other requirements  appointed three us citizens holding the requisite security clearances to exercise all prerogatives of ownership of verint technology including  without limitation  oversight of verint technology s security arrangements as holders of proxies to vote verint technology stock 
the proxy agreement may be terminated and verint technology s facility security clearances may be revoked in the event of a breach of the proxy agreement  or if it is determined by the department of defense that termination is in the national interest 
if verint technology s facility security clearance is revoked  sales to us government agencies will be adversely affected and may adversely affect sales to other international government agencies 
in addition  concerns about the security of verint  its personnel or its products may have a material adverse affect on verint s business  financial condition and results of operations  including a negative impact on sales to us and international government agencies 
many of verint s government contracts contain provisions that give the governments party to those contracts rights and remedies not typically found in private commercial contracts  including provisions enabling the governments to i terminate or cancel existing contracts for convenience  ii in the case of the us government  suspend verint from doing business with a foreign government or prevent verint from selling its products in certain countries  iii audit and object to verint s contract related costs and expenses  including allocated indirect costs  and iv change specific terms and conditions in verint s contracts  including changes that would reduce the value of its contracts 
in addition  many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that deem government contracts in those jurisdictions to include these types of provisions  even if the contract itself does not contain them 
if a government terminates a contract with verint for convenience  verint may not recover its incurred or committed costs  and expenses or profit on work completed prior to the termination 
if a government terminates a contract for default  verint may not recover those amounts  and  in addition  it may be liable for any costs incurred by a government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
further  an agency within a government may share information regarding verint s termination with other government agencies 
as a result  verint s on going or prospective relationships with such other government agencies could be impaired 
verint must comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how verint does business with government agencies in various countries and may impose added costs on its business 
for example  in the united states  verint is subject to the federal acquisition regulations  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts  and to the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations 
verint is subject to similar regulations in foreign countries as well 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  verint may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies  which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a government may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations that could be costly to satisfy or that could impair verint s ability to obtain new contracts 
verint s products are often used by customers to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information and data  including information or data used in intelligence gathering or law enforcement activities 
verint may come into contact with such information or data when it performs support or maintenance functions for its customers 
while verint has internal policies  procedures and training for employees in connection with performing these functions  even the perception that such potential contact may pose a security risk or that any of verint s employees has improperly handled sensitive or confidential information and data of a customer could harm its reputation and could inhibit market acceptance of its products 
as the communications industry continues to evolve  governments may increasingly regulate products that monitor and record voice  video and data transmissions over public communications networks  such as the solutions that verint offers 
for example  products which verint sells in the united states to law enforcement agencies and which interface with a variety of wireline  wireless and internet protocol networks  must comply with the technical standards established by the federal communications commission pursuant to the communications assistance for law enforcement act and products that it sells in europe must comply with the technical standards established by the european telecommunications standard institute 
the adoption of new laws governing the use of verint s products or changes made to existing laws could cause a decline in the use of its products and could result in increased expenses for verint  particularly if it is required to modify or redesign its products to accommodate these new or changing laws 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its sales and operating profit from contracts for large system installations with major customers 
the company continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its product development and marketing strategies 
contracts for large installations typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  and the ability of the company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict 
the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast  and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction 
the company s future operating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the operating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted different strategies  and also may be more volatile than the company has experienced in prior periods 
the degree of dependence by the company on large system orders  and the investment required to enable the company to perform such orders  without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders  increase the risk associated with its business 
because a significant proportion of the company s sales of these large system installations occur in the late stages of a quarter  a delay  cancellation or other factor resulting in the postponement or cancellation of such sales may cause the company to miss its financial projections  which may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
the company s gross margins also may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  obsolescence charges  price competition and changes in distribution channels or in the mix of products sold 
during the period between the evaluation and purchase of a system  customers may defer or scale down proposed orders of the company s products for  among other reasons i changes in budgets and purchasing priorities  ii reduced need to upgrade existing systems  iii deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  iv introduction of products by the company s competitors  and v lower prices offered by the company s competitors 
geopolitical  economic and military conditions could directly affect the company s operations 
the outbreak of diseases  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  have curtailed and may in the future curtail travel to and from certain countries 
restrictions on travel to and from these and other regions on account of additional incidents of diseases  such as sars  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause disruptions to the company s business 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of the company s products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
more recently  the us military involvement in overseas operations including  for example  the war in iraq and other armed conflicts throughout the world  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company is a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of its systems in the event of a catastrophic event  such as a major earthquake  tsunami or other natural disaster  cyber attack or terrorist attack could cause delays in completing sales and providing services 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the company s critical business systems could severely affect its ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  the financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
hackers and others have in the past created a number of computer viruses or otherwise initiated denial of service attacks on computer networks and systems 
the company s information technology infrastructure is regularly subject to various attacks and intrusion efforts of differing seriousness and sophistication 
if such hackers are successful  confidential information  including passwords  financial information  or other personal information may be improperly obtained and the company may be subject to lawsuits and other liability 
even if the company is not held liable  a security breach could harm the company s reputation  and even the perception of security risks  whether or not valid  could inhibit market acceptance of the company s products and could harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
while the company diligently maintains its information technology infrastructure and continuously implements protections against such viruses  electronic break ins  disruptions or intrusions  if the defensive measures fail or should similar defensive measures by the company s customers fail  the company s business could be materially and adversely affected 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  which in the past and may in the future  lead to security and economic problems for israel 
current and future conflicts and political  economic and or military conditions in israel and the middle east region can directly affect the company s operations in israel 
from october  until recently  terrorist violence in israel increased significantly  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip  and israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders 
there can be no assurance that the recent relative calm and renewed discussions with palestinian representatives will continue 
the company could be materially adversely affected by hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
in addition  the sale of products manufactured in israel may be materially adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws  policies or practices directed toward israel or companies having operations in israel 
the continuation or exacerbation of violence in israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts involving israel may impede the company s ability to sell its products or otherwise adversely affect the company 
in addition  many of the company s israeli employees in israel are required to perform annual compulsory military service in israel and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
the absence of these employees may have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
the company s costs of operations have at times been affected by changes in the cost of its operations in israel  resulting from changes in the value of the israeli shekel relative to the united states dollar 
recently  the weakening of the dollar relative to the shekel has increased the costs of the company s israeli operations  stated in united states dollars 
the company s operations have at times also been affected by difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified scientific  engineering and technical personnel in israel  where the availability of such personnel has at times been severely limited 
changes in these factors have from time to time been significant and difficult to predict  and could in the future have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s historical operating results reflect substantial benefits received from programs sponsored by the israeli government for the support of research and development  as well as tax moratoriums and favorable tax rates associated with investments in approved projects approved enterprises in israel 
some of these programs and tax benefits have ceased and others may not be continued in the future 
the availability of such benefits to the company may be negatively affected by a number of factors  including budgetary constraints resulting from adverse economic conditions  government policies and the company s ability to satisfy eligibility criteria 
the israeli government has reduced the benefits available under some of these programs in recent years  and israeli government authorities have indicated that the government may further reduce or eliminate some of these benefits in the future 
the company has regularly participated in a conditional grant program administered by the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade of the state of israel ocs under which it has received significant benefits through reimbursement of up to of qualified research and development expenditures 
certain of the company s subsidiaries currently pay royalties  of between and or under certain circumstances of associated product revenues including service and other related revenues to the government of israel in consideration of benefits received under this program 
such royalty payments are currently required to be made until the government has been reimbursed the amounts received by the company  which is linked to the us dollar  plus  for amounts received under projects approved by the ocs after january   interest on such amount at a rate equal to the month libor rate in effect on january of the year in which approval is obtained 
as of january   such subsidiaries of the company received approximately million in cumulative grants from the ocs and recorded approximately million in cumulative royalties to the ocs 
during the year ended january   one of the company s subsidiaries finalized an arrangement with the ocs whereby the subsidiary agreed to pay a lump sum royalty amount for all past amounts received from the ocs 
in addition  this subsidiary began to receive lower amounts from the ocs than it had historically received  but will not have to pay royalty amounts on such grants 
the amount of reimbursement received by the company under this program has been reduced significantly  and the company does not expect to receive significant reimbursement under this program in the future 
in addition  permission from the government of israel is required for the company to manufacture outside of israel products resulting from research and development activities funded under these programs 
in order to obtain such permission  the company will be required to increase the royalties to the applicable funding agencies and or repay certain amounts received as reimbursement of research and development costs 
the transfer outside of israel of any intellectual property rights resulting from research and development activities funded under ocs programs is not permitted 
the continued reduction in the benefits received by the company under the program  or the termination of its eligibility to receive these benefits at all in the future  could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s overall effective tax rate benefits from the tax moratorium provided by the government of israel for approved enterprises undertaken in that country 
the company s effective tax rate may increase in the future due to  among other factors  the increased proportion of its taxable income associated with activities in higher tax jurisdictions  the full utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and by the relative ages of the company s eligible investments in israel 
the tax moratorium on income from the company s approved enterprise investments made prior to is four years  whereas subsequent approved enterprise projects are eligible for a moratorium of only two years 
reduced tax rates apply in each case for certain periods thereafter 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  the company must continue to meet conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets and financing a percentage of investments with share capital 
if the company fails to meet such conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled and the company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
israeli authorities have indicated that additional limitations on the tax benefits associated with approved enterprise projects may be imposed for certain categories of taxpayers  which would include the company 
if further changes in the law or government policies regarding those programs were to result in their termination or adverse modification  or if the company were to become unable to participate in  or take advantage of  those programs  the cost of the company s operations in israel would increase and there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the ability of the company s israeli subsidiaries to pay dividends is governed by israeli law  which provides that dividends may be paid by an israeli corporation only out of its earnings as defined in accordance with the israeli companies law of  provided that there is no reasonable concern that such payment will cause such subsidiary to fail to meet its current and expected liabilities as they come due 
in the event of a devaluation of the israeli currency against the dollar  the amount in dollars available for payment of cash dividends out of prior years earnings will decrease accordingly 
cash dividends paid by an israeli corporation to united states resident corporate parents are subject to the convention for the avoidance of double taxation between israel and the united states 
under the terms of the convention  such dividends are subject to taxation by both israel and the united states and  in the case of israel  such dividends out of income derived in respect of a period for which an israeli company is entitled to the reduced tax rate applicable to an approved enterprise are generally subject to withholding of israeli income tax at source at a rate of 
the israeli company is also subject to additional israeli taxes in respect of such dividends  generally equal to the tax benefits previously granted in respect of the underlying income by virtue of the approved enterprise status 
the company s success is dependent on recruiting and retaining key management and highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel 
the market for highly skilled personnel remains very competitive 
the company s ability to attract and retain employees also may be affected by cost control actions  which in the past and may again in the future  include reductions in the company s workforce and the associated reorganization of operations 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its total sales from customers outside of the united states 
international transactions involve particular risks  including political decisions affecting tariffs and trade conditions  rapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual countries  turbulence in foreign currency and credit markets  and increased costs resulting from lack of proximity to the customer 
the company is required to obtain export licenses and other authorizations from applicable governmental authorities for certain countries within which it conducts business 
the failure to receive any required license or authorization would hinder the company s ability to sell its products and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  legal uncertainties regarding liability  compliance with local laws and regulations  local taxes  labor laws  employee benefits  currency restrictions  difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer collection periods and other requirements may have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
also  the company s foreign subsidiaries hold a significant amount of cash 
the repatriation of such cash to the united states is subject to withholding tax  which would reduce the total amount of cash the company would receive if such cash is repatriated into the united states 
volatility in international currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the company has  and anticipates that it will continue to receive  contracts denominated in foreign currencies  particularly the euro 
as a result of the unpredictable timing of purchase orders and the payments under such contracts and other factors  it is often not practicable for the company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates during the contract period 
although recently the company has significantly increased the amount of its foreign currency exposure that it has hedged  the company may experience adverse consequences from not hedging all of its exchange rate risks associated with contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s operating results have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of currency fluctuations 
operating results may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that the company does undertake 
while the company generally requires employees  independent contractors and consultants to execute non competition and confidentiality agreements  the company s intellectual property or proprietary rights could be infringed or misappropriated  which could result in expensive and protracted litigation 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law to protect its technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use its products or technology 
effectively policing the unauthorized use of the company s products is time consuming and costly  and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will prevent misappropriation of its technology  particularly in foreign countries where in many instances the local laws or legal systems do not offer the same level of protection as in the united states 
if others claim that the company s products infringe their intellectual property rights  the company may be forced to seek expensive licenses  reengineer its products  engage in expensive and time consuming litigation or stop marketing its products 
the company attempts to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in its product development efforts 
the company does not  however  regularly conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in its products infringes patents held by third parties 
there are many issued patents as well as patent applications in the fields in which the company is engaged 
because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until published or issued  applications may have been filed which relate to the company s software and products 
if the company were to discover that its products violated or potentially violated third party proprietary rights  it might not be able to continue offering these products without obtaining licenses for those products or without substantial reengineering of the products 
any reengineering effort may not be successful and the company cannot be certain as to whether such licenses would be available 
even if such licenses were available  the company cannot be certain that any licenses would be offered to the company on commercially reasonable terms 
while the company occasionally files patent applications  it cannot be assured that patents will be issued on the basis of such applications or that  if such patents are issued  they will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology 
in addition  the company cannot be assured that any patents issued to it will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in technology related industries  and the company expects that its products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in its industry segments grows and the functionality of software products in different industry segments overlaps 
in addition  the company has agreed to indemnify certain customers in certain situations should it be determined that its products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties 
any third party infringement claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product and service delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against the company and its failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company holds a large proportion of its net assets in cash equivalents and short term investments  including a variety of public and private debt and equity instruments  and has made significant venture capital investments  both directly and through private investment funds 
such investments subject the company to the risks inherent in the capital markets generally  and to the performance of other businesses over which it has no direct control 
given the relatively high proportion of the company s liquid assets relative to its overall size  the results of its operations are materially affected by the results of the company s capital management and investment activities and the risks associated with those activities 
declines in the public equity markets have caused  and may be expected to continue to cause  the company to experience realized and unrealized investment losses 
the severe decline in the public trading prices of equity securities in the past  particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors  and corresponding decline in values of privately held companies and venture capital funds in which the company has invested  have  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
in addition  although interest rates have risen recently  low interest rates have in the past and may in the future have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company issues stock options as a key component of its overall compensation 
there is growing pressure on public companies from shareholders generally and various organizations to reduce the rate at which companies  including the company  issue stock options to employees  which may make it more difficult to obtain stockholder approval of equity compensation plans when required 
in addition  fasb has adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles gaap that will require the company to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for its employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans beginning in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  cti and certain of its subsidiaries have terminated their employee stock purchase plans 
in addition  the company believes expensing stock options will increase shareholder pressure to limit future option grants and could make it more difficult for the company to grant stock options to employees in the future 
as a result  the company may lose top employees to non public  start up companies or may generally find it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the trading price of the company s shares has been affected by the factors disclosed herein as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
share prices of companies in technology related industries  such as the company  tend to exhibit a high degree of volatility  which at times is unrelated to the operating performance of a company 
the announcement of financial results that fall short of the results anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant negative effect on the trading price of the company s shares in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond the company s immediate control  can be unpredictable and  since a significant proportion of the company s sales during each fiscal quarter tend to occur in the latter stages of the quarter  may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
these factors may contribute to the volatility of the trading value of its shares regardless of the company s long term prospects 
the trading price of the company s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in the telecommunications equipment industry in general  and the company s business segments in particular  which may not have any direct relationship with the company s business or prospects 
the company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and currently does not expect to pay cash dividends in the near future 
consequently  any economic return to a shareholder may be derived  if at all  from appreciation in the price of the company s stock  and not as a result of dividend payments 
the company may issue additional equity securities  which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock 
the company has used and may continue to use its common stock or securities convertible into common stock to acquire technology  products  product rights and businesses  or reduce or retire existing indebtedness  among other purposes 
the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities for these or other purposes would result in dilution of existing shareholders equity interests in the company 
in addition  the company s board of directors has the authority to cause the company to issue  without vote or action of the company s shareholders  up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  and has the ability to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of any such series 
any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock 
the company s board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred series  but reserves the right to do so in the future 
the company is also authorized to issue  without shareholder approval  common stock under certain circumstances 
the issuance of either preferred or common stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire  or could discourage a person from seeking to acquire  control of the company 
if this occurs  investors could lose the opportunity to receive a premium on the sale of their shares in a change of control transaction

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity trading prices  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company operates internationally and is therefore exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary currencies that the company is exposed to are the euro and the israeli shekel 
the company may  from time to time  use foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflows and outflows resulting from the sale of its products in foreign currency  primarily the euro  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
as of january   the company had approximately million of notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to sell euros with a fair value of approximately  with an original maturity of up to six months 
neither a increase nor decrease from current exchange rates would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
various financial instruments held by the company are sensitive to changes in interest rates
