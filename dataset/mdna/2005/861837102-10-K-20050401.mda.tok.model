item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion also contains statements that are forward looking 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this annual report and in our other sec filings 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
overview we are a non asset based third party logistics services company providing supply chain solutions on a global basis 
we offer a full range of time definite transportation and distribution solutions through our domestic services platform where we manage and arrange the movement of raw materials  supplies  components and finished goods for our customers 
these services are offered through our domestic air and ground freight forwarding business 
we offer a full range of international logistics services including international air and ocean transportation as well as customs house brokerage services through our international services platform 
in addition to these core service offerings  we also provide a broad range of value added supply chain management services  including warehousing  order fulfillment and inventory control solutions 
we serve a customer base of manufacturers  distributors and national retail chains through a network of offices in major metropolitan areas in north america  one in puerto rico  locations in asia and locations in brazil  using an extensive network of independent carriers and service partners strategically located around the world 
as a non asset based provider of third party logistics services  we seek to limit our investment in equipment  facilities and working capital through contracts and preferred provider arrangements with various transportation providers who generally provide us with favorable rates  minimum service levels  capacity assurances and priority handling status 
the dollar volume of our purchased transportation services enables us to negotiate attractive pricing with our transportation providers 
although our strategic objective is to build a leading global logistics services organization that integrates established operating businesses and innovative technologies  we identified a need to restructure certain of our businesses commencing in the fourth quarter of this restructuring involves the integration of duplicate facilities  abandonment of a major facility  rationalization of personnel and systems and certain other actions 
we expect to complete the restructuring by the end of the second quarter of further limiting our acquisition strategy is the seventh amendment to our credit facility with lasalle business credit  llc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
this amendment includes  among other covenants  a prohibition on further acquisitions and conditions to the payment of contractually obligated earn out payments 
notwithstanding these conditions in our credit facility and our immediate term focus on restructuring certain of the businesses within the united states  we remain committed to our acquisition strategy 
we plan to achieve this objective by broadening our network through a combination of synergistic acquisitions assuming we are allowed to continue our acquisition strategy under a replacement credit facility and the organic expansion of our existing base of operations 
once resumed  the focus of this strategy will be on acquiring businesses that have demonstrated historic levels of profitability  have a proven record of delivering high quality services  have a customer base of large and mid sized companies and which otherwise may benefit from our long term growth strategy and status as a public company 
our acquisition strategy relies upon two primary factors first  our ability to identify and acquire target businesses that fit within our general acquisition criteria and  second  the continued availability of capital and financing resources sufficient to complete these acquisitions and fund earn out payments for previous acquisitions 
our growth strategy relies upon a number of factors  including our ability to efficiently integrate the businesses of the companies we acquire  generate the anticipated synergies from their integration  and maintain the historic sales growth of the acquired businesses so as to generate continued organic growth 
the business risks associated with these factors are discussed in item of this report under the heading risks particular to our business 
our principal source of income is derived from freight forwarding services 
as a freight forwarder  we arrange for the shipment of our customers freight from point of origin to point of destination 
generally  we quote our customers a turnkey cost for the movement of their freight 
our price quote will often depend upon the customer s time definite needs same day or later as scheduled  special handling needs heavy equipment  delicate items  environmentally sensitive goods  electronic components  etc 
and the means of transport truck  air  ocean or rail 
in turn  we assume the responsibility for arranging and paying for the underlying means of transportation 
we also provide a range of other services including customs brokerage  warehousing and other value added logistics services which include customized distribution and inventory control services  fulfillment services and other value added supply chain services 
gross revenue represents the total dollar value of services we sell to our customers 
our cost of transportation includes direct costs of transportation  including motor carrier  air  ocean and rail services 
we act principally as the service provider to add value in the execution and procurement of these services to our customers 
our net transportation revenue gross transportation revenue less the direct cost of transportation is the primary indicator of our ability to source  consolidate  add value and resell services provided by third parties  and is considered by management to be a key performance measure 
management believes that net revenue is also an important measure of economic performance 
net revenue includes transportation revenue and our fee based activities  after giving effect to the cost of purchased transportation 
in addition  management believes measuring operating costs as a function of net revenue provides a useful metric as our ability to control costs as a function of net revenue directly impacts operating earnings 
with respect to our services other than freight transportation  net revenue is identical to gross revenue as the principal costs for these services are payroll and facility costs 
our operating results will be affected as acquisitions occur 
since all acquisitions are made using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  our consolidated financial statements will only include the results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
starting in the second half of  we began a program to establish an offshore network of owned offices with an initial focus in asia 
to help facilitate the consolidation  analysis and public reporting process  our offshore operations are included within our consolidated results on a one month lag  or more specifically  our calendar year results will include results from offshore operations for the period december though november our gaap based net income will also be affected by non cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets arising from our completed acquisitions 
under applicable accounting standards  purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration in a business combination to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the time of acquisition 
the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is to be allocated to goodwill  which is tested at least annually for impairment 
applicable accounting standards require the company to separately account for and value certain identifiable intangible assets based on the unique facts and circumstances of each acquisition 
as a result of the company s acquisition strategy  our net income loss will include material non cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions 
although these charges may increase as the company completes more acquisitions  we believe we are actually growing the value of our intangible assets eg  customer relationships 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations  and the growth of those operations is an important part of our business strategy 
our current international operations are focused on the shipment of goods into and out of the united states and are dependent on the volume of international trade with the united states 
our strategic plan contemplates the growth of those operations  as well as the expansion into the transportation of goods wholly outside of the united states 
a list of the factors that could adversely affect our current international operations has been included in item of this annual report on form k  under the heading risks particular to our business 
our operating results are also subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
our first and second quarters are likely to be weaker as compared with our other fiscal quarters  which we believe is consistent with the operating results of other supply chain service providers 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand and economic conditions 
since our revenue is largely derived from customers whose shipments are dependent upon consumer demand and just in time production schedules  the timing of our revenue is often beyond our control 
factors such as shifting demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays could unexpectedly affect the timing of our revenue 
as we increase the scale of our operations  seasonal trends in one area may be offset to an extent by opposite trends in another area 
we cannot accurately predict the timing of these factors  nor can we accurately estimate the impact of any particular factor  and thus we can give no assurance that historical seasonal patterns will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by us and are based upon our current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  costs of purchased transportation  accounting for stock options  the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  specifically goodwill and acquired intangibles  the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives for tangible and intangible assets and the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets 
the company derives its revenue from three principal sources freight forwarding  customs brokerage  and warehousing and other value added services 
as a freight forwarder  the company is primarily a non asset based carrier that does not own or lease any significant transportation assets 
the company generates the majority of its revenue by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and using those services to provide to its customers transportation of property for compensation 
the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power  while at the same time offering lower sell rates than most customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 
when acting as an indirect carrier  the company will enter into a written agreement with its customers or issue a tariff and a house bill of lading to customers as the contract of carriage 
when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier  the company receives a separate contract of carriage  or master bill of lading 
in order to claim for any loss associated with the freight  the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges 
based on the terms in the contract of carriage  revenue related to shipments where the company issues a house bill of lading is recognized when the freight is delivered to the direct carrier at origin 
costs related to the shipment are also recognized at this same time 
most transportation costs are estimated at the time of shipment and such estimates are updated for differences between estimated and actual amounts at the time invoices are processed for payment 
our revised processes for domestic purchased transportation costs also require the assessment of the adequacy of the recorded estimates 
all other revenue  including revenue for customs brokerage and warehousing and other value added services  is recognized upon completion of the service 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized for options issued at an exercise price equal to or greater than the quoted market price on the date of grant to employees  officers and directors 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and volatility 
if the fair value method were used  both basic and diluted loss per share would have increased by in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the goodwill arising from our acquisitions is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
in addition  the acquired intangibles arising from those transactions are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used including our identifiable intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in developing our future cash flow estimates  we incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates  including  among other things  that i existing operations are evaluated on a stand alone basis and  as such  achieve no revenue or cost synergies  ii no further acquisitions are made  iii formerly acquired companies achieve their earnings targets and their earn outs are fully paid  iv future earnings are fully taxed and v no additional equity is raised 
we cannot guarantee that our assets will not be impaired in future periods 
acquired intangibles consist of customer related intangibles and non compete agreements arising from the company s acquisitions 
customer related intangibles are amortized using accelerated methods over five to seven years and non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over periods of three to five years 
we maintain reserves for specific and general allowances against accounts receivable 
the specific reserves are established on a case by case basis by management 
a general reserve is established for all other accounts receivable  based on a specified percentage of the accounts receivable balance 
we continually assess the adequacy of the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts  based on our knowledge about the customer base 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our discontinued operations  which focused on the development of early stage technology businesses  and our continuing operations have generated significant net operating loss carryforwards nols which could have value in the future 
after giving effect for certain annual limitations based on changes in ownership as defined in section of the internal revenue code  we estimate that approximately million in nols may be available to offset future federal taxable income 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we are required to provide a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   the valuation allowance was million 
given our historical losses and our limited track record to date  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  we had deferred tax liabilities of approximately million at december  and approximately million at december   primarily related to the tax amortization of goodwill  which is deductible for tax purposes over a life of years but is not amortized for book purposes 
we do not anticipate paying federal income taxes in the near future as we expect that our existing nols will be sufficient to offset current taxable income  if any 
however  additional sales of our securities could have the effect of significantly limiting our ability to utilize our existing nols in the future 
discontinued operations prior to the first quarter of  our principal business was developing early stage technology businesses with significant internet features and applications 
largely as a result of the significant correction in the global stock markets which began during  and the corresponding decrease in the valuation of technology businesses and contraction in the availability of venture financing during  we elected to shift our business strategy to focus on the acquisition of operating businesses within a particular industry segment 
following a wind down of the technology business during the second quarter of  we focused our acquisition efforts specifically within the transportation and logistics industry 
this decision occurred in conjunction with our june  appointment of dennis l 
pelino as our chairman and chief executive officer 
mr 
pelino brings to us over years of logistics experience  including most recently  as president and chief operating officer of fritz companies  inc  where he was employed from to to reflect the change in business model  our consolidated financial statements have been presented in a manner in which the assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows related to our former business have been segregated from that of our continuing operations and are presented as discontinued operations

c during the earn out period  there is an additional contingent obligation related to tier two earn outs that could be as much as million if certain of the acquired companies generate an incremental million in pre tax earnings 
financial outlook we believe that gross revenues will be approximately million in due to a number of factors  including the financial performance of our domestic services operations  the company s intent to restructure its operations to realize synergies as part of the company s overall acquisition strategy and future efforts to realize efficiencies from a newly developed operating system  we are not able to provide guidance at this time about expected future performance beyond gross revenues 
our restructuring initiative includes the rationalization of facilities and personnel within the us some of these initiatives have been defined but much remains to be defined and implemented 
this initiative resulted in a material charge which negatively impacted the company s financial results in the fourth quarter of we will provide guidance in the future  but only after our plan is fully implemented and the newly streamlined operations have been functioning for a reasonable period of time 
this moratorium on financial performance guidance will be in effect for and perhaps beyond 
all previously issued financial guidance did not reflect the impact of the decreased financial performance of the domestic services platform or restructuring discussed above  nor was management aware of these issues at the time that the previously issued guidance was provided 
for these reasons  previously issued guidance relative to operating results for has been withdrawn 
sources of growth management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company s internally generated growth 
this same store analysis isolates the revenue contributions from operations that have been included in the company s operating results for the full comparable prior year period 
the table below presents same store comparisons for the year ended december  which is the measure of any increase from the same period of 
for the year ended december  domestic international total liquidity and capital resources as we approach the next stage of our development  we need to augment our capital structure by replacing our us facility and by obtaining additional capital from other sources 
this may take the form of subordinated debt  convertible preferred stock and or common stock  among others 
such an enhanced capital structure would permit continued expansion  but at a far slower pace than it has in the past 
there is no assurance that we will be able to replace our us facility  that additional capital will be available  or if available  at terms acceptable to us 
the seasonal trend of the business together with earnout payments presents significant liquidity challenges for the company at the end of the first quarter of each year 
these challenges have been magnified by the acceleration of million in lease payments in connection with a cross default provision in the lease documents 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

based on restated financial results for the year ended december   we have determined that amounts were paid in excess of amounts due by approximately million 
we have fully reserved these receivables because of differing interpretations  by the company and the selling shareholders  of the earn out provisions of the purchase agreements 
we will attempt to recover the excess amounts paid from the former owners of the acquired businesses 
any amounts we recover will result in the recognition of non operating income in the period recovered 
on july  we completed a private exchange transaction that eliminated approximately million  the series c preferred stock 
the terms of the series c preferred stock would have significantly constrained our future growth opportunities

on march   the company and the selling shareholder entered into a financial arrangement whereby the amount due became subject to a note payable due march  with interest at per annum 
based upon performance  the shareholder of shaanxi will be entitled to receive million on april  we may be required to make significant payments in the future if the earn out installments under our various acquisitions become due 
while we believe that a significant portion of the required payments will be generated by the acquired subsidiaries  we may have to secure additional sources of capital to fund some portion of the earn out payments as they become due 
this presents us with certain business risks relative to the availability and pricing of future fund raising  as well as the potential dilution to our stockholders if the fund raising involves the sale of equity 
the following table summarizes our maximum possible contingent base earn out payments for the years indicated based on results of the prior year as if pre tax earnings targets associated with each acquisition were achieved although the company does not expect the domestic services pre tax earnings levels to be fully achieved in thousands total earn out payments domestic     international      total earn out payments      prior year pre tax earnings targets domestic     international      total pre tax earnings targets      domestic international combined excludes the impact of prior year s pre tax earnings carryforwards excess or shortfalls versus earnings targets 
during the earn out period  there is an additional contingent obligation related to tier two earn outs that could be as much as million if certain of the acquired companies generate an incremental million in pre tax earnings 
aggregate pre tax earnings targets as presented here identify the uniquely defined earnings targets of each acquisition and should not be interpreted to be the consolidated pre tax earnings of the company which would give effect for  among other things  amortization or impairment of intangible assets created in connection with each acquisition or various other expenses which may not be charged to the operating groups for purposes of calculating earn outs 
the company is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings 
although we believe that the claims asserted in these proceedings are without merit  and we intend to vigorously defend these matters  there is the possibility that the company could incur material expenses in the defense and resolution of these matters 
furthermore  since the company has not established any reserves in connection with such claims  such liability  if any  would be recorded as an expense in the period incurred or estimated 
this amount  even if not material to the company s overall financial condition  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows in the period recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is not significant  although  as our international operations expand  that exposure could increase 
our exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on our interest incurred and our cash flows 
we place our cash with high credit quality financial institutions and invest that cash in money market funds and investment grade securities with maturities of less than days 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by investing in only highly rated investments and by limiting our exposure in any one issuance 
our credit facility bears interest at a variable rate 
if market interest rates had changed by basis points  interest expense and our cash flows would have changed by approximately  and  respectively 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments
