overview digitas inc is a relationship marketing services provider offering strategic and marketing services that drive measurable acquisition  cross sell  loyalty  affinity and customer care engines across digital and direct media for world leading marketers 
we derive substantially all of our fee revenues from the performance of professional services 
we recognize revenue earned under time and materials contracts as services are provided based upon hours worked and agreed upon hourly rates 
we recognize revenue earned under fixed price contracts  such as consulting arrangements  using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimates of total expected project costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date 
some contracts contain provisions for performance incentives 
that contingent revenue is recognized in the period in which the contingency is resolved 
on october   we acquired modem media  inc  a norwalk  connecticut based company that provides interactive marketing strategy services in a stock for stock transaction 
on the date of the acquisition  modem media had approximately employees and maintained offices in london  san francisco and norwalk 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
each outstanding share of modem media common stock was exchanged for shares of digitas inc s common stock  and each outstanding option to purchase modem media common stock was assumed by digitas inc and is exercisable into our common stock at the same exchange ratio 
the results of modem media since october  are included in our consolidated financial statements 
fee revenues increased by million or in to million from million in this growth resulted from increased demand for our services as our clients continued to shift expenditures towards direct advertising channels such as the internet 
in addition  the acquisition of modem media on october   contributed approximately percentage points of the overall percentage points of growth 
the increase in fee revenues combined with continued control of our cost structure resulted in net income of million  or per share  on a diluted basis 
included in our net income is a restructuring expense of million  or per diluted share  for workforce reduction and related costs 
the restructuring  which eliminated approximately positions  was primarily related to the announcement by at t corp 
at t that it would discontinue its marketing of local and long distance telephone services to consumers 
at t  our third largest client at the time of its announcement  accounted for approximately million and million of our fee revenues in and  respectively 
we expect that fee revenues from at t will represent million to million of our fee revenues 
we expect that our clients will  as a whole  continue to increase spending levels for our marketing and enablement services  and that our fee revenue will grow by approximately to  to million to million  in which would generate earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of to per diluted share 
because we derive substantially all of our revenues from the hourly billings of our employees  our utilization of those employees is one key indicator that we use to measure our operating performance 
we calculate utilization by dividing the total billable hours worked by our billable employees during the 
table of contents measurement period by the number of hours available to be worked during that period 
utilization was and for and  respectively 
historically  our largest relationships have the highest utilization rates  as we are more able to efficiently use resources to serve the client demand 
as we are able to scale additional client relationships  utilization rates should increase 
we fund our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
in  operations generated cash totaling million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options generated million 
we acquired million of cash and million of short term investments  totaling million  in the modem media acquisition and sold million of short term investments 
these increases to cash were offset primarily by million of capital expenditures and the repurchase of million shares of common stock for a total of million 
our credit facility allows us to borrow up to million less any amounts committed under outstanding standby letters of credit 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as of december  the credit facility expires in february at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately million outstanding under standby letters of credit  leaving approximately million available for future borrowings

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review and update these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  stock based compensation and restructuring  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our fee revenues from the performance of professional services 
individual projects generally last up to six months  however some of our projects may be longer in duration 
we generally enter into written agreements with our clients  under contracts that are typically terminable upon to days notice 
under these termination provisions  we would earn revenue based upon time and materials incurred or on a fixed price basis 
we recognize revenue earned under time and materials contracts as services are provided based upon hours worked and agreed upon hourly rates 
we recognize revenue earned under fixed price contracts  such as consulting arrangements  using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimates of total expected project costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the consultants on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
we use the proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
these estimates are based on historical experience and deliverables identified in the contract and are indicative of the level of benefit provided to our clients 
our financial management maintains contact with project managers to monitor the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and required resources to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue to be recognized and to estimate the income or loss on the project 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue and profit recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and profit 
if a contract was anticipated to result in a loss  provisions for the estimated loss on the contract would be made in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
there are no costs that are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
some of our contracts contain provisions for performance incentives 
such contingent revenue is recognized in the period in which the contingency is resolved 
we recognize revenue for services only in those situations where collection from the client is reasonably assured 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
our client relationship managers and finance personnel monitor timely payments from our clients and assess collection issues  if any 
unbilled accounts receivable on contracts is comprised of costs incurred plus estimated earnings from revenue earned in advance of billings under the contract 
we record advance payments as billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts until the services are provided 
included in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable are reimbursable costs 
we incur significant reimbursable costs on behalf of our clients 
these include payments to vendors for media and production services and postage and travel related expenses 
in accordance with our client agreements  we do not charge a markup on reimbursable costs and we require the client s approval prior to us incurring them 
although we actively mitigate our credit risk related to these pass through expenses and our customers participate in the management of vendor relationships  we are often the sole party that contracts with these vendors 
we account for pass through revenue and expenses in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and include these costs incurred as a component of revenue and as a component of operating expenses in the statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of clients to make required payments 
we continually assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices 
in estimating the allowance  we consider factors that include historical collections  historical write offs  a client s current credit worthiness  age of the receivable balance both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a client s ability to pay 
actual collections could differ from our estimates  requiring additional adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
accordingly  the preliminary purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets are valued separately based on estimates of future cash flows and those with a determinable useful life are amortized over their expected useful life 
amortizable intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows change and are significantly diminished  intangible assets may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure impairment  if any  based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows requires us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
in addition to million of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the modem media acquisition include customer relationships valued at million with a ten year life and trademarks valued at million with an indefinite useful life 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill when impaired 
these events or circumstances generally would include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
as we have one reporting segment  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by comparing our fair market value as determined by our publicly traded stock to our carrying amount 
we also considered future discounted cash flows as compared to the carrying amount to assess the recoverability of the goodwill asset 
based upon these tests  we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount resulting in no impairment 
if impairment had occurred  any excess of carrying value over fair value would have been recorded as a loss 
stock based compensation we apply the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion  or apbo  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our employee stock based compensation plans 
we provide pro forma disclosures of compensation expense under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
see our discussion of stock based compensation in note to the financial statements for the pro forma effect on our net income and income per share had stock based compensation been determined using the fair value method  as well as for the assumptions we used in calculating the fair value of options 
as noted above in recent accounting pronouncements  we will adopt sfas no 
r in the quarter ending september  restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated costs of the net lease expense for office space that is no longer being utilized 
the provision is equal to the future minimum lease payments under our contractual obligations offset by estimated future sublease income 
in determining these estimates  we evaluated 
table of contents the timing and our potential to sublease our excess space and our ability to renegotiate various leases at more favorable terms 
these sublease estimates  that were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at that time in the real estate and economic markets in which we have excess office space 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with our excess office space 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items included in our statements of operations as a percentage of fee revenue for the periods indicated

these contracts generally include estimates on total fees that clients will be charged for the year 
additionally  some of our contracts include a discretionary bonus provision whereby we earn additional compensation based on our performance as evaluated by our clients

in july  at t  our third largest client  announced that it would discontinue its marketing of local and long distance telephone services to consumers 
at t accounted for approximately million of our fee revenues in we expect that fee revenues from at t will represent million to million of our fee revenues 
while we anticipate that our clients  as a whole  will increase their expenditures for our marketing and enablement services in  the loss or any significant reduction in the use of our services by a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our top ten clients accounted for approximately of our fee revenue

restructuring expenses income  net 
restructuring expenses represent charges taken to better align our cost structure with changing market conditions and decreased demand for our services and to better approximate remaining real estate obligations related to our prior restructuring estimates 
restructuring expenses include severance related to workforce reductions and related expenses and the costs for consolidation of facilities 
costs for the consolidation of facilities are comprised of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space and asset impairment charges for fixed assets related to these spaces  less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions 
if actual conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with our excess office space 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary 
as noted above  we saw a continued increase in demand for our services in as fee revenues increased by million  or  to million from million in as clients continued to shift expenditures towards direct advertising channels such as the internet 
in addition  the acquisition of modem media on october  contributed approximately percentage points of the overall percentage points of fee revenue growth 
the increase in fee revenues combined with continued control of our cost structure resulted in net income of million  or per share  on a diluted basis compared to net income for of million  or per diluted share 
included in our net income is a restructuring expense of million  or per diluted share  for workforce reduction and related costs 
the restructuring  which eliminated approximately positions  was primarily related to the announcement by at t that it would discontinue its marketing of local and long distance telephone services to consumers 
in  we recorded restructuring income of million  or per diluted share  related to the reversal of restructuring expenses initially recorded in and 
table of contents revenue 
total revenue for increased by million  or  to million from million in fee revenue for increased by million  or  to million from million in pass through revenue for increased by million  or  to million from million in these increases in revenue are due to an increase in demand for our services from clients and the acquisition of modem media 
utilization was and for and  respectively 
in july  at t announced that it would discontinue its marketing of local and long distance telephone services to consumers 
as a result of at t s decision  at t notified us of its intent to terminate our services with respect to the marketing of local and long distance telephone services to consumers 
under the terms of our agreement  at t was required to make continued payments with respect to our services for a period of ninety days from the date of notification  even though substantially all of those services had ceased 
in  we recognized million of fee revenue related to these payments 
at t  our third largest client at the time of their announcement accounted for approximately million and million of our fee revenues in and  respectively 
we continue to provide services to other business units within at t and expect that fee revenues from at t will represent approximately million to million of our fee revenues 
professional services costs 
professional services costs for increased by million  or  to million from million in professional services costs represented and of fee revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in cost was the result of adding headcount to meet the increased demand for our services and from the modem media acquisition 
we added the equivalent of approximately full time billable employees during  approximately of them to meet increased client demand and approximately of them from the modem media acquisition 
in addition  the costs associated with the one time fee revenue from at t related to the contract termination provision have been included in professional services 
professional services costs as a percentage of fee revenue decreased due to the increase in demand for our services and the one time fee revenue from at t related to the contract termination provision 
we expect that professional service costs will continue to increase in as we will have a full year of costs related to the modem acquisition and we intend to increase our hiring to meet expected levels of demand 
professional services costs as a percentage of fee revenue should remain consistent with or improve slightly as we achieve higher levels of utilization from our existing resources 
pass through expenses 
pass through expenses are reimbursable costs incurred by digitas on behalf of our clients 
pass through expenses include payments to vendors for media and production services and postage and travel related expenses 
pass through expenses increased by million  or  to million from million in due to increased media programs and production costs for our clients in as compared to pass through expenses are offset by pass through revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  to million from million for as a percentage of fee revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is the result of an increase in compensation of million  an increase in rent and office expenses of million  an increase of relocation expenses associated with the modem media acquisition of million and an increase of professional services fees including sarbanes oxley of approximately million  offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million resulting from older assets becoming fully depreciated 
we added approximately non billable employees in october in connection with the modem media acquisition 
we also acquired office space in norwalk  san francisco and london 
the percentage decrease is a result of the increase in fee revenue 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of fee revenue will continue to decrease slightly in as a result of controlled levels of discretionary spending combined with expectations for increased fee revenue 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  consisting of non cash compensation  was million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to a large number of 
table of contents options granted with an exercise price below the estimated fair market value of the company s common stock prior to our initial public offering in march becoming fully expensed in the fourth quarter of we have not granted options nor issued common stock at a price below the estimated fair value subsequent to the initial public offering in march remaining deferred stock based compensation as of december  was fully expensed during in connection with the acquisition of modem media in  we recorded an additional million of deferred compensation related to acquired unvested options and recognized million of expense related to these options 
we expect to record compensation expense related to the vesting of these assumed options through in addition  commencing in the third quarter of  we will adopt sfas no 
r share based payment 
we expect the adoption of this standard to result in million to million of stock based compensation expense in amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased from million in to million in the increase is a result of the modem media acquisition in october in connection with that acquisition  we recorded an intangible asset of million for the customer base acquired 
this asset is being amortized over ten years 
we recorded million of expense in related to this asset 
restructuring expenses income  net 
in  we recorded restructuring expense of million consisting solely of workforce reduction and related costs 
we reduced our workforce by approximately people  primarily in our boston office 
this reduction was primarily in response to an announcement in july by at t that it would discontinue its marketing of local and long distance telephone services to consumers 
in  we recorded restructuring income of million as we reversed restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of leasehold improvements that we previously recorded in and during  we continued to make progress towards eliminating our excess real estate obligations as we were able to terminate our lease agreement in london  terminate our lease agreement for one restructured floor in boston and sublease previously restructured floors in other markets 
in connection with the modem media acquisition  we acquired accrued restructuring of million during the fourth quarter of approximately million of this amount is workforce related for payments of severance  which was recorded in connection with the acquisition and million is related to modem media real estate obligations net of estimated sublease income  of which approximately million was recorded in connection with the acquisition 
modem media has identified excess office space available in norwalk  san francisco and london 
approximately  square feet identified as excess space remained available for sublease as of december during  we made significant progress towards eliminating our excess real estate resulting in the recognition of million of restructuring income related to the reversal of restructuring expense initially recorded in and the restructuring expense was reversed because of savings of million as compared to our original estimates 
these savings were the result of subleasing our excess space at terms more favorable than estimates and assumptions made in  for savings of million  negotiating a termination of the salt lake city lease for less than our estimates  for savings of million and returning one floor initially restructured in san francisco to operations  which represented savings of million 
the million in savings was offset by revisions in estimates of future sublease rates and terms for remaining leases resulting in an increase in expected future obligations of million 
we continue to evaluate alternatives and monitor our restructuring accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions in the real estate markets in which we lease office space 
these sublease estimates  which were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at the time in the real estate and economic markets in which we determined we had excess office space 
at december   approximately  square feet of the approximately  square feet initially identified as excess remained available for sublease 
the floor returned to operations in san francisco was restructured in the third quarter of because we had committed to a plan to redeploy  reorganize and streamline the workforce in san francisco and relocate in to a more efficient and cost effective office location 
at the time of the restructuring charge  the floor was 
table of contents being used in operations 
all costs associated with this floor including rent expense  operating expenses and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements continued to be included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations  with an expectation that all costs would continue to be included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses until the plan to vacate the space was implemented 
the initial plan communicated to the workforce was scheduled to be implemented in january  but was subsequently postponed due to some incremental projects won in december and january many of the changes in workforce were implemented over the first two quarters of as the skill sets of those identified were not required to serve the new projects 
although the initial plan to vacate the facility was postponed  we continued to expect that in the floor would be vacated and the employees in the region would be relocated to more efficient and cost effective space 
although we allowed in our restructuring plan for a significant vacancy period due to the poor real estate market in san francisco  we actively marketed the floor throughout with the intent of securing a subtenant to minimize the cash flow drain to us for paying rent on the new location while the old location remained vacant 
however  in the fourth quarter of it became apparent that the original plan to vacate the floor was not likely to be carried out  as originally developed by us and approved by the board of directors  and that the floor should continue to be used in operations 
this decision was made because certain client relationships expanded at a pace exceeding our initial budget estimates and expectations  improved business expectations with additional clients previously thought to be declining relationships  and the hiring in december of a new president for the san francisco office 
we continue to evaluate our alternatives and monitor our restructuring accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions in the real estate markets in which we lease office space 
sublease estimates  which were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at the time in the real estate and economic markets in which we determined we had excess office space 
at december   approximately  square feet remains available for sublease 
at december   our restructuring accrual totaled million 
approximately million of this balance is workforce related for final payments of severance and will be fully utilized in the remaining million is related to remaining real estate obligations net of sublease income 
approximately million will be utilized in with the remaining amount utilized over the following six years 
we believe the restructuring accrual is appropriate and adequate to cover remaining obligations

the remaining increase of approximately million was grant income from the state of new york for achieving certain employment levels in that state 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary

stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  consisting of non cash compensation  was million for compared to million for the decrease is due to the cancellation of stock options prior to their vesting dates in connection with attrition 
we have not granted or repurchased any options or issued common stock at a price below the estimated fair market value subsequent to the initial public offering in march restructuring expenses income  net 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring income of million as we reversed restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of leasehold improvements that we previously recorded in and in  we recorded restructuring expenses totaling million 
during  we recorded restructuring expenses totaling million  consisting of million for workforce reduction and related costs and million for the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of related leasehold improvements 
these charges were recorded to further align the cost structure with changing market conditions and to update estimates of remaining real estate obligations originally made in for current information 
the facility charge in represented an estimate of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
in determining this estimate  management evaluated its potential to sublease its excess space and its ability to renegotiate various leases at more favorable terms and in some instances obtain relief through relocation of office space 
throughout  we continued to monitor the economic conditions of the real estate market  which showed little sign of recovery as the economy continued to decline in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks 
although more space became available in the markets in which we had excess real estate  we were actively pursuing several alternatives including sublease opportunities and lease renegotiations 
during the third quarter of  management determined that due to the limited success on subleasing opportunities and lease renegotiation activities  we would be unable to dispose of our excess office space in boston  new york and san francisco within our original assumptions 
as a result  we recorded additional restructuring expenses of million to reflect the revised estimate 
the change in estimate was related to changes in estimated future sublease rates and terms 
these sublease estimates  which were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at the time in the real estate and economic markets in which we determined we had excess office space 
in addition  we recorded restructuring expenses of million for costs related to the closure of our miami and salt lake city facilities 
during  we made significant progress towards eliminating our excess real estate resulting in the recognition of million of restructuring income related to the reversal of restructuring expense initially recorded in and the restructuring expense was reversed because of savings of million as compared to our original estimates 
these savings were the result of subleasing our excess space at terms more favorable than estimates and assumptions made in  for savings of million  negotiating a termination of the salt lake city lease for less than our estimates  for savings of million and returning one floor initially restructured in san francisco to operations  which represented savings of million 
the million in savings was offset by revisions in estimates of future sublease rates and terms for remaining leases resulting in an increase in expected future obligations of million 
we continue to evaluate alternatives and monitor our restructuring accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions in the real estate markets in which we lease office space 
these sublease estimates  which were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at the time in the real estate and economic markets in which we determined we had excess office space 
at december   approximately  square feet of the approximately  square feet initially identified as excess remained available for sublease 

table of contents the floor returned to operations in san francisco was restructured in the third quarter of because we had committed to a plan to redeploy  reorganize and streamline the workforce in san francisco and relocate in to a more efficient and cost effective office location 
at the time of the restructuring charge  the floor was being used in operations 
all costs associated with this floor including rent expense  operating expenses and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements continued to be included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations  with an expectation that all costs would continue to be included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses until the plan to vacate the space was implemented 
the initial plan communicated to the workforce was scheduled to be implemented in january  but was subsequently postponed due to some incremental projects won in december and january many of the changes in workforce were implemented over the first two quarters of as the skill sets of those identified were not required to serve the new projects 
although the initial plan to vacate the facility was postponed  we continued to expect that in the floor would be vacated and the employees in the region would be relocated to more efficient and cost effective space 
although we allowed in our restructuring plan for a significant vacancy period due to the poor real estate market in san francisco  we actively marketed the floor throughout with the intent of securing a subtenant to minimize the cash flow drain to us for paying rent on the new location while the old location remained vacant 
however  in the fourth quarter of it became apparent that the original plan to vacate the floor was not likely to be carried out  as originally developed by us and approved by the board of directors  and that the floor should continue to be used in operations 
this decision was made because certain client relationships expanded at a pace exceeding our initial budget estimates and expectations  improved business expectations with additional clients previously thought to be declining relationships  the hiring in december of a new president for the san francisco office and continued poor market conditions for real estate in san francisco  which would likely result in the floor remaining vacant for a lengthy period of time 
at december   our restructuring accrual totaled million 
approximately million of that amount is workforce related for final payments of severance and will be fully utilized in the remaining million is related to remaining real estate obligations net of sublease income 
we believe the restructuring accrual of million is appropriate and adequate to cover these remaining obligations

the decrease in other income was due primarily to the decrease in the rate of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
cash and cash equivalents and working capital cash and cash equivalents increased from million at december  to million at december  cash provided by operations was primarily driven by net income of million for the period plus noncash expenses including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation of million  plus the increase in accounts payable of million related to the increase in pass through expenses and the timing of when invoices were received and the increase in deferred revenue of million  offset by payments for restructuring activities and executive bonuses

as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately million outstanding under standby letters of credit  leaving approximately million available for future borrowings 
stock repurchase programs in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a common stock repurchase program which expired on december  in november  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common stock between december  and june  under a common stock repurchase program 
in july  the board of directors increased the company s stock repurchase program from million to million and extended the term through december  during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  during the year ended december   the company did not repurchase any shares

these amounts are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
in april  we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of office space in our new boston facility 
the lease commences upon the earlier of december  or the date we occupy the space and expires in november we expect to commence construction of improvements to our new office space in march total contractual obligations under the lease  assuming a december  commencement date  are million  which is included in the table above 
rent payments due in the future for both operating and restructured office space are reflected in the cash obligations table above 
notes payable  tenant allowances 
since  we have received tenant allowances  which are required to be reimbursed to the landlord through in connection with the acquisition of modem  we acquired debt of million related to amounts advanced to modem in november for leasehold improvements at the company s norwalk  connecticut office 
payments for these advances are to be made in equal monthly installments and bear an interest rate of per annum 
the total outstanding amount of these advances and notes payable was million as of december   which includes million related to digitas 
operating lease guarantee 
modem media is a guarantor for the office lease obligations of centrport  inc  or centrport 
as of december   the aggregate remaining base rent and estimated operating expenses due under this lease were million  subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the lease 
the balance is scheduled to be reduced by approximately million per year through june  the lease provides that once of the original lease term has expired  which will occur in july  this guaranty may be replaced with an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount not to exceed the remaining base rent 
in addition  upon expiration of of the lease term  centrport is required to obtain such a letter of credit 
in the event that centrport were to default on its lease obligation  we would be liable for the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses at the time of default by centrport 
in the event of a default  we would take all appropriate actions to be reimbursed for this liability 

table of contents prior to our acquisition of modem media  modem media management had evaluated its potential obligation under the centrport lease guarantee and specifically considered the following factors in this regard a centrport s ability to reduce its cash burn rate and preserve cash on hand  b the probability that centrport would be sold within the near future  c the timing as to when centrport could potentially default on their lease  d the potential for centrport to raise additional funds  and e the potential for centrport to sell its remaining assets customer base 
they noted that in particular  centrport continued to be unable to obtain new sources of funding  its operating performance continued to deteriorate and cash on hand continued to decline 
as a result  they concluded that an accrual of a loss contingency for the centrport lease guarantee was required in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for loss contingencies  which states that a loss contingency should be accrued when the loss contingency is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
accordingly  at the time of the acquisition  a million liability had been recorded by modem media management related to this guarantee 
we expect that at current revenue projections  we will continue to generate cash from operations 
we believe that cash from operations combined with current cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
internal control structure 
as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of  we must determine that we have established and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures over financial reporting 
we have assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december  our assessment was based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  or coso  internal control integrated framework 
our evaluation of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excludes modem media  a significant business  which we acquired on october  the acquisition of modem media contributed approximately  or million  in fee revenue in the purchase price of the acquisition was approximately million 
during the year ended december  modem media s last full fiscal year prior to the acquisition  modem media generated revenues of million and net income of million 
at december   modem media had total assets of million and total stockholders equity of million 
our management s report on internal control over financial reporting for fiscal will include modem media 
risks factors and important factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully read the following risk factors  together with the financial statements  related notes and other information contained in this form k 
this form k contains forward looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties 
please refer to the discussion of forward looking statements on page three in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below 
risks related to our business the loss of even one significant client or any significant reduction in the use of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from large scale engagements with a limited number of clients 
most of these relationships  including those with digitas inc s three largest clients  are terminable by the client without penalty on to days prior written notice 
for the twelve months ended december   digitas inc s three largest clients  general motors  american express and at t corp  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of digitas inc s fee revenue 
for the twelve months ended december   general motors  american express and at t accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of digitas inc s fee revenue 
the loss of any major client or any significant reduction in the use of digitas inc s services by a major client could materially reduce digitas inc s revenue and have a negative impact on digitas inc s operating results  financial condition and reputation in digitas inc s market 
for example  in july  at t announced that it had decided to change its business focus and informed us of a 
table of contents significant reduction in its demand for our services 
at t was our third largest client at that time  accounting for approximately million and million of our fee revenues in and  respectively 
although we continue to provide services to at t  we expect that fee revenues from at t will represent less than million to million of our fee revenues 
due to digitas inc s dependence on a limited number of clients  it is subject to a concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable 
in the case of insolvency by one of digitas inc s significant clients  accounts receivable with respect to that client would potentially be uncollectible  adversely affecting digitas inc s financial performance 
for example  delta air lines represented approximately million  or of digitas inc s total gross accounts receivable as of december   however  our overall exposure with delta air lines may vary depending upon the timing of when payments are received 
during and again in march  delta air lines disclosed in its reports filed with the sec that if it cannot achieve a competitive cost structure  regain sustained profitability and access capital markets on acceptable terms  it will need to pursue alternative courses of action intended to make it viable for the long term  including the possibility of seeking to restructure its costs under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
digitas inc continues to monitor this situation 
our failure to meet clients expectations could result in losses or negative publicity and could subject us to liability for the services we provide 
as clients have dedicated more money and resources to our engagements with them  their expectations have also increased 
as client engagements become larger and more complex and are required to be completed in a shorter time frame  we face increased management challenges and greater risk of mistakes 
any failure on our part to deliver services in accordance with clients expectations could result in additional expenditures to correct the problem  delayed or lost client revenues  adverse client reactions and negative publicity  and claims against us 
although client agreements often limit our liability to damages arising from the rendering of services  we cannot assure that these provisions will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect it from liability 
while we carry general liability insurance coverage  insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
failure to manage our growth may impact operating results 
if we succeed in expanding our business  that expansion may place increased demands on our management  operating systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
if not managed effectively  these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing clients 
in addition  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations 
consequently  in order to manage growth effectively  we may be required to increase expenditures to expand  train and manage employee base  improve management  financial and information systems and controls  or make other capital expenditures 
our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting  forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available  and which may dilute the ownership interests of current investors 
we may need to raise additional funds to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs and to otherwise support our business and implement strategy 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to create additional market specific business units  
table of contents enhance infrastructure  hire  train and retain employees  keep up with technological advances  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
failure to do any of these things could restrict the growth  hinder the ability to compete and seriously harm our financial condition 
additionally  if we are able to raise additional funds through equity financings  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
acts of war or terrorism  or related effects could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
a significant amount of our revenue comes from clients whose businesses are particularly vulnerable to war and terrorism because they work in industries that include financial services  travel related services and the hospitality industry 
an act of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the related effects of an act of war or terrorism  such as disruptions in air transportation  enhanced security measures and political instability in certain foreign countries may interrupt our business and that of our clients 
an act of war or terrorism may result in a significant reduction in client spending or contribute to an economic downturn and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may result in a reduction in our revenues and operating results 
our ability to succeed depends on the continued investment by our current and future clients in the services that we offer 
in the past our business has been adversely impacted by a decline in demand for digitas inc s services  primarily related to an overall economic downturn 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states and abroad may cause some of our current and future clients to reduce or eliminate their budgets for our services 
furthermore  the reduction in client budgets may intensify competition and further increase pressure for us to reduce the fees charged to clients 
a lasting economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
actual and perceived conflicts of interest may restrict us in obtaining new clients 
actual and perceived conflicts of interest are inherent in our industry 
our agencies have entered into exclusivity arrangements with several of their clients that prohibit them from providing services to competitors of those clients 
in addition  although not contractually prohibited from providing services to a competitor of a client  our agencies sometimes decline to accept potential clients because of actual or perceived conflicts of interest with their existing clients or because a client insists  for whatever reason  that the agency not work with its competitors 
in addition  potential clients may choose not to retain our agencies for reasons of actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
many of our agencies clients compete in industries where only a limited number of companies gain meaningful market share 
as a result  if one of our agencies decides not to perform services for a particular client s competitors  or if potential clients choose not to retain them because of actual or perceived conflicts and the agency client fails to capture a significant portion of its market  that agency may receive reduced or no future revenue in that particular industry 
clients of modem media and clients of the digitas agency that compete with one another may not be satisfied with the organizational steps we have taken to address the actual or perceived conflicts of interest and may choose not to continue to engage our agencies for services 
we may need to increase reserves for surplus office space if subtenants fail to pay their rent 
as part of a series of cost reduction efforts  we determined that we had surplus office space 
as a result of these efforts  we abandoned the surplus office space and recorded reserves for lease liabilities based on minimum lease payments for the space abandoned net of the rent we estimated we could realize upon subletting the space 

table of contents we have sublet approximately  square feet of surplus boston office space  approximately  square feet of surplus new york city office space  approximately  square feet of surplus san francisco office space and approximately  square feet of surplus miami office space and we have fully assigned one of our leases in london for approximately  square feet of office space 
the boston subleases expire in november and december  the new york sublease expires in march  the san francisco sublease expires in january  and the miami sublease expires january if one or more subtenants fail to pay digitas inc their rent  digitas inc may need to increase reserves  depending on the circumstances at the time 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results can be volatile 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
however  if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate in the future include the following variability in market demand for services  length of the sales cycle associated with service offerings  unanticipated variations in the size  budget  number or progress toward completion of engagements  unanticipated termination of a major engagement  a client s decision not to proceed with an anticipated engagement or the completion or delay during a quarter of several major client engagements  our ability to manage operating costs  a large portion of which are fixed in advance of any particular quarter  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  our ability to manage future growth and retain employees  timing and amount of client bonus payments  and costs of attracting and training skilled personnel 
some of these factors are within our control while others are outside of our control 
if we are not successful in expanding our ability to service clients on a worldwide basis  we may jeopardize relationships with existing clients and limit our ability to attract new clients 
failure to meet client demands that their relationship marketing service providers be able to handle assignments on a worldwide basis may jeopardize our existing client relationships and limit our ability to attract new clients 
currently  modem media serves european markets from its office in london and both of our agencies can serve markets in other regions from offices in the united states 
to succeed we may also need to deepen and broaden expertise in dealing with worldwide assignments by expanding our presence outside of the united states or by hiring more senior executives with multi national technology  marketing and customer relationship management expertise  and there is no assurance that we can attract those people or establish on a profitable basis offices outside of the united states 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting services outside of north america and the united kingdom  and development of those skills may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
operations outside the united states may be unprofitable or less profitable than operations in the united states  especially due to language barriers  cultural differences  economic and political conditions in countries outside the united states  currency exchange risks  differences in terms of payment and collectibility of receivables  
table of contents reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the burden and expense of complying with foreign laws and regulations and the fact that the internet infrastructure in foreign countries may be less advanced than in the united states 
we must maintain our reputation and expand name recognition to remain competitive 
we believe that establishing and maintaining name recognition and a good reputation for us and our agencies is critical to attracting and expanding a targeted client base as well as attracting and retaining qualified employees 
if our reputation is damaged or if we are unable to establish name recognition  we may become less competitive or lose market share 
in addition  our name  or the name of either agency  could be associated with any business difficulties of our agencies clients 
as a result  the difficulties or failure of one of our clients could damage our reputation and name and make it difficult for us to compete for new business 
our business will be negatively affected if we do not keep up with rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and changing client requirements 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and changing client needs 
accordingly  our future success will depend  in part  on the ability to meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner 
among the most important challenges facing us is the need to effectively use leading technologies  continue to develop strategic and technical expertise  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  enhance current service offerings  and develop new services that meet changing customer needs 
our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  if we cannot effectively compete  our revenue may decline 
our industry is relatively new and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify even further as the industry evolves 
some of our current competitors have more clients  greater brand or name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
furthermore  there are relatively low barriers to entry into our industry 
as a result  new and unknown market entrants pose a threat to our business 
current or future competitors may also develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price  which could affect our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish corporate relationships among themselves or other third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing competitors or any new competitors 
potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt business  adversely affect operating results and dilute shareholder value 
in october  we acquired modem media  inc  a provider of interactive marketing strategy services 
we may acquire other businesses in the future  which may complicate our management tasks 
we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to do so could result in our inability to retain the management  key personnel  employees and clients of the acquired business 
such integration efforts also may distract our management from servicing existing clients 
failure to manage future 
table of contents acquisitions successfully could seriously harm operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our stockholders could be diluted if we finance the acquisitions by issuing equity securities 
increased government regulation of various direct marketing channels and the marketing of some products could adversely affect our business 
state and federal government regulation of various direct marketing channels  such as the internet  electronic mail and telephone  and regulation of the marketing of some products  such as pharmaceuticals  is increasing 
new laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing clients from using certain direct marketing methods 
for example  privacy laws have curtailed the use of information by companies 
violations of these laws and regulations could also result in liability for us and our clients 
new laws and regulations could create limitations on clients ability to market to targeted customers which in turn could decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance 
risks related to the securities markets our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
since completing our initial public offering in march  the market price for our common stock has been as high as per share and as low as per share 
additionally  the stock market in general  and the market for technology related stocks in particular  has been highly volatile and was characterized by significant decreases in market prices during  and this volatility often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to perceived prospects  variations in operating results and achievement of key business targets  changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates  differences between reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts or service offerings by us or our competitors  market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
risks related to legal uncertainty we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee that the steps taken to protect proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously 
table of contents harmed 
in addition  although we believe our proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
if any party asserts a claim against us relating to proprietary technology or information  we may need to obtain licenses to the disputed intellectual property 
we cannot guarantee  however  that we will be able to obtain any licenses at all 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states so  as our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase 
changes in government regulation of the internet and other emerging technologies could adversely affect our business 
to date  government regulations have not materially restricted the use of the internet and other emerging technologies by our clients in their markets 
however  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to such technologies may change 
new state  federal and foreign laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  especially those relating to privacy  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing clients from delivering products or services over technology based distribution channels 
failure to comply with applicable government regulations could result in liability 
any new legislation could inhibit the increased use of the internet and emerging technologies as commercial mediums which in turn could decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on future operating performance 
we may become subject to claims regarding foreign laws and regulations that could result in increased expenses 
because we plan to expand international operations and because many of our current clients have international operations  we may be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions 
these laws may change  or new  more restrictive laws may be enacted in the future 
failure to comply with applicable foreign laws and regulations could result in a liability 
international litigation is often expensive and time consuming and could distract management s attention away from the operation of the business 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and by laws may make a takeover more difficult 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors 
public shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors  which makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or to change our management and board of directors 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of january  each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of one ten thousandth of a share of series a junior participating cumulative preferred stock for per unit 
under circumstances specified in the plan  if a person or group acquires percent or more of our outstanding common stock  holders of the rights other than the person or group that triggered the exercise will be able to purchase  for the exercise price  shares of our common stock or common stock of any company into which we have merged having a market value of the rights expire on january   unless extended by our board of directors 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors
