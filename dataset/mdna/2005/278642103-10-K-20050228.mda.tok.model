executive operating and financial summary our focus is on understanding our key operating and financial metrics members of our senior management team regularly review key operating metrics such as new users  active users  listings and gross merchandise volume as well as new user accounts and total payment volume processed by our wholly owned paypal subsidiary 
members of our senior management also regularly review key financial information including net revenues  operating income margins  earnings per share  cash flows from operations and free cash flows  which we define as operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment  net 
these operating and financial measures allow us to monitor the health and vibrancy of our 
table of contents marketplace and our global payments platform  and the profitability of our business and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make in the areas of international expansion  customer support  product development  marketing and site operations 
we believe that an understanding of these key operating and financial measures and how they change over time is important to investors  analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities 
our expectations for growth we expect that our growth in net revenues during will result primarily from increased net transaction revenues across our us marketplace  international marketplace and payments segments 
we continue to make investments in our business and infrastructure to help us achieve our long term growth objectives 
we expect to continue our investments in the areas of international expansion for both our ebay marketplace and our paypal businesses  customer support  site operations  marketing and various corporate infrastructure areas 
we believe these investments are necessary to support the long term demands of our growing business as well as to build the infrastructure necessary to support long term growth 
in addition  to the extent that the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  and  in particular  the euro and the british pound  the remeasurement of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars will negatively impact our consolidated net revenues and  to the extent that they are not hedged  our net income

the payments segment reflects the historical operations of our former billpoint subsidiary and of paypal s operations for the periods subsequent to our acquisition of paypal on october  we completed our planned wind down of billpoint in the first half of our net revenues result from fees associated with our transaction  advertising and other services in our us marketplace  international marketplace and payments segments 
net transaction revenues are derived primarily from listing  feature and final value fees paid by sellers and fees from payment processing services 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements

for  the growth in our international marketplace segment net transaction revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net transaction revenues  was primarily the result of strong performances in the united kingdom and south korea and a solid performance in germany 
the relative strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar resulted in increased net revenues of approximately million during  when compared to the results if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements were used

significant cost components include bank charges  credit card interchange  other payment processing costs  employee compensation and facilities costs for our customer support and site operations  depreciation of equipment and amortization of required capitalization of major site and product development costs 
the increase in cost of net revenues during was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions on the paypal and ebay websites and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure 
the decrease in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to ebay s marketplace s site operations costs growing at a slower rate than net revenues 
payment processing costs increased to million in from million in  due to the increase in paypal s total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to the growth of our ebay marketplace activity

employee related costs increased by million in as we continued to expand our domestic and international operations 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in total and as a percentage of net revenues during in addition  our online marketing expenses will likely increase both in total and slightly as a percentage of revenues because of increases in the volume of online advertising that we expect to purchase in order to attract new customers and increase the activity on our websites including growth initiatives in sales and marketing activities in our us and international marketplaces  including china 
sales and marketing expenses increased in  but decreased as a percentage of total net revenues due to cost efficiencies in our business and the acquisition of paypal  which has a significantly lower sales and marketing requirement as paypal benefits from ebay customer acquisitions

these capitalized costs totaled million in  million in and million in  and are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to the ebay and paypal platforms 

table of contents the increase in product development expenses in  as compared to the prior year  was primarily the result of increased headcount and consultant costs 
the headcount growth was focused on hiring new employees for various platform development initiatives at ebay and paypal in addition to our international expansion of both platforms

general and administrative expenses increased in total  but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in  as compared to the prior year 
the dollar increase was due primarily to employee related costs  fees for external professional advisors  including sarbanes oxley compliance costs  and payment transaction loss expenses 
the increases in employee related costs resulted from growth in the finance  human resource and legal departments to meet the demands of our expanding business  including growing international operations  increased regulatory demands  and the integration of acquired businesses

in february  we began migrating ebay users from our legacy billing system to a newly implemented billing system 
as we managed this migration  we delayed billing cycles to facilitate the migration process and to allow additional time for quality assurance reviews 
the delay in billing cycles continued for the remainder of the year and resulted in an increase in the average days our customer account balances were outstanding 
although we believe this change in account balance aging is a temporary condition  our historical experience indicates an increased risk of collection for aged accounts receivable balances 
accordingly  our provision for doubtful accounts during the year ended december  increased to a total of million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  during the year ended december  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at december  was million

payroll tax on employee stock options percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages payroll tax on employee stock options as a percentage of net revenues we are subject to employer payroll taxes on employee gains from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
these employer payroll taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period in which such options are exercised and sold based on actual gains realized by employees 
the increases in and as compared to the respective prior years were primarily a result of larger individual gains recognized on stock option exercises by our employees during periods in which our stock price was high relative to historic levels 
our results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that stock options are exercised by employees and  consequently  the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed 
in general  we expect payroll taxes on employee stock option gains to increase during periods in which our stock price is high relative to historic levels 
amortization of acquired intangible assets percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets as a percentage of net revenues from time to time we have purchased  and we expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion  increase the features  functions  and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online trading 
these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods 

table of contents intangible assets include purchased customer lists and user base  trademarks and trade names  developed technologies  and other intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets  excluding goodwill  using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
our annual impairment test was carried out as of august  and we determined that there was no impairment 
there were no events or circumstances from that date through december  that would impact this assessment 
we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets will increase in as a result of the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of mobile 
de and marktplaats 
nl  as well as our additional investment in internet auction during and our recent acquisition of rent 
com 
amortization of acquired intangible assets will also increase should we make additional acquisitions in the future 
non operating items interest and other income  net percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income  net as a percentage of net revenues interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and other non operating transactions 
our interest and other income  net increased in total and as a percentage of net revenues during as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of gains from the sale of an equity investment and amendments to certain sublease agreements 
in addition  we recorded increased interest income primarily due to higher investment balances  and increased cash and cash equivalents balances 
the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio increased to in from in we expect that interest and other income  net  will remain generally comparable in total to during our interest and other income  net decreased in total and as a percentage of net revenues during  primarily as a result of one time gains recognized in from the sale of certain subsidiaries  real estate properties and an equity investment that totaled million 
this decrease was offset  in part  by increased investment income on a larger aggregate balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments even though the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio declined to in from in interest expense percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages interest expense as a percentage of net revenues interest expense consists of interest charges on our consolidated lease arrangement related to our san jose headquarters office facilities  capital leases  and mortgage notes 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in accordance with the provisions of this standard  we have included our san jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective july  beginning july   our consolidated statement of income reflects the reclassification of lease payments on our san jose headquarters office facilities from operating expense to interest expense 
the increase in interest expense during  compared to the prior year  was primarily the result of the inclusion of interest payments on our san jose headquarters office facilities 
the increase in interest expense during is primarily the result of the inclusion of these interest payments for a full year in we expect our interest expense will decrease both in total and as a percentage of net revenue during due to the acquisition of the san jose headquarters office facilities at the expiration of the lease arrangement on march  impairment of certain equity investments percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages impairment of certain equity investments   n a as a percentage of net revenues n a during and  we recorded impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively  as a result of the deterioration of the financial condition of certain of our private and public equity investees 
we identified these impairment losses as part of our normal process of assessing the quality of our investment portfolio 
the impairment loss reflects a decline in fair value and other market conditions that we believe are other than temporary 
we expect that the fair value of our equity investments will fluctuate from time to time and future impairment assessments may result in additional charges to our operating results 
we did not record any impairment of our equity investments during provision for income taxes percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes as a percentage of net revenues effective tax rate the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to non deductible expenses related to acquisitions  state taxes  subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other factors that increase the effective tax rate 
these expenses are partially offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates  tax credits  and tax exempt interest income 
the lower effective tax rates in and as compared to the respective prior years reflect the increasing profit contribution from our international operations that are subject to lower tax rates 
we receive tax deductions from the gains realized by employees on the exercise of certain non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recognized as a component of stockholders equity 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets relating to these stock option deductions along with our other deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is required for that portion of the total deferred tax assets that is not considered more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
to the extent that the deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance become realizable in future periods  we will have the ability  subject to carryforward limitations  to use up to million of deferred tax assets to reduce future income tax liabilities 
should a valuation allowance no longer be required  the reversal of the valuation allowance will be reflected as an increase in additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision

third parties held minority interests in various of our subsidiaries during  and the change in minority interests in is due primarily to our acquisition of an additional ownership interest in internet auction 
the change in minority interests in primarily resulted from the minority interests portion of the net income generated by internet auction 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in accordance with the provisions of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  we have included our san jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective july  our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  reflects the reclassification of lease payments on our san jose headquarters from operating expense to interest expense  beginning with the quarters following our adoption of fin on july   a million after tax charge for cumulative depreciation for periods from lease inception through june   and incremental depreciation expense of approximately  net of tax  per quarter for periods after june  we have adopted the provisions of fin prospectively from july   and as a result  have not restated prior periods 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle arising from the adoption of fin has been reflected in net income in impact of foreign currency translation during  our international net revenues  based upon the country in which the seller  payment recipient  advertiser or other service provider is located  accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues  as compared to of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
net revenues and related expenses generated from international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries  and include euros  british pounds  korean won  canadian dollars  taiwanese dollars  and australian dollars 
the results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased consolidated net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
similarly  our consolidated net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
during  the us dollar weakened against the foreign currencies listed above 
using the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from  our net revenues for would have been lower than we reported using the actual exchange rates for by approximately million  of which million and million relate to our international marketplace and payments segments  respectively 
in addition  if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from were applied to our cost of revenues and operating expenses for  these costs of revenues and operating expenses would have been lower in total than we reported using the actual exchange rates for by approximately million 
the majority of this impact relates to the relative strength of the euro against the us dollar 

table of contents we expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplace and global payments platform 
as a result  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and net income 
see the information in item a under foreign currency risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities 
foreign exchange hedging policy we are a rapidly growing company  with an increasing proportion of our operations outside the united states 
accordingly  our foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are expected to continue to grow 
the objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows  and results of operations 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  economic and translation transaction exposure around the world  we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
economic exposure we also have anticipated and unrecognized future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
our primary economic exposures include future royalty receivables  customer collections  and vendor payments 
changes in the relevant entity s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows 
we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction is settled 
earnings translation exposure as our international operations grow  fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations 
such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss recorded in interest and other income  net 
employee stock options we continue to believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program 
we grant options to substantially all employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract  motivate  and retain high quality employees  to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders 
stock options granted during the year ended december  and  net of cancellations  represented approximately of our total outstanding common stock at december  and  a substantial portion of which was granted to new employees 
we expect that our stock option grants  net of cancellations  for will represent approximately of our total outstanding common stock at december  
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements share based payments in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is our third fiscal quarter in upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice see note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of fas r 
compensation expense calculated under fas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of fas r we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated statement of income and financial condition 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended december  in thousands consolidated cash flow data net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we have generated annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income in  and this result was driven mainly by non cash charges to earnings 
non cash charges to earnings included depreciation and amortization on our long term assets  tax benefits on the exercise of employee stock options resulting from our increasing stock price and the related increases in the personal gains recognized by our employees  provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for transaction losses resulting from increased total payment volumes processed by our paypal subsidiary 
in and  operating cash flows were also positively impacted by the net cash amounts provided by year over year changes in working capital assets and liabilities 
the net cash used in investing activities in  and reflected primarily the movement of cash and cash equivalents between cash and cash equivalents and investments  the purchase of property and equipment  and acquisitions 
purchases of property and equipment  net totaled million in  million in  and million in purchases of property and equipment in and related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site operations  customer support and international expansion 
in  purchases of property and equipment included the million purchase of additional office space in san jose  california

our cash acquisitions in included acquiring the remaining ownership interest in our billpoint subsidiary and a interest in eachnet  located in china 
we completed our acquisition of paypal during through the exchange of our common stock for paypal s then outstanding common stock 
the net cash flows provided by financing activities in  and were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million in  million in  and million in our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of our stock price  the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels 
the positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during   and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the 
table of contents foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  our business could suffer 
we expect capital expenditures to amount to between million and million during  without taking into account any acquisitions or the million associated with the purchase of our san jose headquarters facility 
on february   we paid million  net of rent

see subsequent events within this section for further details 
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands other payment due by year ending capital operating purchase december  leases leases obligations total thereafter capital lease amounts primarily comprises the assumed purchase of the corporate headquarters in san jose  california  in march  when the lease is scheduled to expire  and includes the million in relation to the non controlling minority interest 
see note long term obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
other purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  computer equipment  software applications  a corporate airplane  engineering development services and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
for those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements  we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations 
these estimates have been developed based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
other financial arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have  a future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
in a limited number of agreements  including agreements under which we have developed technology for certain commercial parties  we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  substantially all of which are indemnities related to our copyrights  trademarks  and patents 
to date  no significant costs have been incurred  either individually or collectively  in connection with our indemnification provisions

in january  our board of directors approved a two for one split of our shares of common stock to be issued in the form of a stock dividend 
as a result of the stock split  our stockholders received one additional share of our common stock for each share of common stock held of record on january  the additional shares of our common stock were distributed on february  all share and per share amounts in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 

table of contents provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized credits our us marketplace and international marketplace segments are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience  are monitored monthly  and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense  while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
the following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for   and in thousands  except percentages 
years ended december  net revenues from the us and international marketplace segments provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a of net revenues from the us and international marketplace segments historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
based on our results for the year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points income from operating impact related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits income from operations net income diluted earnings per share provision for transaction losses our payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse  as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through paypal 
we establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions  such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services  ach returns  and debit card overdrafts 
these allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts  using an actuarial technique  necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date  including those of which we have not yet been notified 
the allowances are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors 
the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 
the provision for transaction loss expense is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the transaction loss reserve totaled million and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the following table illustrates the provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of total payment volume from paypal operations for the period from october  date of acquisition of paypal through december  and for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages 
period from october  through year ended year ended december  december  december  total payment volume transaction loss expense as a of total payment volume the establishment of appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
based on our results for the year ended december   a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points transaction loss expense income from operations net income diluted earnings per share legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies litigation and other legal matters to our consolidated financial statements  which we incorporate herein 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three segments 
accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also 
table of contents assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of  the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income 
where the change in the valuation allowance relates to the deduction for employee stock option exercises  the change is reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital 
as employee stock option exercises are highly dependent upon our stock price  it is extremely difficult to predict the amount of deductions that will be generated from future option exercises and  therefore  for us to ascertain the amount of deferred tax assets related to employee stock option exercises that may be realized in future periods 
at december   we have maintained an allowance on certain net operating losses generated from deductions for employee stock option expenses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to these net operating losses will not be realized 
the deferred tax asset  net of a valuation allowance of million  totaled million at december  and was offset by deferred tax liabilities of million resulting in a net deferred tax liability of million 
in addition  due to our significant anticipated international expansion  we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely  we would be subject to us income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits 
the following table illustrates the effective tax rates for   and in thousands  except percentages years ended december  provision for income taxes effective tax rates historically  these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities 
however  unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points provision for income taxes income from operations net income diluted earnings per share advertising and other non transaction revenues a portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other non transaction services in our us marketplace  international marketplace and payments segments 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements 
other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay users and from offline services provided by wholly owned subsidiaries that were divested in the second half of advertising and other non transaction net revenues  including barter transactions  totaled  and of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  and were primarily generated by our us marketplace segment 
revenue from barter arrangements totaled million in both and  and million in certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate 
table of contents revenue recognition  including  but not limited to  the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements  the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and  for barter transactions  the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values 
our advertising and other non transaction net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general 
unlike our transaction revenues  advertising and other non transaction net revenues are derived from a relatively concentrated customer base 
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december  our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled million 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of our reportable units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of august  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required 
we have determined that no events have occurred from that date through december  that would require an updated analysis 

table of contents risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include the following our ability to retain an active user base  to attract new users  and to encourage existing users to list items for sale  purchase items through our service  or use our payment services  the volume  size  timing  and completion rate of transactions on our websites  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses  operations  and infrastructure  technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to our users by third parties  the success of our geographic and product expansions  the actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new sites  services  and products  consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our websites  the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising  and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  new laws or regulations  or interpretations of existing laws or regulations  that harm the internet  electronic commerce  or our business model  our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations  such as credit card associations  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems  infrastructure  and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth at a reasonable cost  the costs and results of litigation that involves us  our ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost  our ability to develop product enhancements at a reasonable cost and to develop programs and features in a timely manner  including expanding our fixed price offerings  our ability to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions  including  most recently  rent 
com  our ability to manage paypal s transaction loss and credit card chargeback rate and payment funding mix  our ability to expand paypal s product offerings outside of the us including our ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and to increase the acceptance of paypal by online merchants outside of the ebay marketplace  our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner and to retain key employees  the results of regulatory decisions that affect us  the continued financial strength of our technology suppliers and other parties with whom we have commercial relations  
table of contents increasing consumer acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce in the face of increasing publicity about fraud  spoofing  viruses  and other dangers of the internet  general economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to the internet and e commerce industries  and geopolitical events such as war  threat of war  or terrorist actions 
our limited operating history and the increased variety of services offered on our websites make it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we may not maintain our level of profitability or rates of growth 
we believe that our continued profitability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to do the following attract new users and keep existing users active on our websites  manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites  customer support  transaction and chargeback rates  and international and product expansion  maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers  increase the awareness of our brands  and provide our customers with superior community  customer support  and trading experiences 
we invest heavily in marketing and promotion  customer support  and further development of operating infrastructure for our core and recently acquired operations 
some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
in addition  we are spending in advance of anticipated growth  which may also harm our profitability 
growth rates in our most established markets  such as germany and the us  have declined over time and may continue to do so as the existing base of users and transactions becomes larger 
the expected future growth of our paypal business may also cause downward pressure on our profit margin because that business has lower gross margins than our ebay business 
system failures could harm our business 
we have experienced system failures from time to time  and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current revenues and profits  could harm our future revenues and profits  and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
ebay s primary website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours  and our paypal site suffered intermittent unavailability over a five day period in october any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
these interruptions increase the burden on our engineering staff  which  in turn  could delay our introduction of new features and services on our sites 
because paypal is a regulated financial entity  frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory inquiries 
these inquiries 
table of contents could result in fines  penalties  or mandatory changes to paypal s business practices  and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events 
some of our systems  including paypal s customer support operations  are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
in addition  the failure by our hosting facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands  and these efforts may be costly 
our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth  and to frequent and high visibility national and local media coverage 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services  and will require an increased focus on active marketing efforts 
the demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing  and may continue to increase 
accordingly  we will need to spend increasing amounts of money on  and devote greater resources to  advertising  marketing  and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands 
if we do attract new users to our services  they may not conduct transactions over our services on a regular basis 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands  or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands  our business would be harmed 
we depend on the continued growth of online commerce 
the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through online trading  is dynamic and relatively new 
growth in the use of the internet as a medium for consumer commerce may not continue 
concerns about fraud  privacy  and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet as a medium of commerce 
market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet is highly uncertain  and there are few proven services and products 
in countries such as the us  where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time  acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive 
our competitive arena is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
these characteristics are caused in part by the emerging and changing nature of the internet 
our future success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards and to improve the performance  features  and reliability of our service 
our failure to adapt to such changes 
table of contents would harm our business 
recent changes in search functionality  including both paid and natural search  may give buyers easier access to internet sellers who do not use our trading platforms and may provide such sellers with alternative access to buyers 
these developments may reduce the attractiveness of our platform to sellers and may adversely affect our growth and business 
new technologies  such as the development of a peer to peer personal trading technology  could also adversely affect us 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet  networking  or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
there are many risks associated with our international operations 
our international expansion has been rapid and we have only limited experience in many of the countries in which we now do business 
our international business  especially in germany  the uk  canada  and south korea  has also become critical to our revenues and profits 
in  our international net transaction revenues represented of our total net transaction revenues 
expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources 
we have limited experience in localizing our service to conform to local cultures  standards  and policies 
the commercial  internet  and transportation infrastructure in lesser developed countries may make it difficult for us to replicate our business model 
in many countries  we compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do  and we may not benefit from first to market advantages 
we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
for example  in we withdrew from the japanese market 
even if we are successful  we expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  including through the expansion of paypal  we are subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following regulatory requirements  including regulation of auctioneering  professional selling  distance selling  banking  and money transmitting  that may limit or prevent the offering of ebay s and paypal s services in some jurisdictions  prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers  prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods  require special licensure  or limit the transfer of information between ebay and our affiliates  legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users  including uncertainty as a result of less internet friendly legal systems  unique local laws  and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  difficulties in integrating with local payment providers  including banks  credit and debit card associations  and electronic fund transfer systems  differing levels of retail distribution  shipping  and communications infrastructures  different employee employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites  higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs  strong local competitors  different and more stringent consumer protection  data protection and other laws  cultural ambivalence towards  or non acceptance of  online trading  seasonal reductions in business activity  
table of contents expenses associated with localizing our products  including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency  laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses  profit repatriation restrictions  foreign currency exchange restrictions  and exchange rate fluctuations  volatility in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  and differing intellectual property laws 
some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs 
as we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  below 
we are in the process of expanding paypal s services internationally 
both ebay and paypal have limited experience with the payments business outside of the us in some countries  expansion of paypal s business may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks 
we do not know if these or other factors may prevent  delay  or limit paypal s expansion or reduce its profitability 
any limitation on our ability to expand paypal internationally could harm our business 
our operations in china are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of the people s republic of china 
in july  we completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding capital stock and options of eachnet 
eachnet is a delaware corporation and a foreign person under the laws of the people s republic of china  or prc  and is subject to many of the risks of doing business internationally described above in there are many risks associated with our international operations 
the prc currently regulates its internet sector through regulations restricting the scope of foreign investment and through the enforcement of content restrictions on the internet 
while many aspects of these regulations remain unclear  they purport to limit and require licensing of various aspects of the provision of internet information services 
these regulations have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of foreign investments in prc internet companies  including eachnet  and the business operations of such companies 
in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements  the new ebay eachnet website is operated through a foreign owned enterprise indirectly owned by ebay s european operating entity  which acts in cooperation with a local prc company owned by certain local employees 
we believe eachnet s current ownership structure complies with all existing prc laws  rules  and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of current prc laws and regulations  and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours 
there are also uncertainties regarding eachnet s ability to enforce contractual relationships it has entered into with respect to management and control of the company s business 
if eachnet were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations  it could be subject to fines and other financial penalties  have its business and internet content provider licenses revoked  or be forced to discontinue its business entirely 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
net revenues outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues in because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states but report our results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
in connection with its multi currency service  paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day  and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate 
paypal also holds some corporate funds in non us currencies to facilitate customer withdrawals  and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non us currencies into non us dollars 
in addition  the results of operations of our internationally focused websites are exposed to 
table of contents foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  as it did in  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income 
the change in weighted average foreign currency exchange rates in relative to the comparable rates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements resulted in an increase in net revenues of approximately million and an increase in aggregate cost of revenues and operating expenses of approximately million 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses  and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in particular  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro and british pound  our european revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments 
in addition  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro and the british pound  cross border trade related to purchases of dollar denominated goods by non us purchasers may decrease  and that decrease may not be offset by a corresponding increase in cross border trade involving purchases by us buyers of goods denominated in other currencies 
while we from time to time enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  these hedges are relatively costly and  even with them in effect  it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes 
the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax  value added tax  or vat  goods and services tax  business tax  and gross receipt tax to e commerce businesses such as ebay and our users is a complex and evolving issue 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and e commerce 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or e commerce 
in addition  some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of e commerce 
the application of existing  new  or future laws could have adverse effects on our business 
several proposals have been made at the us state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of e commerce  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
in december  the us federal government enacted legislation extending the moratorium on states and other local authorities imposing access or discriminatory taxes on the internet through november this moratorium does not prohibit federal  state  or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules 
in conjunction with the streamlined sales tax project  the us congress continues to consider overriding the supreme court s quill decision  which limits the ability of state governments to require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents 
an overturning of the quill decision would harm our users and our business 
we do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services 
one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection or reporting  or record keeping obligation on companies such as ebay that engage in or facilitate e commerce 
such an obligation could be imposed if ebay were ever deemed to be the legal agent of ebay sellers by a jurisdiction in which ebay operates 
a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect taxes on the exchange of merchandise or services on our websites would harm our business 
in july  in compliance with the changes brought about by the european union eu vat directive on electronically supplied services  ebay began collecting vat on the fees charged to eu sellers on ebay sites catering to eu residents 
ebay also pays input vat to suppliers within the various countries the company operates 
in most cases  ebay is entitled to reclaim input vat from the various countries with regard to our own payments to suppliers or vendors 
however  because of our unique business model  the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain 
a successful assertion by one or more countries that ebay is not entitled to reclaim vat would harm our business 

table of contents we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify ebay s obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations 
passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax requirements could harm ebay sellers and our business 
there have been  and will continue to be  substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which ebay conducts or will conduct business 
fraudulent activities on our websites and disputes between users of our services may harm our business 
paypal faces significant risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between senders and recipients  including merchant fraud and other disputes over the quality of goods and services  unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft  the need to provide effective customer support to process disputes between senders and recipients  potential breaches of system security  potential employee fraud  and use of paypal s system by customers to make or accept payment for illegal or improper purposes 
for the year ended december   paypal s transaction loss expense totaled million  representing of paypal s total payment volume 
failure to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer disputes would increase paypal s loss rate and harm its business 
paypal s highly automated and liquid payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud 
in configuring its service  paypal faces an inherent trade off between customer convenience and security 
identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal 
we believe that several of paypal s current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud 
we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypal s anti fraud systems 
in addition  paypal s service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches  and paypal would be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches 
paypal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud  including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant s description 
paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase  from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments 
in addition to the direct costs of such losses  if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive they could result in paypal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease  in which case our business would further suffer 
paypal has been assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks in the past  and excessive chargebacks may arise in the future 
paypal has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud  but these measures may not be effective 
if these measures do not succeed  our business will suffer 
in october  paypal launched a buyer protection program that refunds to buyers up to in certain ebay transactions if they do not receive the goods they purchased or if the goods differ significantly from what was described by the seller 
in november  paypal increased the amount of protection available under its buyer protection program to  if paypal makes such a refund  it seeks to collect reimbursement from the seller  but may not be able to receive any funds from the seller 
the paypal buyer protection program has increased paypal s loss rate and could cause future fluctuations 
ebay faces similar risks to those of paypal with respect to fraudulent activities  although ebay s risks may to some extent be less significant 
ebay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased 
in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites 
ebay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase 
non payment may occur because of miscommunication  because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item  or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously  in order to harm either the seller or ebay 
in some european 
table of contents jurisdictions  buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period 
while ebay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users  ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods  or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs 
other than through these programs  ebay does not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users 
ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in some non us jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation involving liability for third party actions could be costly for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us  including imposing fines or seeking injunctions 
negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our ebay and paypal services could damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users  and diminish the value of our brand names 
changes to credit card association fees  rules  or practices or its users credit card usage rates could negatively affect paypal s business 
because paypal is not a bank  it cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations  such as visa and mastercard 
as a result  paypal must rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions  and must pay a fee for this service 
from time to time  credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards 
mastercard has announced an increase in the standard interchange fee for credit cards in online commerce transactions effective april paypal s credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing 
such increased fees increase paypal s operating costs and reduce its profit margins 
paypal is also required by its processors to comply with credit card association operating rules  and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by credit card associations as a result of processing payments for paypal 
the credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret the credit card rules 
some of those member banks compete with paypal 
visa  mastercard  american express  or discover could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow 
as a result  paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  its business would be seriously damaged 
in addition  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and our business would further suffer 
in  both visa and mastercard adopted new operating rules for internet payment services like paypal 
in order to comply with the associations new rules  paypal and its credit card processors have implemented changes to existing business processes for merchant customers 
any problems with this implementation could result in fines  the amount of which would be within visa s and mastercard s discretion 
paypal also could be subject to fines from mastercard and visa if it fails to register and conduct additional monitoring with respect to the activities of merchants that are considered high risk  primarily certain merchants that sell digital content 
paypal has incurred fines from its credit card processor in and relating to paypal s failure to detect the use of its service by certain high risk merchants using the paypal service 
the amount of these fines has not been material  but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts  could become material  and could result in a termination of paypal s ability to accept credit cards  which would seriously damage paypal s business 
paypal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards  nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts  and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance 
senders funded of paypal s payment volume during using credit cards  and paypal s financial success will 
table of contents remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards 
senders may prefer funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons  including the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described  the ability to earn frequent flier miles or other incentives offered by credit cards  the ability to defer payment  or a reluctance to provide bank account information to paypal 
if paypal were found to be subject to or in violation of any us laws or regulations governing banking  money transmission  or electronic funds transfers  it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices 
we believe that the licensing or approval requirements of the us office of the comptroller of the currency  the federal reserve board  and other federal or state agencies that regulate banks  bank holding companies  or other types of providers of e commerce services do not apply to paypal  except for certain money transmitter licenses mentioned below 
however  paypal has in the past received written communications from state regulatory authorities expressing the view that its service might constitute an unauthorized banking business 
paypal has taken steps to address these states concerns 
however  we cannot guarantee that the steps paypal has taken to address these regulatory concerns will be effective in all states  and one or more states may conclude that paypal is engaged in an unauthorized banking business 
if paypal is found to be engaged in an unauthorized banking business in one or more states  it might be subject to monetary penalties and adverse publicity and might be required to cease doing business with residents of those states 
even if the steps it has taken to resolve these states concerns are deemed sufficient by the state regulatory authorities  paypal could be subject to fines and penalties for its prior activities 
the need to comply with state laws prohibiting unauthorized banking activities could also limit paypal s ability to enhance its services in the future 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
a number of us states have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters 
to date  paypal has obtained licenses in of these jurisdictions and interpretations in nine states that licensing is not required under their existing statutes 
as a licensed money transmitter  paypal is subject to bonding requirements  restrictions on its investment of customer funds  reporting requirements  and inspection by state regulatory agencies 
if paypal s pending applications were denied  or if it were found to be subject to and in violation of any money services laws or regulations  paypal also could be subject to liability  forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states  or forced to change its business practices 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
even if paypal is not forced to change its business practices  it could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on paypal 
although there have been no definitive interpretations to date  paypal has assumed that its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the federal reserve board 
as a result  among other things  paypal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service  follow specified error resolution procedures and absorb losses above from transactions not authorized by the consumer 
in addition  paypal is subject to the financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act  state financial privacy laws  and related regulations 
as a result  some customer financial information that paypal receives is subject to limitations on reuse and disclosure 
existing and potential future privacy laws may limit paypal s ability to develop new products and services that make use of data gathered through its service 
the provisions of these laws and related regulations are complicated  and paypal does not have extensive experience in complying with them 
even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to  for each non compliant transaction 
paypal processed an average of approximately  transactions per day during  and any violations could expose paypal to significant liability 

table of contents paypal s status under banking or financial services laws or other laws in countries outside the us is unclear 
paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from countries outside the us  and to receive payments in of those countries 
in of these countries  customers can withdraw funds to local bank accounts  and in eight of these countries customers can withdraw funds by receiving a bank draft in the mail 
paypal offers customers the ability to send or receive payments denominated in us dollars  british pounds  euros  canadian dollars  yen  and  beginning in january  australian dollars 
paypal has applied for an australian financial services license  and has received an official exemption from the banking act in australia until october in february  paypal europe ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal  received a license to operate as an electronic money institution in the united kingdom as a vehicle for providing localized versions of paypal s service to customers in the eu 
fifteen of the countries outside of the us whose residents can use the paypal service are members of the european union 
as paypal europe develops localized services for the domestic market in these countries  it is implementing such localized services through an expedited passport notification process through the uk regulator to regulators in other eu member states  pursuant to eu directives 
paypal europe has filed passport notices in austria  belgium  france  germany  the netherlands  ireland  italy  sweden  denmark  finland  luxembourg  portugal  greece and spain 
the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its business  in addition to uk consumer protection law 
any such responses from these regulators could increase the cost of  or delay  paypal s plans for expanding its business 
paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  funds management or other requirements imposed on electronic money institutions 
in many countries outside of the us and the european union  it is not clear whether paypal s us based service is subject to local law or  if it is subject to local law  whether such local law requires a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise 
even if paypal is not currently required to obtain a license in those countries  future localization or targeted marketing of paypal s service in those countries could require licensure and other laws of those countries such as data protection laws may apply 
if paypal were found to be subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or regulations  it could be subject to liability  forced to change its business practices or forced to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries 
alternatively  paypal could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its product 
delay or failure to receive such a license would require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypal s international expansion plans and could require paypal to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries 
we are subject to regulations relating to consumer privacy 
several domestic jurisdictions have proposed  and california  minnesota  utah  and vermont have recently passed  legislation that limits the uses of personal information gathered online or offline 
in addition to these four states  many other jurisdictions already have such laws and continuously consider strengthening them  especially against online services 
ebay and paypal in certain instances are subject to some of these current laws 
paypal may also be subject to recently enacted legislation in several states and countries imposing greater restrictions on the ability of financial services companies to share user information with third parties without affirmative user consent 
however  the fair and accurate credit transactions act of  or fact  included a provision preempting conflicting state laws on the sharing of information between corporate affiliates  and as a result we believe that paypal and ebay will not be subject to the laws of each individual state with respect to matters within the scope of fact  but will remain subject to the provisions of fact and the fair credit reporting act 
courts are currently determining the scope of these preemptive provisions 
specific statutes intended to protect user privacy have been passed in many non us jurisdictions  including virtually every non us jurisdiction in which we currently have a localized website 
compliance with these laws  given the tight integration of our systems across different countries and the need to move data to facilitate transactions amongst our users eg  to payment companies  shipping companies  etc  is both 
table of contents necessary and difficult 
failure to comply could subject us to lawsuits  fines  criminal penalties  statutory damages  adverse publicity  and other losses that could harm our business 
changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws intended to address these privacy and data protection and retention issues could directly affect the way we do business or could create uncertainty on the internet 
this could reduce demand for our services  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service or delivery costs  or otherwise harm our business 
new and existing regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet 
today  there are still relatively few laws specifically directed towards online services 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services  many laws relating to the internet are being debated at all levels of government around the world and it is possible that such laws and regulations will be adopted 
these laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  fraud  content and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  and information security 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity  and personal privacy apply to online businesses 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the us digital millennium copyright act and the european union s directive on distance selling and electronic commerce have begun to be interpreted by the courts and implemented by the eu member states  but their applicability and scope remain somewhat uncertain 
as our activities and the types of goods listed on our website expand  regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction  either with respect to our services in general  or in order to allow the sale of certain items eg  real estate  event tickets  cultural goods  boats  automobiles 
numerous states and foreign jurisdictions  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by pawnbrokers 
no final legal determination has been made as to whether the california regulations apply to our business and little precedent exists in this area 
several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted  and may attempt in the future  to impose such regulations upon us or our users  which could harm our business 
in august  illinois amended its auction law to provide for a special regulatory regime for internet auction listing services  and we have registered as an internet auction listing service in illinois 
although we do not expect this registration to have a negative impact on our business  other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties  and any of these outcomes could harm our business 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws 
for example  the australian high court has ruled that a us website in certain circumstances must comply with australian laws regarding libel 
as we expand and localize our international activities  we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
laws regulating internet companies outside of the us may be less favorable than those in the us  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners  and users 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings relative to those in the us our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our services 
paypal has limited experience in managing and accounting accurately for large amounts of customer funds 
paypal s failure to manage these funds properly would harm its business 
paypal s ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls 
paypal has neither an established operating history nor proven management experience in maintain 
table of contents ing  over a long term  these internal controls 
as paypal s business continues to grow  it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly 
paypal s success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds 
any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of paypal s product severely 
our business is subject to online commerce security risks  including security breaches and identity theft 
to succeed  online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches that could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
paypal s users routinely provide credit card and other financial information 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data 
in addition  any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user s password could access the user s transaction data 
a number of websites have reported breaches of their security 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business 
in addition  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  or cause interruptions in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 
our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  and similar disruptions  and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
our users  as well as those of other prominent internet companies  have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent emails to misappropriate passwords  credit card numbers  or other personal information 
these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay or paypal  but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email 
we actively pursue the parties responsible for these attempts at misappropriation and encourage our users to divulge sensitive information only after they have verified that they are on our legitimate websites  but we cannot entirely eliminate these types of activities 
our failure to manage growth could harm our business 
we are currently expanding our headcount  facilities  and infrastructure in the us and internationally 
we anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and number of listings and payment transactions  as well as our expansion into new geographic areas  types of goods  and alternative methods of sale 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational  and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following our websites 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we regularly introduce 
this upgrade process is expensive  and the increased complexity of our websites increases the cost of additional enhancements 
failure to upgrade our technology  features  transaction processing systems  security infrastructure  or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business 
adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of users experiences of our services  impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible application programming interface  or 
table of contents api  and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems  and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites 
for example  in october  we experienced unscheduled downtime on the paypal website related to system upgrades 
despite our efforts to increase site scalability and reliability  our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a larger volume of customer transactions 
any failure to accommodate transaction growth could impair customer satisfaction  lead to a loss of customers  impair our ability to add customers  or increase our costs  all of which would harm our business 
further  steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive  reduce our margins  and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
customer account billing 
our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes 
we recently completed a significant project to enhance our billing software 
problems with the conversion to the new billing system during the second and third quarters of caused incorrect account balance totals to be displayed for some users 
in july  a complaint seeking class action status was filed alleging that ebay improperly billed its users and improperly debited some user accounts 
the complaint was recently amended to include a larger variety of billing related problems and a longer time frame 
while these problems have been corrected and we believe that no users were overcharged  our failure to grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue 
customer support 
we are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our websites and the increased level of trust and safety activity we provide worldwide 
if we are unable to provide these operations in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  current and future revenues could suffer  and our operating margins may decrease 
we must continue to hire  train  and manage new employees at a rapid rate 
if our new hires perform poorly  if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing  and integrating these new employees  or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls 
this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding increase our cost base  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term 
our business is adversely affected by anything that causes our users to spend less time on their computers  including seasonal factors and national events 
anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business 
we would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war  the threat of war  or terrorist activity  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes or earthquakes 
similarly  our results of operations historically have been seasonal because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months  and on and around national holidays 
we have historically experienced our strongest quarters of online growth in our first and fourth fiscal quarters 
paypal has shown similar seasonality  especially in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we expect these patterns of seasonality to become more pronounced as our websites gain acceptance by a broader base of mainstream users and as the size of our european operations  which experience greater seasonality  grows relative to our other operations 
use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is currently unsettled in the united states and internationally 
we are aware that certain goods  such as weapons  adult material  tobacco products  alcohol  and other goods that may be subject to regulation  have 
table of contents been listed and traded on our service 
we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful goods or selling goods in an unlawful manner  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
in december  an executive of baazee 
com  our indian subsidiary  was arrested in connection with the listing of a pornographic video clip on that site 
similarly  our korean subsidiary and one of its employees was found criminally liable for a listing on the korean subsidiary s website 
in order to reduce our exposure to this liability  we have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number of personnel reviewing questionable items 
in the future  we may implement other protective measures that could require us to spend substantial resources or discontinue certain service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business 
in addition  we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods using our services 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand names 
it also could make users reluctant to continue to use our services 
paypal s payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  piracy of software and other intellectual property  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products  and online securities fraud 
paypal recently announced a change in its acceptable use policy that would enable paypal to fine users in certain jurisdictions up to or take legal action to recover its losses for certain violations of that policy  including online gambling and illegal sales of prescription medications 
despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  illegal activities may be funded using paypal 
paypal is subject to money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit  among other things  its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities 
although paypal has adopted a program to comply with these laws and regulations  any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits  administrative action  and prosecution by the government 
in july  paypal agreed with the us attorney for the eastern district of missouri that it would pay million as a civil forfeiture to settle allegations that its provision of services to online gambling merchants violated provisions of the usa patriot act and further agreed to have its compliance program reviewed by an independent audit firm 
paypal is also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of  or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of  or more 
the interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain 
future regulations under the usa patriot act may require paypal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor more closely international transactions 
these regulations could impose significant costs on paypal and make it more difficult for new customers to join its network 
paypal could be required to learn more about its customers before opening an account  to obtain additional verification of international customers and to monitor its customers activities more closely 
these requirements  as well as any additional restrictions imposed by visa  mastercard  american express  and discover  could raise paypal s costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of its product 
failure to comply with federal and state money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits  penalties  and forfeiture of significant assets 
we are subject to intellectual property and other litigation 
in april  two of our european subsidiaries  ebay gmbh and ebay international ag  were sued by montres rolex sa and certain of its affiliates in the regional court of cologne  germany 
the suit subsequently was transferred to the regional court in d sseldorf  germany 
rolex alleged that our subsidiaries were infringing rolex s trademarks as a result of users selling counterfeit rolex watches through our german website 
the suit also alleged unfair competition 
rolex sought an order enjoining the sale of rolex branded watches on the website as well as damages 
in december  a trial was held in the matter and the court ruled in favor of ebay on all causes of action 
rolex appealed the ruling to the higher regional court of d sseldorf  and the appeal was heard in october in february  the court rejected rolex s appeal and ruled in our favor 
rolex has appealed the ruling to the german federal supreme court 
in march  
table of contents the german federal supreme court ruled in favor of rolex in a case involving an unrelated company  ricardo 
de ag  but somewhat comparable legal theories 
the court issued its written decision in that case in september although it is not yet clear what effect the reasoning of the german federal supreme court s ricardo 
de decision would have when applied to ebay  we believe the court s decision will likely not require any significant change in our business practices 
in september  a complaint was filed by mercexchange llc against us  our half 
com subsidiary and returnbuy  inc in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia no 
cv alleging infringement of three patents relating to online auction technology  multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems and seeking a permanent injunction and damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
in october  the court granted in part our summary judgment motion  effectively invalidating the patent related to online auction technology and rendering it unenforceable 
this ruling left only two patents in the case 
trial of the matter began in april in may  the jury returned a verdict finding that ebay had willfully infringed one and half 
com had willfully infringed both of the patents in the suit  awarding million in compensatory damages 
both parties filed post trial motions  and in august  the court entered judgment for mercexchange in the amount of million  plus pre judgment interest and post judgment interest in an amount to be determined  while denying mercexchange s request for an injunction and attorneys fees 
we appealed the verdict and judgment in favor of mercexchange  and mercexchange filed a cross appeal of the granting in part of our summary judgment motion and the denial of its request for an injunction and attorneys fees 
oral arguments for the appeals were heard on october  the us patent and trademark office recently granted our request that it reexamine the three patents at suit  and on january   the patent and trademark office issued a ruling rejecting all of mercexchange s claims under the patent that related to online auctions 
we continue to believe that the verdict against us in the trial was incorrect and intend to continue to pursue our appeal and defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our appeal of and defense against this action will continue to be costly 
in addition  as a precautionary measure  we have modified certain functionality of our websites and business practices in a manner which we believe makes them not infringe the two patents that we were found to have infringed 
nonetheless  if we are not successful in appealing the court s ruling  we might be forced to pay significant additional damages and licensing fees or modify our business practices in an adverse manner 
in august  charles e 
hill associates  inc filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the eastern district of texas no 
cv alleging that we and other companies  primarily large retailers  infringed three patents owned by hill generally relating to electronic catalog systems and methods for transmitting and updating data at a remote computer 
the suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement  unspecified damages  including treble damages for willful infringement  and interest  costs  expenses  and fees 
in january  the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of indiana 
after pending in indiana for almost a year  the case was transferred back to the us district court for the eastern district of texas in december a scheduling conference was held in november  and a preliminary trial date has been set for february the case is currently in fact discovery and claim construction discovery 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
in february  paypal was sued in california state court no 
cv in a purported class action alleging that its restriction of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates california state consumer protection laws and is an unfair business practice and a breach of paypal s user agreement 
this action was re filed with a different named plaintiff in june no 
cv  and a similar action was also filed in the us district court for the northern district of california in june no 
c 
in march  paypal was sued in the us district court for the northern district of california no 
c in a purported class action alleging that its restrictions of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates federal and state consumer protection and unfair business practice laws 
the two federal court actions were consolidated into a single case  and the state court action was stayed pending developments in the federal case 
in june  the parties announced that they had reached a proposed settlement 
the settlement received approval from the federal court on november   but the court s approval could be appealed 
in the settlement  paypal does not acknowledge that any of the 
table of contents allegations in the case are true 
under the terms of the settlement  certain paypal account holders will be eligible to receive payment from a settlement fund of million  less administrative costs and the amount awarded to plaintiffs counsel by the court 
that sum will be distributed to class members who have submitted timely claims in accordance with the settlement s plan of allocation  which still must be approved by the court 
the parties expect that a plan of allocation will be submitted to the court in the first quarter of the amount of the settlement was fully accrued in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in july  a purported class action lawsuit was filed by two ebay users in superior court of the state of california  county of santa clara no 
cv alleging that ebay engaged in improper billing practices as the result of problems with the rollout of a new billing software system in the second and third quarters of the lawsuit sought damages and injunctive relief 
an amended complaint was filed in january  dropping one plaintiff  changing the capacity of the other plaintiff to that of representative plaintiff  and adding seven additional ebay users as plaintiffs 
the amended complaint expanded its claim to include numerous alleged improper billing practices from september until the present 
in february  ebay filed a motion to strike and a demurrer seeking to dismiss the complaint 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
in february  ebay was sued in superior court of the state of california  county of santa clara no 
cv in a purported class action alleging that certain bidding features of our site constitute shill bidding for the purpose of artificially inflating bids placed by buyers on the site 
the complaint alleges violations of california s auction act  california s consumer remedies act  and unfair competition 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief  damages  and a constructive trust 
the plaintiffs have not yet served ebay with the complaint 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
other third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we have been notified of several potential patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity 
in particular  we expect to face additional patent infringement claims involving services we provide  including various aspects of our payments business 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
these claims  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming and costly to resolve  cause service upgrade delays  require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes is increasing as our business expands and our company grows larger 
any claims against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties 
in january  we received initial requests to produce certain records and information to the federal government relating to an investigation of possible illegal transactions in connection with our websites 
we were informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our practices with respect to these transactions 
in order to protect the investigation  the court has ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect to the matter 
any civil or criminal charges against us would likely harm our business due to negative publicity  the cost of litigation  the diversion of management time  and any fines or penalties assessed 
a large number of transactions occur on our websites 
we believe that government regulators have received a substantial number of consumer complaints about both ebay and paypal  which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  we have from time to time been contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
paypal has received inquiries regarding 
table of contents its restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and the attorneys general of a number of states 
if paypal s processes are found to violate federal or state law on consumer protection and unfair business practices  it could be subject to an enforcement action or fines 
if paypal becomes subject to an enforcement action  it could be required to restructure its anti fraud processes in ways that would harm its business  and to pay substantial fines 
even if paypal is able to defend itself successfully  an enforcement action could cause damage to its reputation  could consume substantial amounts of its management s time and attention  and could require paypal to change its customer service and operations in ways that could increase its costs and decrease the effectiveness of its anti fraud program 
both ebay and paypal are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  which may lead to action against either company 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts  customer support procedures and operating procedures 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  we could be subject to fines or other penalties  or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business 
we are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users  especially users located outside of the us violation of these laws  which in many cases apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries  and between ourselves  our subsidiaries  and other parties with which we have commercial relations  could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and could adversely affect us 
the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business 
we have received in the past  and we anticipate receiving in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and trade names  or other intellectual property rights 
although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites  some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies  including ebay 
allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in litigation against us from time to time  including litigation brought by tiffany co 
in the us  rolex us in germany  and a number of other owners of intellectual property rights 
while we have been largely successful to date in defending against such litigation  more recent cases have been based  at least in part  on different legal theories than those of earlier cases  and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in our defense 
in addition  we expect that this type of litigation may increase as our sites gain prominence in markets outside of the us  where the laws may be unsettled or less favorable to us 
such litigation is costly for us  could result in damage awards or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  or could otherwise harm our business 
litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon us under a number of these theories have been brought against us 
in addition  domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for content posted in the feedback forum 
several recent court decisions have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to internet service providers like us under the communications decency act 
this trend  if continued  may increase our potential liability to third parties for 
table of contents the user provided content on our site 
our liability for such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled 
if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business 
any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could diminish use of our services 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services 
breaches of our customers privacy and our security measures could have the same effect 
measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers 
these measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes 
effective customer service requires significant personnel expense  and this expense  if not managed properly  could impact our profitability significantly 
failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively 
if we do not handle customer complaints effectively  our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence 
because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment  paypal  unlike ebay  must provide telephone as well as email customer service and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames 
as part of paypal s program to reduce fraud losses  it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customer s account activity are identified by paypal s anti fraud models as suspicious 
paypal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer service and account restrictions  and is the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging  among other things  failure to resolve account restrictions promptly 
if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner  paypal s users may have negative experiences  paypal may receive additional negative publicity and its ability to attract new customers may be damaged 
current and future revenues could suffer  or its operating margins may decrease 
in addition  negative publicity about or experiences with paypal s customer support could cause ebay s reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in ebay as a whole 
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties  dilution and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired a number of businesses in the past  and have recently completed or announced the acquisitions of marktplaats 
nl  a classified listing site in the netherlands  and rent 
com  an internet classified site focused on the apartment and rental housing industry 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions 
any of such transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  
table of contents the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  and in some cases  the need to transition operations onto the existing ebay platform 
foreign acquisitions involve special risks  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks  and the particular economic  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions 
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers  we might need to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
our stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be extremely volatile and could fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results and expected future results  changes in  or failure to meet  financial estimates by securities analysts  unscheduled system downtime  additions or departures of key personnel  announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  initiation of or developments in litigation affecting us  conditions or trends in the internet and online commerce industries  changes in the market valuations of other internet  online commerce  or technology companies  developments in regulation  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  new products or capital commitments  unanticipated economic or political events  sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market  and other events or factors  including those described in this risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition section and others that may be beyond our control 
the trading prices of internet stocks in general  and ours in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent periods 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
even considering recent changes  the valuation of our stock remains high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios 
the trading price of our common stock has decreased sharply from its level in the fourth quarter in  but remains much higher than our stock price during and early this trading price and valuation may not be sustained 
negative changes in the public s perception of the prospects of internet or e commerce or technology companies have in the past and may in the future depress our stock price regardless of our results 
other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  also may decrease the market price of our common stock 
securities class action litigation is often instituted following declines in the market price of a company s securities 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 

table of contents problems with third parties who provide services to our users could harm our business 
a number of parties provide services to our users that indirectly benefit us 
such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings  merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software  storefronts that help our users list items  and other services 
in some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success  while in other cases we have none 
in either circumstance  financial  regulatory  or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions on our websites more difficult  and thereby harm our business 
any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business 
although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service providers on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
other companies or governmental agencies may view our behavior as anti competitive 
other companies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us or other countries  or otherwise constitute unfair competition 
such claims typically are very expensive to defend  involve negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort  and could result in significant judgments against us 
we provided information to the antitrust division of the us department of justice in connection with an inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction aggregators  including our licensing program and a previously settled lawsuit against bidder s edge 
although the antitrust division has closed this inquiry  any future antitrust investigation would likely harm our business due to negative publicity  the costs of the investigation  possible private antitrust lawsuits  the diversion of management time and effort  and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not to prevail 
we depend on key personnel 
our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel  we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies  and our chief executive officer has fully vested the vast majority of her equity incentives 
our new businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate  or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
similarly  decreases in the number of unvested stock options held by existing employees  either because their options have vested or because the size of follow on option grants has declined  may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees 
our industry is intensely competitive 
we currently or potentially compete with a number of companies providing both particular categories of goods and broader ranges of goods 
the internet provides new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low  and current offline and new competitors can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful e commerce companies 
our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department  warehouse  discount  and general merchandise stores  emerging online retailers  online classified services  and other shopping 
table of contents channels such as offline and online home shopping networks 
these include most prominently wal mart  kmart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  costco  office depot  staples  officemax  sam s club  amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol 
com  yahoo shopping  msn  qvc  and home shopping network 
a number of companies have launched a variety of services that provide new channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes 
for example  sites such as buy 
com  dealtime  google s froogle  in store 
com  mysimon 
com  nextag 
com  pricegrabber 
com  shopping 
com  and yahoo product search offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products 
similarly  sellers are increasingly acquiring new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites such as google and yahoo 
we use product search engines and paid search advertising to channel users to our sites  but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations 
we also face competition from local  regional  and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of our categories of products 
many competitors have been successful at establishing marketplaces that cater to a particular retail category  such as vehicles  tickets  or sporting goods 
examples of category specific competitors include books movies music abebooks

our international websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries 
in addition  they compete with general online e commerce sites  such as quelle and otto in germany  yahoo kimo in taiwan  daum in south korea  taobao and pai  a partnership between sina 
com and yahoo in china  and amazon in the uk and other countries 
in some of these countries  there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do  and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do 
the principal competitive factors for ebay include the following ability to attract buyers and sellers  volume of transactions and price and selection of goods  customer service  and brand recognition 
with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include community cohesion  interaction and size  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  website convenience and accessibility  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
some current and potential competitors have longer company operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do 
some of these competitors also have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
other online trading services may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can 
some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as well 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  certain offline competitors may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as ebay  or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services 
the adoption by manufacturers or government authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of goods or services over the internet could force ebay users to stop selling certain products on our websites 
increased competition or anti internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brand 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our profitability 
for example  we have implemented a buyer protection program that generally insures items up to a value of  with a deductible  for users with a non negative feedback rating at no cost to the user 
paypal has implemented a similar buyer protection program covering losses from selected ebay sellers up to  with no deductible 
depending on the amount and size of claims we receive under these programs  these product offerings could harm our profitability 
in addition  certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other 
table of contents transaction related services  which could be impractical or inefficient for ebay users to match 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our services 
in addition  companies that control user access to transactions through network access  internet browsers  or search engines  could promote our competitors  channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites  attempt to restrict our access  or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
the market for paypal s product is emerging  intensely competitive  and characterized by rapid technological change 
paypal competes with existing online and off line payment methods  including  among others credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants  including card services international  chase  first data  ipayment  paymentech  and wells fargo  and payment gateways  including cybersource  verisign  and authorize 
net  bidpay 
com and western union moneyzap  each operated by subsidiaries of first data  payment services offered by amazon 
com  checkfree  processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account  including certegy and telecheck  a subsidiary of first data  or to pay on credit  including bill me later from i commerce and cit bank  providers of traditional payment methods  particularly credit cards  checks  money orders  and automated clearing house transactions  and issuers of stored value targeted at online payments  including visabuxx 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition  or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than paypal 
paypal s competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal 
they may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of products and services than paypal  and they may offer lower prices 
some of these competitors have offered  and may continue to offer  their services for free in order to gain market share  and paypal may be forced to lower its prices in response 
competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal 
if these competitors acquired significant market share  this could result in paypal losing market share 
overseas  paypal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods in most countries and from regional and national online and offline competitors in each country including visa s visa direct  mastercard s moneysend  ing s waypay and royal bank of scotland s world pay in the european community  nochex  moneybookers  and royal bank of scotland s fastpay in the uk  certapay and hyperwallet in canada  paymate in australia  alipay in china and inicis in south korea 
in addition  in certain countries  such as germany and australia  electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions 
as in the us  established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our service will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable 
table of contents internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  increasing numbers of users  increasing bandwidth requirements  or problems caused by viruses  worms  and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the level of traffic and the processing transactions on our service 
we need to develop new services  features  and functions in order to expand 
we plan to expand our operations by developing new or complementary services  products  or transaction formats and expanding the breadth and depth of our pre trade and post trade services 
we may be unable to expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner 
we are pursuing strategic relationships with other companies to provide many of these services 
as a result  we may be unable to control the quality of these services or adequately address problems that arise 
expanding our operations in this manner also will require significant additional expenses and development  operations and other resources and will strain our management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of acceptance of any new businesses or services could harm our business  damage our reputation  and diminish the value of our brand 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately 
we regard the protection of our trademarks  copyrights  patents  domain names  trade dress  and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark  copyright  patent  trade dress and trade secret laws  and through the domain name dispute resolution system 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  trade dress  trade secret  and domain name protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation 
we must protect our trademarks  patents  and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
we own real property including land and buildings related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability act  or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  neighboring owners  or others 

table of contents some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of six months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of the total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 
we entered into two interest rate swaps on june and july   with notional amounts totaling million to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the floating rate operating lease for our san jose headquarters office facilities 
the interest rate swaps allow us to receive floating rate receipts based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  in exchange for making fixed rate payments which effectively changes our interest rate exposure on our operating lease from a floating rate to a fixed rate on million of the total million notional amount of our san jose headquarters facility lease commitment 
the balance of million remains at a floating rate of interest based on the spread over month libor 
if the month libor rates were to increase decrease by basis points  then our payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of december  was an unrealized loss of approximately  net of tax benefit  and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
the interest rate swap will mature in march  at which time the lease will expire and we will purchase our san jose headquarters facility 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity investments we hold  typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments 
in accordance with our policy to assess whether an impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value and other market conditions  we determined that declines in fair value of certain of our 
table of contents marketable and non marketable equity investments were other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges totaling million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of certain equity investments 
we did not record an impairment charge related to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments during the year ended december  at december   the total carrying value of our equity instruments and equity method investment was million  including million in marketable investments 
at december   the total carrying value of our equity investments was million  including million in marketable investments 
foreign currency risk international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency  which is primarily the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound  as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
in addition  at december   we held balances in cash  cash equivalents and investments outside the us totaling approximately million 
transaction exposure as of december   we had outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately million with maturity dates within days 
the hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended december   was a net translation gain of approximately million 
this gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
we consolidate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation fas 
such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options and forward contracts 
the aggregate notional amount of these hedges entered into in was million euro and million british pounds 
the loss on these hedges for totaled approximately million  which were recorded in interest and other income  net 
all contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed 
economic exposure we currently charge our foreign subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of ebay s intellectual property and technology and for corporate services provided by ebay inc such as insurance  tax and legal 
this charge is denominated in euros and these forecasted inter company transaction at ebay inc represent a 
table of contents foreign currency cash flow exposure 
to reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these forecasted inter company transactions  we entered into forward foreign exchange contacts during the year ended december  the objective of the forward contracts is to ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  we expect the hedge of these forecasted transactions to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
accordingly  we record as a component of other comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment 
we record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and other income  net  related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge accounting treatment pursuant to fas there were no outstanding forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment at december  the following table shows the notional amount of our economic hedges entered into in  together with the associated losses  net of gains  recorded in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   and the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  accumulated net loss recorded other notional to interest and comprehensive amount other income  net income in thousands amount receiving hedge accounting treatment under fas amount not receiving hedge accounting treatment under fas total no economic hedges were entered into during the year ended december
