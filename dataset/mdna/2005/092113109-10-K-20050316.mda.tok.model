wholesale energy group our wholesale energy group  which operates through black hills energy and its subsidiaries  engages in the production and sale of electric capacity and energy through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants  the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  and the marketing and transportation of energy products 
the wholesale energy group consists of four segments power generation  natural gas and crude oil production  coal mining  and energy marketing and transportation 
power generation segment our power generation segment acquires  develops  expands and operates unregulated power plants 
we currently hold varying interests in independent power plants in colorado  nevada  wyoming and california with a total net ownership of megawatts  and minority interests in several power related funds with a net ownership interest of megawatts 
we also own a megawatt plant in massachusetts currently held for sale 
how we manage our portfolio 
we maintain a geographically diverse portfolio of power plants in our wholesale business group  with a focus on the western region of the united states 
the fuel mix of our unregulated portfolio is approximately percent natural gas fired and percent coal fired 
we sell capacity and energy under a combination of mid to long term contracts  and make certain spot sales into the energy markets  thereby allowing us to mitigate the impact of a potential downturn in prices in the future 
currently  we sell approximately percent of our unregulated generating capacity under contracts having terms of greater than one year  and we sell the balance under short term contracts or by spot sales into the wholesale power markets 
we also mitigate our financial exposure in the power generation segment by selling a substantial majority of our unregulated capacity and energy under tolling agreements  or agreements under which the power purchaser is responsible for supplying fuel for the facility  thus assuming fuel price risk

the fountain valley and valmont facilities operate in simple cycle  and the arapahoe facility operates in combined cycle 
we sell all of the output from these plants to psco under tolling contracts expiring in las vegas cogeneration facilities 
our las vegas i facility is a megawatt  combined cycle  gas fired plant northeast of las vegas  nevada  and is a qualifying facility  or qf  under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
we sell megawatts of power from this plant to nevada power under a long term contract that expires in under the terms of the nevada power contract  we assume the fuel price risk associated with the energy generation 
while we own percent of this plant  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we consolidate percent of the plant in our financial statements 
our las vegas ii facility is a wholly owned  megawatt  combined cycle  gas fired plant that became operational early in in december  we executed a new long term tolling agreement with nevada power for the capacity and power from this plant  which expires december  we obtained regulatory approval for the new contract in march and commenced selling to nevada power under the contract on april  gillette ct 
the gillette ct  is a wholly owned simple cycle  gas fired combustion turbine located near gillette  wyoming at the same site as our wygen plant and wyodak mine  has a total capacity of megawatts and became operational in may we have a year power purchase agreement with clf p for the sale of the energy and capacity from this facility 
in connection with clf p s execution of the all requirements power purchase agreement with psco  the gillette ct power purchase agreement was temporarily assigned from clf p to psco for the four year term of the all requirements agreement  which expires december  during the remaining term of the temporary assignment  we assume intra month fuel price risks under this agreement since the fuel price is fixed at the outset of each month and psco has the right to dispatch the facility on a day ahead basis 
we are permitted to remarket the energy that is not prescheduled by psco 
wygen plant 
the wygen plant is a mine mouth  coal fired plant with a total capacity of megawatts  which commenced operations in the first quarter of we have contracts to sell megawatts of unit contingent capacity and energy from this plant to clf p with a term of years  and megawatts of unit contingent capacity and energy to the municipal energy agency of nebraska mean for a term of years 
as with the gillette ct power purchase agreement  clf p has temporarily assigned the wygen power purchase agreement to psco for the term of its all requirements power purchase agreement  which expires december  we are the lessee of the wygen plant under a synthetic lease with a financial counterparty  but under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we consolidate percent of the plant in our financial statements 
ontario cogeneration facility 
our ontario facility  a qf  is a megawatt  chang cycle  gas fired power plant in ontario  california  which we currently operate as a baseload plant 
electrical output from the plant is subject to a year power purchase agreement with southern california edison sce  which expires in january the project also sells steam production to sunkist growers  inc under a five year agreement  which terminates in november we own percent of this plant  and under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we consolidate percent of the plant in our financial statements 
harbor cogeneration facility 
harbor cogeneration is a megawatt  combined cycle  gas fired plant located at the port of long beach  california 
through october  the facility sold capacity and energy under a summer tolling agreement with sce 
we entered into a new tolling agreement with sce under which sce will purchase all of the capacity and energy of the facility commencing april  through may  under a termination agreement with sce pertaining to a long term contract that was previously terminated  harbor cogeneration also receives payments pursuant to a termination payment schedule for a period ending on october  northeast facilities 
during  we decided to exit the eastern market and divest our assets in that region 
in september  we completed the sale of our ownership interests in seven hydroelectric plants in new york 
these plants had a combined nameplate capacity of approximately megawatts 
in addition  we announced our intention to sell our megawatt gas fired plant located in pepperell  massachusetts 
power funds 
in addition to our ownership of the power plants described above  we hold various indirect interests in power plants through our investment in energy and energy related funds  both domestic and international  with a total net capacity of approximately megawatts 
fund name number of plants total capacity mws interest net capacity mws energy investors fund i energy investors fund ii project finance fund iii caribbean basin total fund interests project development program 
through our active project development program  we are developing and pursuing the acquisition of a number of additional unregulated generation projects  ranging from the expansion of existing generating capacity  or brownfield development  to the acquisition or development of new generating facilities 
our primary geographic focus has been  and is likely to remain  in the north american electric reliability council region known as the wecc 
among the factors we consider important in evaluating new or expanded generation opportunities are the following potential electric demand growth in the targeted region  regional generation capacity characteristics  permitting and siting requirements  proximity of the proposed site to high transmission capacity corridors  fuel supply reliability and pricing  the local regulatory environment  and the potential to exploit market expertise and operating efficiencies relating to geographic concentration of new generation with our existing power plant and fuel production portfolio 
our goal is to sell a substantial majority of the independent power generation portfolio under long term contracts  while reserving the balance for merchant  or spot  sales 
our strategy is to seek long term contracts with either utilities serving native customer loads with state utility commission approved contracts  or investment grade counterparties 
to limit our financial exposure  we typically project finance our unregulated power generation facilities so that the lenders will only have recourse to a specific facility 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing any or all of the projects currently under consideration 
oil and gas segment our oil and gas segment  which operates primarily through our black hills exploration and production  inc subsidiary  is involved in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of natural gas and crude oil resources 
we hold interests in oil and gas properties located in alabama  california  colorado  louisiana  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oklahoma  texas and wyoming and we own and operate a natural gas gathering pipeline in new mexico 
we operate approximately oil and gas wells and also own a working interest in  but do not operate  an additional wells 
we also own a percent interest in the newcastle gas processing plant located in weston county  wyoming adjacent to certain of our producing properties in that area

coal mining segment our coal mining segment  which operates through our wyodak resources development corp 
subsidiary  mines and processes low sulfur  sub bituminous coal at our wyodak coal mine near gillette  wyoming 
the wyodak mine  which we acquired in from homestake gold mining company  is located in the powder river basin  one of the largest coal reserves in the united states 
we produced approximately million tons of coal in mining rights to the coal are based on four federal leases and one state lease 
we pay royalties of percent and percent  respectively  of the selling price on all federal and state coal 
as of december   we had coal reserves of approximately million tons  based on an updated internal reserve study completed in the reserves would be enough to satisfy present contracts for approximately years at current production levels 
substantially all of our coal production is currently sold under long term contracts to our electric utility  black hills power  the megawatt wyodak power plant owned percent by pacificorp and percent by black hills power  pacificorp at the dave johnston power plant located near casper  wyoming  served by rail  our unregulated mine mouth power plant  wygen  and certain industrial customers served by truck 
we also expect to increase our coal production to supply additional mine mouth generating capacity at the same site as the wygen plant  which we are in the early stages of developing  and future sales of coal to regional rail and truck served customers 
our coal mining segment s agreement with black hills power limits earnings from all coal sales to black hills power to a specified return on our cost depreciated investment base 
black hills power made a commitment to the south dakota public utilities commission sdpuc  the wyoming public service commission wpsc and the city of gillette that coal would be furnished and priced as provided by that agreement for the life of black hills power s neil simpson ii plant  which black hills power placed into service in the price for unprocessed coal sold to pacificorp for its percent interest in the wyodak plant is determined by a coal supply agreement terminating in energy marketing and transportation segment we market natural gas and crude oil in specific regions of the united states and canada 
we offer physical and financial wholesale energy marketing and price risk management products and services to a variety of customers 
the customers of our energy marketing and transportation segment include natural gas distribution companies  municipalities  industrial users  oil and gas producers  electric utilities  other energy marketers  and retail gas users 
our average daily marketing volumes for the year ended december  were approximately million mmbtu  or million british thermal units of gas  and  barrels of oil

our producer marketing services include purchases of wellhead gas  risk transfer and hedging products for gas producers in the rocky mountain region 
our gas marketing efforts are concentrated in the rocky mountain  western and mid continent regions of the united states and in canada 
we hold  under contract  natural gas storage capacity and both long and short term transportation capacity on several major pipelines in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and in western canada 
black hills energy resources  inc our crude oil marketing and transportation operations are headquartered in houston  texas and are concentrated primarily in texas  oklahoma and louisiana 
our crude oil marketing business specializes in providing independent crude oil producers with marketing and transportation services to market their crude oil production to end user markets 
in addition  we own  operate or lease the following facilities millennium pipeline system 
we own and operate the millennium pipeline system  a mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately  barrels of oil per day 
the pipeline transports imported crude oil from beaumont  texas to longview  texas  a transfer point to connecting carriers 
we recently extended the long term contract for the transport of petroleum products on the millennium pipeline system through the third quarter of through this long term contract  the capacity on this pipeline is substantially subscribed 
millennium terminal 
through the millennium terminal  we lease million barrels of crude oil storage at the oil tanking terminal located in beaumont 
the millennium terminal storage facility is connected to our millennium pipeline system 
kilgore pipeline system 
we also own and operate the kilgore pipeline system  a mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day 
the pipeline transports crude oil from kilgore  texas south to houston  texas  a transfer point to connecting carriers 
we have a long term agreement for the transport of petroleum products on the kilgore pipeline that also expires in the third quarter of through this long term contract  the capacity of this pipeline is significantly subscribed 
in addition  we have approximately  barrels of crude oil storage at kilgore and  barrels of storage at the texoma tank farm located in longview  texas 
retail services group electric utility segment our electric utility  black hills power  is engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity 
it provides us with a solid foundation of revenues  earnings and cash flow 
distribution and transmission 
black hills power s distribution and transmission businesses serve approximately  electric customers  with an electric transmission system of miles of high voltage lines and miles of lower voltage lines 
in addition  black hills power jointly owns miles of high voltage lines with basin electric cooperative 
black hills power s service territory covers a  square mile area of western south dakota  northeastern wyoming and southeastern montana with a strong and stable economic base 
approximately percent of black hills power s retail electric revenues in were generated in south dakota 
the following are characteristics of black hills power s distribution and transmission businesses we have a diverse customer and revenue base 
our revenue mix for the year ended december  was comprised of percent commercial  percent residential  percent contract wholesale  percent wholesale off system  percent industrial and percent municipal sales and other revenue 
approximately percent of our large commercial and industrial customers are provided service under long term contracts 
we have historically optimized the utilization of our power supply resources by selling wholesale power to other utilities and to power marketers in the spot market and through short term sales contracts 
black hills power is subject to regulation by the south dakota public utilities commission sdpuc and the wyoming public service commission wpsc 
the retail rate freeze granted to black hills power by the sdpuc  which had been in effect for years  expired on january  black hills power s current rates in south dakota and wyoming remain in place following the expiration of the rate freeze 
the rate freeze preserved our low cost rate structure for our retail customers at levels below the national average while allowing us to retain the benefits from cost savings and from wholesale off system sales  which were not covered by the rate freeze 
our rates do not include a fuel or a purchased power adjustment  so we continue to have the flexibility in allocating our generating capacity to wholesale off system sales 
while we are not obligated to do so  we are permitted to petition the sdpuc and wpsc for a rate increase at any time  or the sdpuc and wpsc may require that we do so 
we do not expect to request a rate increase for black hills power during percent of our electric revenues for the year ended december  consisted of off system and short term contract wholesale sales 
black hills power and basin electric power cooperative completed the construction of an ac dc ac transmission tie in the fourth quarter of black hills power owns and basin electric owns of the transmission tie 
the transmission tie provides an interconnection between the western and eastern transmission grids  enabling access to both the wecc region in the west  and the mid continent area power pool  or mapp region in the east 
the black hills power system is located in the wecc region 
the total transfer capacity of the tie is megawatts megawatts from west to east and megawatts from east to west 
this transmission tie allows us to buy and sell energy in the eastern interconnection without having to isolate and physically reconnect load or generation between the two electrical transmission grids 
the transmission tie is bidirectional and thus accommodates scheduling transactions in both directions simultaneously 
this transfer capability provides additional opportunity to sell our excess generation or to make economic purchases to serve our native load and our contract obligations  and to take advantage of the power price differentials between the two electric grids 
additionally  black hills power s system is capable of directly interconnecting up to megawatts of generation or load to the eastern transmission grid 
transmission constraints within the mapp transmission system may limit the amount of capacity that may be directly interconnected to the eastern system at any given time 
we have firm point to point transmission access to deliver up to megawatts of power on pacificorp s transmission system to wholesale customers in the western region from through and megawatts from through we have firm network transmission access to deliver power on pacificorp s system to sheridan  wyoming to serve our power sales contract with montana dakota utilities company mdu through  with the right to renew pursuant to the terms of pacificorp s transmission tariff 
power sales agreements 
we sell a portion of black hills power s current load under long term contracts 
our key contracts include an agreement with mdu  expiring at the end of  for the sale of up to megawatts of capacity and energy to serve the sheridan  wyoming electric service territory 
we recently entered into a new power purchase agreement with mdu for the supply of up to megawatts of capacity and energy for sheridan  wyoming through  which is pending regulatory approval by the wpsc  and an agreement with the city of gillette  wyoming  expiring in  to provide the city s first megawatts of capacity and energy 
these consumers are integrated into black hills power s control area and are treated as firm native load 
black hills power also provides megawatts of unit contingent energy and capacity to mean under a contract that expires in regulated power plants and purchased power 
black hills power s electric load is primarily served by its generating facilities in south dakota and wyoming  which provide megawatts of generating capacity  with the balance supplied under purchased power and capacity contracts 
approximately percent of black hills power s capacity is coal fired  percent is oil or gas fired  and percent is supplied under the following purchased power contracts with pacificorp a power purchase agreement expiring in  involving the purchase by black hills power of megawatts of baseload power  and a reserve capacity integration agreement expiring in  which makes available to black hills power megawatts of reserve capacity in connection with the utilization of the ben french ct units 
since  black hills power has been a net producer of energy 
black hills power reached its peak system load of megawatts in august none of black hills power s generation is restricted by hours of operation  thereby providing it the ability to generate power to meet demand whenever necessary and feasible

the plant was placed into service in and operates as a baseload plant 
communications segment our communications segment  which primarily operates through our subsidiary black hills fibercom  was formed to provide state of the art broadband telecommunications services to the markets of rapid city and the northern black hills of south dakota 
we offer residential and business customers broadband telecommunications services  including local and long distance telephone service  expanded cable television service  cable modem internet access and high speed data and video services 
we have completed a mile inter and intra city fiber optic network and currently operate miles of two way interactive hybrid fiber coaxial or hfc cable 
we bundle these services into value packages with a single consolidated bill for all of these services 
we introduced our broadband communications services to the rapid city and northern black hills areas in november as of december   we were serving  residential customers and  business customers 
the construction of our initial infrastructure build out  which covers much of rapid city and the northern black hills region  was completed in while we continue to modestly increase the system  we are currently focused on achieving operating efficiencies  both internal to our communications group and those that can be realized by integrating appropriate business functions with related utility operations in our retail business group and at the corporate or service company level 
combination electric and gas utility segment we acquired clf p in january  and we will report its operations as a new segment within the retail services group in future sec filings 
electric system 
clf p s electric system serves approximately  customers in cheyenne  wyoming and vicinity  and has a peak load of megawatts 
power is supplied to clf p under an all requirements contract with psco 
the all requirements contract expires in natural gas system 
clf p s natural gas distribution system serves approximately  natural gas customers in cheyenne  wyoming and vicinity 
clf p s annual natural gas sales and transportation during were approximately million mmbtus  with sales to commercial and residential customers accounting for approximately million mmbtus and transportation accounting for approximately million mmbtus 
clf p purchases natural gas from independent suppliers 
the natural gas supplies are delivered to the respective delivery systems through a combination of transportation agreements with interstate pipelines and deliveries by suppliers directly to each company 
the balance of the quantities required to meet firm peak day sales obligations are primarily purchased at clf p s city gate meter station and a small amount is received directly from wellhead sources 
competition the independent power  fuel production and energy marketing industries are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors  some of which may have more extensive operating experience  larger staffs or greater financial resources than us 
the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  has implemented and continues to favor regulatory initiatives to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non utility purchasers and sellers of electricity and to enhance competition in wholesale electricity markets 
in addition  a number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition 
industry deregulation in some states has led to the disaggregation of some vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission and distribution businesses  and deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation 
however  the pace of restructuring slowed significantly following public and governmental reactions to issues associated with deregulation efforts in california and the collapse of its wholesale electric energy market in retail competition has not yet been implemented in south dakota  wyoming  or montana 
in addition  congress in recent years has considered various legislative proposals to restructure the electric industry that would require  among other things  customer choice and or repeal of puhca 
the debate is likely to continue and perhaps intensify 
we cannot predict the likelihood or effect of such legislation with any degree of certainty 
as a result of these potential regulatory changes  significant additional competitors could become active in the generation and power marketing segments of our industry 
our communications unit faces strong competition from several companies  including qwest corporation  rapid city s incumbent local exchange carrier and midcontinent communications  the area s incumbent cable television provider  as well as long distance providers  cellular providers  satellite providers and internet service providers 
our success in this business will depend upon  among other things  the quality of our customer service  the willingness of residential and business customers to accept us as an alternative provider of broadband communications products and services and our ability to offer an attractive package of bundled products 
risk management our business operations require effective management of price  counterparty performance and operational risks 
price risk arises from the volatility of energy prices 
counterparty performance risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to satisfy its contractual obligations to us  and includes credit risk 
operational risk is the risk that we will be unable to perform on our contractual obligations to our counterparties 
we have implemented controls to mitigate each of these risks 
our energy marketing operations are conducted in accordance with guidelines established through separate risk management policies and procedures for each marketing company and through our credit policy and procedures 
these policies and procedures specify maximum price risk exposure levels within which each respective marketing company must operate 
these policies are established and approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
the policies are reviewed on a regular basis and monitored as described below 
we have an active risk management committee  which oversees each of our marketing companies  and a credit committee  which oversees credit for the entire corporate organization 
the risk management committee focuses on implementation of risk management procedures and on monitoring compliance with established policies 
the credit committee monitors credit exposure levels and reviews compliance with established credit policies 
our chief risk officer is responsible for overseeing these functions 
we further limit the exposure of our parent holding company  black hills corporation  to energy marketing risks by maintaining separate credit facilities within each of our energy marketing companies 
these credit facilities have security interests solely against the assets of the respective marketing company 
in addition  we limit the number and amount of any parent guarantees for the marketing companies 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to manage such risks  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
regulation we are subject to a broad range of federal  state and local energy and environmental laws and regulations applicable to the development  ownership and operation of our projects  and our utility operations are subject to federal and state rate regulation 
these laws and regulations generally require that a wide variety of permits and other approvals be obtained before construction or operation of a project commences and that  after completion  the facility operate in compliance with such requirements 
our public utilities operate subject to tariffs and rate schedules that must be filed with  and accepted by  state and federal regulatory commissions 
we strive to comply with the terms of all such laws  regulations  permits  licenses  rate schedules  and tariffs and believe that all of our operations are in material compliance with all such applicable requirements 
energy regulation public utility holding company act of as a registered holding company  we are subject to regulatory oversight by the sec under puhca 
the rules and regulations under puhca impose a number of restrictions on the operations of registered holding company systems 
these restrictions include  subject to certain exceptions  a requirement that the sec approve securities issuances  payments of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus  sales and acquisitions of utility assets or of securities of utility companies  and acquisitions of other businesses 
puhca also generally limits the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system  plus additional energy related and other approved businesses 
puhca rules require that members of a holding company system obtain certain common services  such as accounting  administrative  information systems  engineering  financial  legal  maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider  and so we have formed black hills services company  llc  as a services company for the black hills corporation system 
puhca rules also require that transactions between affiliated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost  with limited exceptions 
registered holding companies are subject to accounting  record keeping and periodic reporting requirements administered by the sec 
federal power act 
the federal power act gives ferc exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce 
pursuant to the federal power act  all public utilities subject to ferc s jurisdiction are required to file tariffs and rate schedules with ferc prior to commencement of wholesale sales or interstate transmission of electricity 
public utilities are also subject to accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements administered by ferc 
ferc also places certain limitations on transactions between public utilities and their unregulated affiliates 
the energy policy act 
the passage of the energy policy act in further encouraged independent power production by providing certain exemptions from regulation for exempt wholesale generators  or ewgs 
an ewg is an entity that is directly or indirectly  and exclusively  in the business of owning or operating  or both owning and operating  eligible facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale 
an ewg is not regulated as an electric utility under puhca  but is subject to ferc regulation  including rate regulation 
all of our non utility subsidiaries that would otherwise be treated as electric utilities under puhca are currently treated as ewgs under the energy policy act or qfs under purpa 
all of our ewgs have been granted market based rate authority  which allows ferc to waive certain accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements imposed on public utilities with cost based rates 
however  ferc customarily reserves the right to suspend  upon complaint  market based rate authority on a prospective basis if it is subsequently determined that any of our ewgs exercised market power 
if ferc were to suspend market based rate authority for any of our ewgs  those ewgs most likely would be required to file  and obtain ferc acceptance of  cost based power sales rate schedules 
also  the loss of market based rate authority would subject the ewgs to the accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with cost based rate schedules 
in addition  if there occurs a material change in facts that might affect any of our subsidiaries eligibility for ewg status  within days of the material change  the relevant ewg must file a written explanation of why the material change does not affect its ewg status  file a new application for ewg status  or notify ferc that it no longer wishes to maintain ewg status 
if any of our subsidiaries were to lose ewg status  we likely would be subject to additional layers of regulation under puhca 
purpa 
the enactment of purpa in provided incentives for the development of qualifying cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities that utilized certain alternative or renewable fuels qfs 
qf status conveys two primary benefits 
first  regulations under purpa exempt qfs from puhca  most provisions of the federal power act and the state laws concerning rates  and financial and organizational regulations of electric utilities 
second  ferc s regulations under purpa require that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by qfs at a price based on the purchasing utility s full avoided cost of producing power  the electric utilities must sell back up  interruptible  maintenance and supplemental power to the qf on a non discriminatory basis  and the electric utilities must interconnect with any qf in its service territory  and  if required  transmit power if they do not purchase it 
we operate our las vegas i and ontario facilities as qfs 
we endeavor to acquire  develop and operate our qfs in a manner that minimizes the risk of those plants losing their qf status 
however  if a facility were to lose qf status  we could attempt to avoid its regulation as an additional public utility company in our registered holding company system under puhca by qualifying the project as an ewg 
state energy regulation 
in areas outside of wholesale rate regulation such as financial or organizational regulation  some state utility laws may give their public utility commissions broad jurisdiction over steam sales or ewgs that sell power in their service territories 
the actual scope of the jurisdiction over steam or independent power projects depends on state law and varies significantly from state to state 
retail rate regulation black hills power 
the rate freeze granted by the sdpuc  which had been in effect for black hills power since  expired on january  during this ten year term  black hills power was prohibited  subject to certain limited exceptions  from filing for any increase in its rates or invoking any fuel and purchased power adjustment tariff which would take effect during the freeze period 
while the rate freeze has expired  black hills power cannot raise rates without initiating a proceeding before the sdpuc and the wpsc and receiving approval from these commissions 
as such  black hills power s current rates remain in effect 
unless and until black hills power files for and receives a rate increase  it is undertaking the risks of machinery failure  load loss caused by either an economic downturn or changes in regulation  costs of fuel commodities  increased costs under power purchase contracts over which it has no control  government interferences  and acts of nature and other unexpected events that could cause material losses of income or increases in costs of doing business 
under its current structure  however  black hills power will continue to retain earnings realized from more efficient operations  sales from load growth  and off system sales of power and energy 
beginning in the mid s  we initiated an effort to enter into new contracts with our largest commercial and industrial customers 
most of the new contracts contain meet or release provisions that grant us a five year right to continue to serve a customer at market rates in the event of deregulation 
additionally  through our general service large optional combined account billing tariff  we have allowed general service customers to aggregate their loads 
this tariff also provides us with a five year right to continue to serve those customers in the event of deregulation 
our meet or release contracts currently total more than megawatts of large commercial and industrial load 
these contracts provide us with greater assurance of a firm local market for our power resources in the event deregulation occurs 
these industrial and large commercial customers  together with our wholesale power sale agreements with the city of gillette  wyoming and mdu  equal approximately percent of black hills power s firm load 
clf p 
our clf p electric and natural gas distribution utility  which we acquired in january  is subject to the jurisdiction of the wpsc with respect to its facilities  rates  accounts  services and issuance of securities 
clf p is subject to the jurisdiction of ferc with respect to accounting practices and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce 
all electric demand and purchased power costs are recoverable through an energy adjustment clause subject to wpsc jurisdiction 
all purchased gas costs are recoverable through a gas cost adjustment clause  also subject to wpsc jurisdiction 
differences in costs incurred from costs recovered in rates  including interest  are deferred and recovered through prospective adjustments to rates 
rate changes for cost recovery require wpsc approval before going into effect 
as part of obtaining approval from the wpsc for the acquisition of clf p  we agreed that clf p would be barred from increasing its retail rates prior to january   other than pursuant to gas and electric cost adjustments 
however  we plan to cause clf p to file a rate case during for rates to be effective on or soon after january  environmental regulation the construction and operation of power projects  coal mines  oil and gas exploration and production  gas transportation and crude oil handling facilities are subject to extensive environmental protection and land use regulation in the united states 
these laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
if such laws and regulations are changed and our facilities are not grandfathered  extensive modifications to project technologies and facilities could be required 
general 
based on current trends  we expect that environmental and land use regulation will continue to be stringent 
accordingly  we actively review proposed construction projects that could subject us to stringent pollution controls imposed on major modifications  as defined under the clean air act  and changes in discharge characteristics  as defined under the clean water act 
the goal of these actions is to achieve compliance with applicable regulations  administrative consent orders and variances from applicable air quality related regulations 
air quality 
our neil simpson ii  neil simpson ct  gillette ct  wygen  arapahoe  valmont  fountain valley  las vegas ii  lange ct and wyodak plants are all subject to title iv of the clean air act  which requires certain fossil fuel fired combustion devices to hold sulfur dioxide so allowances for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted 
we currently hold sufficient allowances credited to us as a result of sulfur removal equipment previously installed at the wyodak plant to apply to the operation of all units subject to title iv through without requiring the purchase of any additional allowances 
with respect to any future plants  we plan to comply with the need for holding the appropriate number of allowances by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions through the use of low sulfur fuels  installation of back end control technology  use of banked allowances left over from our unused portion of wyodak allowances and if necessary  the purchase of allowances on the open market 
we expect to integrate the costs of obtaining the required number of allowances needed for future projects into our overall financial analysis of such projects 
in july  the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized rules designed to protect and improve visibility impairment resulting from air emissions 
among other things  the regulations required states to identify sources of emissions including certain coal fired generating units built between and by that would be subject to best available retrofit technology  known as bart 
these sources would be required to implement bart within five years after the epa approves state plans adopted to combat visibility impairment 
subsequent litigation has removed epa s requirement mandating that states adopt and impose bart requirements  however  it remains an option for states to use in addressing visibility impairment 
we believe our only existing plant which may be required to comply with the bart requirements is our neil simpson i plant in wyoming 
late in  the state of wyoming elected to manage visibility impairment through cfr part grand canyon visibility transport states  or the program 
under this program  there is a backstop so emission trading program that eliminates the need for bart in the states that opt into the program 
therefore  neil simpson i will not have to implement bart controls  but all of our plants will fall under the backstop so emission trading program if it is triggered to be implemented 
the trading program would be triggered if annual so emission reductions do not remain in a declining trend 
after discussions with wyoming regulatory staff  we believe this program will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we are aware of a february  decision by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that grants a petition for review of this rule 
until this issue is ultimately resolved  we are unable to evaluate its impact 
we are aware that other states in which we have power plants are required to submit their visibility impairment plans to epa between and and that compliance is due within five years of epa approval 
we believe that any capital expenditures associated with future compliance requirements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
title v of the clean air act imposes federal requirements  which dictate that all of our fossil fuel fired generation facilities must obtain operating permits 
all of our existing facilities subject to this requirement have submitted title v permit applications and either have received or are in the process of receiving permits 
on november   the united states department of justice filed suit against a number of electric utilities for alleged violations of the clean air act s new source review nsr requirements related to modifications of air emissions sources at electric generating stations located in the southern and midwestern regions of the united states 
several states joined these lawsuits 
in addition  the epa has also issued administrative notices of violation alleging similar violations at additional power plants owned by some of the same utilities named as defendants in the department of justice lawsuit 
the epa has also issued requests for information pursuant to the clean air act to numerous other electric utilities seeking to determine whether those utilities also engaged in activities that may have been in violation of the clean air act s nsr requirements 
in may  the epa notified pacificorp that it is investigating similar activities at their wyodak plant  in which we hold a percent ownership interest 
we are receiving copies of all information provided to epa 
at this time no legal proceedings have commenced 
no such nsr proceedings have been initiated or requests for information issued with respect to any of our other facilities  but we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to similar proceedings in the future 
in december  the epa announced its intention to regulate mercury emissions from coal and oil fired electric power plants 
in december  the epa issued proposed rules and solicited comments on regulatory options for regulating mercury 
final rules are expected in march however  there is also action in congress regarding the administration s clear skies package  which may alter the epa s mercury rulemaking process by implementing a cap and trade program 
until these efforts are finalized  we are not able to fully evaluate the impact of mercury regulations on the operation of our facilities 
since the adoption of the united nations framework on climate change in  there has been worldwide attention with respect to greenhouse gas emissions  in particular carbon dioxide 
in december  the clinton administration participated in the kyoto  japan negotiations  where the basis of a climate change treaty was formulated 
under the treaty  known as the kyoto protocol  the united states would be required  between and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by percent from levels 
the treaty has never been ratified by the united states  although discussions continue regarding climate change issues 
although legislative developments on the state level related to controlling greenhouse gas emissions have occurred  we are not aware of any similar developments in the states in which we operate 
if we should become subject to limitations on emissions of carbon dioxide from our power plants  these requirements could have a significant impact on our operations 
clean water act 
our existing facilities are also subject to a variety of state and federal regulations governing existing and potential water wastewater discharges and protection of surface waters from oil pollution 
generally  such regulations are promulgated under authority of the clean water act and govern overall water wastewater discharges through national pollutant discharge elimination system  or npdes  permits 
under current provisions of the clean water act  existing npdes permits must be renewed every five years  at which time permit limits are extensively reviewed and can be modified to account for changes in regulations or program initiatives 
in addition  the permits have re opener clauses which allow the permitting authority which may be the united states or an authorized state to attempt to modify a permit to conform to changes in applicable laws and regulations 
some of our existing facilities have been operating under npdes permits for many years and have gone through one or more npdes permit renewal cycles 
all of our facilities required to have npdes permits have those permits in place and are in compliance with discharge limitations 
there are no proposed regulations that we are aware of that will have a significant impact on our operations 
the stream that receives discharges from the ben french plant is expected to be re classified within the next few years 
if that occurs  we expect that discharge limits will become more restrictive 
at this time we are unable to assess those impacts until more information is known 
additionally  the epa regulates surface water oil pollution prevention through its oil pollution prevention regulations 
all facilities regulated under this program have their required plans in place 
solid waste disposal 
we dispose of all solid wastes collected as a result of burning coal at our power plants in approved solid waste disposal sites 
each disposal site has been permitted by the state of its location in compliance with law 
ash and wastes from flue gas and sulfur removal from the wyodak  wygen  neil simpson i  ben french and neil simpson ii plants are deposited in mined areas at our wyodak coal mine 
these disposal areas are located below some shallow water aquifers in the mine 
none of the solid wastes from the burning of coal is classified as hazardous material  but the wastes do contain minute traces of metals that would be perceived as polluting if such metals leached into underground water 
investigations have concluded that the wastes are relatively insoluble and will not measurably affect the post mining ground water quality 
while we do not believe that any substances from our solid waste disposal activities will pollute underground water  we cannot assure you that no pollution will occur over time 
in this event  we could experience material costs to mitigate any resulting damages 
agreements in place require pacificorp to be responsible for any such costs that would be related to the solid waste from its percent interest in the wyodak plant 
additional unexpected material costs could also result in the future if any regulator determines that solid waste from the burning of coal contains some hazardous material that requires special treatment  including solid waste of which we previously disposed 
in that event  the government regulator could consequently hold those entities that disposed of such waste responsible for such treatment 
pipeline operations 
the operations of pipelines and other facilities for gathering  transporting  processing or storing natural gas and crude oil is subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health  safety and the environment 
as an owner or operator of these facilities  we must comply with federal  state and local laws that relate to air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste management and disposal  and other environmental matters 
costs of constructing and operating pipelines  plants and other facilities must incorporate compliance with environmental laws  regulations and safety standards 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and potentially criminal enforcement measures 
mine reclamation 
under federal and state laws and regulations  we are required to submit to the regulation by  and receive approval from  the wyoming department of environmental quality deq for a mining and reclamation plan which provides for orderly mining  reclamation and restoration of our entire wyodak coal mine in conformity with state laws and regulations 
we have an approved mining permit and are otherwise in compliance with other permitting programs administered by various regulatory agencies 
based on extensive reclamation studies  we have accrued approximately million on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for these reclamation costs 
no assurance can be given that additional requirements in the future will not be imposed that would cause an unexpected material increase in reclamation costs 
one situation that could result in substantial unexpected increases in costs relating to our reclamation permit concerns three depressions the south depression  the peerless depression and the clovis pit depression that have or will result from our mining activities at the wyodak mine 
because of the thick coal seam and relatively shallow overburden  the current restoration plan would leave these depressions  which have limited reclamation potential  with interior drainage only 
although the deq has accepted the current plan to limit reclamation of these depressions  it has reserved the right to review and evaluate future reclamation plans or to reevaluate the existing reclamation plan 
if as a result of our mining activities  additional overburden becomes available  the deq may require us to conduct additional reclamation of the depressions  particularly if the deq finds that the current limited reclamation is resulting in exceedances in the deq s water quality standards 
ben french oil spill 
in and  we discovered extensive underground fuel oil contamination at the ben french plant site 
with the help of expert consultants  we worked closely with the south dakota department of environment and natural resources to assess and remediate the site 
our assessment  remediation and site monitoring efforts continue today 
all of our underground oil carrying facilities from which the contamination occurred are now above ground 
there have been no significant recoveries of free fuel oil product since soil borings and monitoring wells on the perimeters of our ben french plant property provide no indication of contamination beyond the property s limits 
we believe that the underground spill has been sufficiently remedied so as to prevent any oil from migrating off site 
however  due to underground gypsum deposits in this area  the fuel oil has the potential of migrating to area waterways 
in such event  cleanup costs could be greatly increased 
we believe that sufficient remediation efforts to prevent such a migration are currently in place  but due to the uncertainties of underground geology  we cannot assure you that no such migration will occur 
cleanup costs recognized to date total approximately million  of which amount million has been reimbursed by the south dakota petroleum release compensation fund 
to date  no penalties  claims or actions have been taken or threatened against us because of this oil spill 
in  the south dakota department of environment and natural resources permanently closed numerous monitoring wells which showed no contamination for several years 
pcbs 
under the federal toxic substances control act  the epa has issued regulations that control the use and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls  or pcbs 
pcbs were widely used as insulating fluids in many electric utility transformers and capacitors manufactured before the toxic substances control act prohibited any further manufacture of pcb equipment 
we remove and dispose of pcb contaminated equipment in compliance with law as it is discovered 
release of pcb contaminated fluids  especially any involving a fire or a release into a waterway  could result in substantial cleanup costs 
several years ago  we began a testing program of potential pcb contaminated transformers  and in completed testing of all transformers and capacitors which are not located in our electric substations 
we have not completed the testing of sealed potential transformers and bushings located in our electric substations as the testing of this equipment requires their destruction 
release of pcb contaminated fluid  if present  from our equipment is unlikely and the volume of fluid in such equipment is generally less than one gallon 
moreover  any release of this fluid would be confined to our substation site 
regulation of natural gas and crude oil exploration and production our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
they include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  submitting and implementing spill prevention plans  submitting notification relating to the presence  use and release of certain contaminants incidental to oil and gas operations  as required under epa emergency planning and community right to know act epcra regulations  regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the use  transportation  storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities  submitting air permit applications for agency review and possible issuance of operating permits  compliance with epa resource conservation and recovery act rcra requirements  and regulating surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production 
our operations are also subject to various conservation matters  including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases  which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties 
in addition  certain state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
in addition  various federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment  the generation  storage  transportation and disposal of contaminants and the protection of public health  natural resources  wildlife and environment affect our exploration  development and production operations and our related costs 
other properties in addition to the other properties described herein  we own an eight story office building in rapid city  south dakota with approximately  square feet  of which we occupy approximately percent and lease the remainder to others 
also in rapid city  we own two additional office buildings consisting of an aggregate of approximately  square feet and two warehouse buildings consisting of an aggregate of approximately  square feet 
in cheyenne  wyoming  we own a business office with approximately  square feet  and a service center and garage with an aggregate of approximately  square feet 
we lease an aggregate of  square feet of office space in golden  colorado 
employees at february   we had full time employees 
we have experienced no labor stoppages or significant labor disputes at our facilities 
the following table sets forth the number of employees by business number of employees corporate wholesale energy group black hills power clf p communications total these employees are currently employed by black hills corporation 
in connection with our registration as a holding company under puhca  most of these employees will be transferred to black hills services company  llc  the service company we formed to comply with the rules  regulations and orders of the sec under puhca 
approximately percent of our black hills power employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers local  which expires on march  approximately percent of our clf p employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers local  which expires on june  risk factors the following specific risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed from time to time with the sec should be considered for a better understanding of our company 
these factors and other matters discussed herein are important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements included elsewhere in this document 
we must rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make debt payments 
puhca restricts our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us  and there may be changes in the regulatory environment that restrict future dividends from our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets 
consequently  our operating cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose  whether by dividends or otherwise 
in addition  each subsidiary s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any contractual or regulatory restrictions that may be applicable to it  which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash  working capital or debt service funds 
our utility operations are regulated by utility commissions in the states of south dakota  wyoming and montana 
these commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met and that we maintain a reasonable capital structure 
as a result of the energy crisis in california and the financial troubles at a number of energy companies  some state utility commissions have imposed restrictions on the ability of the utilities they regulate to pay dividends or make advances to their parent holding companies 
if the utility commissions in south dakota or wyoming choose to adopt similar restrictions  our utilities ability to pay dividends or advance funds to us would be limited  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations 
additionally  puhca  with limited exception  only permits the payments of dividends to us by our utility subsidiaries out of earned surplus 
the sec has authorized our non utility subsidiaries to pay dividends out of capital or unearned surplus only where our non utility subsidiary has received excess cash as a result of the sale of some or all of its assets  has engaged in a restructuring or reorganization  and or is returning capital to an associate company 
we cannot assure you that our results from the acquisition and integration of clf p will conform to our expectations 
there may be additional risks associated with the operation of clf p 
we cannot assure you that our actual results from the acquisition of clf p will match our expectations 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control and are inherently uncertain 
factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expected results include the actions of the wpsc in response to clf p s pursuit of cost recovery in gas and electric cost adjustment filings and other rate proceedings  the loss of clf p management or key personnel  the diversion of our management s attention from other business segments  and labor issues associated with clf p s union contract 
our agreements with counterparties that have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings expose us to the risk of counterparty default  which could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
we are exposed to credit risks in our power generation  distribution and energy marketing operations 
credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations 
in the past several years  a substantial number of energy companies have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings  some of which serve as our counterparties from time to time 
in particular  the credit rating of the senior unsecured debt of nevada power company  a counterparty under tolling and qf agreements with our subsidiaries  is non investment grade 
in addition  we have project level financing arrangements in place that provide for the potential acceleration of payment obligations in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty under related power purchase agreements 
if these or other counterparties fail to perform their obligations under their respective power purchase agreements  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to enter into replacement power purchase agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements  or at all 
if we were unable to enter into replacement power purchase agreements  we would sell the plant s power at market prices 
our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future 
if this were to occur  our access to capital and our cost of capital and other costs would be negatively affected 
our issuer credit rating is baa by moody s investor services  inc  or moody s  and bbb by standard poor s rating service 
any reduction in our ratings by moody s or standard poor s would reduce our credit rating to non investment grade status  and such reduction could adversely affect our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  a further downgrade in our credit rating would increase our costs of borrowing under some of our existing debt obligations  including borrowings made under our revolving credit facilities  our million wygen plant project financing  and our million and million secured financings 
a downgrade could also result in our business counterparties requiring us to provide additional amounts of collateral under existing or new transactions 
geopolitical tensions may impair our ability to raise capital and limit our growth 
continuing conflict in iraq or further tensions with the governments of iran or north korea could disrupt capital markets and make it more costly or temporarily impossible for us to raise capital  thus hampering the implementation of our stated strategy 
in the past  geopolitical events  including the uncertainty associated with the gulf war in and the terrorist attacks of september   have been associated with general economic slowdowns 
geopolitical tensions or other factors could retard economic growth and reduce demand for the power and fuel products that we produce or market  which could adversely affect our earnings 
our utilities may not raise their retail rates without prior approval of the south dakota public utilities commission or the wyoming public services commission 
if either utility seeks rate relief  it could experience delays in obtaining approvals and could have rate recovery disallowed in rate proceedings 
our rate freeze agreement with the sdpuc for our black hills power electric utility expired on january  until such time as we petition the sdpuc or the wpsc for rate relief  or either commission requires that we do so  neither black hills power nor clf p may increase its retail rates 
additionally  black hills power may not invoke any fuel and purchased power adjustment tariff that would take effect prior to the completion of a rate proceeding  absent extraordinary circumstances 
as part of the process for obtaining approval to acquire clf p  we agreed with the wpsc that clf p and black hills power would not raise retail rates for their respective wyoming customers prior to january  because our utilities are generally unable to increase their base rates without prior approval from the sdpuc and the wpsc  our returns could be threatened by plant outages  machinery failure  increases in purchased power costs over which our utilities have no control  acts of nature  acts of terrorism or other unexpected events that could cause operating costs to increase and operating margins to decline 
moreover  in the event of unexpected plant outages or machinery failures  black hills power may be required to purchase replacement power in wholesale power markets at prices that exceed the rates it is permitted to charge its retail customers 
finally  our utilities costs would be subject to the review of the sdpuc or the wpsc  and the commissions could find certain costs not to be recoverable  thus negatively affecting our revenues 
because prices for our products and services and other operating costs for our business are volatile  our revenues and expenses may fluctuate 
a substantial portion of our net income in recent years has been attributable to sales of wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market 
the prices of energy products in the wholesale power markets have stabilized at lower levels after the price volatility experienced in the second half of and the first half of power prices are influenced by many factors outside our control  including fuel prices  transmission constraints  supply and demand  weather  economic conditions  and the rules  regulations and actions of the system operators in those markets 
moreover  unlike most other commodities  electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use 
as a result  wholesale power markets are subject to significant price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable 
the success of our oil and gas operations will depend somewhat upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have also been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
a decrease in oil or natural gas prices will not only reduce revenues and profits  but will also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the value of these assets 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
a decline in fuel price volatility could also affect our revenues and returns from energy marketing  which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile 
our broadband communications business is subject to significant competition for its services and to rapid technological change 
our communications segment  which provides a suite of communication services  faces strong competition for its services from the incumbent local exchange carrier and from long distance providers  cellular providers  satellite providers  internet service providers  the incumbent cable television provider and others 
our ability to recover our capital investment is dependent on our ability to sustain our customer base and is subject to the risk that technological advances may render our network obsolete 
if we determine that we will be unable to recover our investment  we would be required to take a non cash charge to earnings in an amount that could be material in order to write down a portion of our investment in our broadband communications business 
construction  expansion  refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource recovery facilities involve significant risks which could lead to lost revenues or increased expenses 
the construction  expansion  refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource recovery facilities involve many risks  including the inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals  the unavailability of equipment  supply interruptions  work stoppages  labor disputes  social unrest  weather interferences  unforeseen engineering  environmental and geological problems  and unanticipated cost overruns 
the ongoing operation of our facilities involves all of the risks described above  in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
new plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment  especially in the case of newer environmental emission control technology 
any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels  which in turn could result in lost revenues  increased expenses  higher maintenance costs and penalties 
while we maintain insurance  obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels  the proceeds of such insurance  and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damage payments 
our power project development  expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful  which would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 
the growth of our independent power business through development  expansion and acquisition activities is important to our future growth 
we may not be able to continue to develop attractive opportunities or to complete acquisitions or development projects we undertake 
factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include competition  the trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements  lower than anticipated increases in the demand for power in our target markets  fuel prices or fuel supply constraints  transmission constraints  changes in federal or state laws and regulations  our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition  construction  fuel supply  power sales or other material agreements  our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals  capital market conditions  and our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire 
estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretations and judgment  and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and prices for oil and natural gas 
actual prices  production  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates  and these variances may be significant 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from our estimates 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production and changes in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions 
estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves 
the process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserves 
the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretations and judgment of known data  assumptions used regarding structural limits and mining extents  conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery  and undetected deposit anomalies 
variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates 
in addition  future environmental  economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that can result in reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates 
our business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and permitting requirements as well as on site environmental liabilities we assumed when we acquired some of our facilities 
we may be adversely affected by any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements or the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements 
our business is subject to extensive energy  environmental and other laws and regulations of federal  state and local authorities 
we generally are required to obtain and comply with a wide variety of licenses  permits and other approvals in order to operate our facilities 
in the course of complying with these requirements  we may incur significant additional costs 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of liens or fines 
in addition  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in laws and regulation may have a detrimental effect on our business 
in acquiring some of our facilities  we assumed on site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of those facilities  regardless of when such liabilities arose and whether known or unknown  and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those facilities for on site environmental liabilities 
we strive at all times to be in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  steps to bring our facilities into compliance  if necessary  could be expensive  and thus could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
furthermore  with the continuing trends toward stricter standards  greater regulation  more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the assets we operate  we expect our environmental expenditures to be substantial in the future 
results from class action litigation and other proceedings regarding reporting of natural gas trading information could adversely affect our business 
in march  we received a request for information from the commodity futures trading commission  or cftc  requesting that we produce  among other things  all documents relating to natural gas and electricity trading in connection with the cftc s industry wide investigation of trade and trade reporting practices of power and natural gas trading companies 
we cooperated fully with the cftc producing documents and other materials in response to more specific requests relating to the reporting of natural gas trading information to energy industry publications  conducted our own internal investigation into the accuracy of information that former employees of enserco energy inc  our gas marketing subsidiary  voluntarily reported to trade publications  and provided detailed reports of our investigation to the cftc 
in july  we reached a settlement with the cftc on this investigation  whereby we agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of million 
subsequent to the settlement of the cftc investigation  several parties filed putative class action suits against numerous companies in the natural gas marketing industry  including us 
although we paid a civil monetary penalty in the cftc action  we cannot guarantee that other legal proceedings  other civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other regulatory action related to this issue will not occur which  in turn  could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
ongoing changes in the united states utility industry  such as state and federal regulatory changes  a potential increase in the number of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility  could adversely affect our profitability 
the united states electric utility industry is currently experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of consumer demands  technological advances  deregulation  greater availability of natural gas fired power generation  and other factors 
ferc has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non utility purchasers and sellers of electricity 
in addition  a number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition 
industry deregulation in some states has led to the disaggregation of some vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission and distribution businesses  and deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation 
as a result  significant additional competitors could become active in the generation  transmission and distribution segments of our industry  which could negatively affect our ability to expand our asset base 
in addition  the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed  and may in the future continue to impose  price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets 
these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of those generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets 
given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long term price history in some of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators  we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets

part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol bkh 
as of january   we had  common shareholders of record and approximately  beneficial owners  representing all states  the district of columbia and foreign countries 
we have paid a regular quarterly cash dividend each year since the incorporation of our predecessor company in and expect to continue paying a regular quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future 
at its january meeting  our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to per share  equivalent to an annual dividend of per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities  restrictions under puhca and our future business prospects 
our credit facilities contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends  the most restrictive of which prohibit the payment of cash dividends if our fixed charge coverage ratio  as calculated in our credit agreements  is less than  our recourse leverage ratio exceeds or our consolidated net worth does not exceed the sum of million and percent of our aggregate consolidated net income since april  in addition  under puhca  unless there is an order from the sec  a holding company or any subsidiary may only declare and pay dividends out of retained earnings 
as part of the order approving our public utility holding company  we agreed that the consolidated company and the utility subsidiaries will maintain at least a percent common equity ratio

as discontinued operations in items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and and a results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a diversified energy holding company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups wholesale energy and retail services 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment wholesale energy group power generation oil and gas coal mining energy marketing and transportation retail services group electric utility communications our wholesale energy group  which operates through black hills energy  inc and its subsidiaries  engages in the production of electric power through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under long term tolling contracts  the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  and the marketing and transportation of fuel products 
our retail services group currently consists of our electric utility  black hills power  and communications segments 
in future filings  we will report the operations of our new combination electric and gas public utility  clf p  as its own segment 
our electric utility  black hills power  inc  generates  transmits and distributes electricity to an average of approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming and montana 
our communications segment provides broadband telecommunication services to approximately  residential and business customers in rapid city and the northern black hills region of south dakota through black hills fibercom  llc 
in may  we sold our subsidiary  landrica development corp  which held some land and coal enhancement facilities that were previously reported in our coal mining segment 
in  we decided to divest of our non strategic power generation assets located in the northeastern united states 
on september   we sold our seven hydroelectric power plants located in upstate new york 
we currently hold for sale our megawatt pepperell power plant in massachusetts 
in  we discontinued operations of our coal marketing business due to difficulties in marketing our wyodak coal from the powder river basin of wyoming to east coast markets 
the non strategic assets were sold effective august  industry overview the energy and telecommunications industries are expected to become increasingly competitive due to a variety of regulatory  economic and technological changes 
in addition  the energy sector has become more volatile due to international tensions  changes in investment activity and factors affecting supply and demand of various energy resources 
in recent years  state and federal regulators have been evaluating the results of energy deregulation efforts of the s 
these efforts were intended to encourage competition  introduce consumer choice and attract additional investment in energy resources 
in many states  electric utilities were required to disaggregate traditional functions of generation  transmission  distribution and marketing of electricity in an effort to open markets to competition 
due to a number of causes  energy consumers have been exposed to significant price increases and deterioration in service in recent years 
because the benefits of a more competitive industry were not always evident  many regulators are now seeking new policy directions to assure greater reliability and end user value in the future 
a surge in investment in gas fired power generation facilities occurred in the early s 
some of that investment led to an overabundance of power capacity in certain regions of the country 
in some instances  merchant or non contracted plants became financially distressed as market prices for power fell below the cost of production for extended periods during the time frame 
many of these plants were deemed impaired and asset values were written down 
several companies abandoned their independent power production ipp strategy  sold their plants and exited the sector 
ipp facilities under contract with utilities have fared better than those subject to volatile market conditions 
mild weather over vast sections of the us in and  combined with slower regional economic growth  contributed to a slowdown in electric energy demand nationwide 
as a result of excess energy supply  wholesale power prices have been relatively soft for much of the last two years 
this situation could turn around abruptly with a resurgence of hotter than normal weather during the summer peaking season and increases in industrial demand 
in addition  the availability of hydroelectric power is unpredictable and dependent on precipitation in the northwestern us power prices in the west can be affected dramatically by changing hydroelectric conditions 
the energy industry experienced a financial crisis beginning in late  stemming from the collapse of enron corporation and the near collapse of several other leading energy companies 
the aggregate market capitalization of energy companies fell on the scale of hundreds of billions of dollars  reflecting challenging market conditions and investor attitudes 
investors and consumers lost confidence in the financial health and future prospects of many energy providers as a result of numerous events 
accordingly  energy companies have been subject to much greater scrutiny by regulators  credit rating agencies and investors 
in response  companies are moving aggressively to improve liquidity and to restructure their balance sheets 
they are abandoning unsuccessful business strategies  selling non core assets  downsizing staffs  issuing new equity  canceling acquisitions  postponing or canceling construction projects  reducing significant levels of capital expenditures  accelerating debt repayment and realigning trading activities around their own generation  mid stream and transportation assets 
the oil and gas industry has experienced significant price volatility in the past several years  from a lower price environment in and to significantly higher prices for both commodities in and to date 
in the s  natural gas has emerged as the national industrial fuel of choice 
most of the recent increase in power generation capacity has been gas fired  which in turn has exposed the generation companies financial performance to greater risk due to fuel price volatility 
recent high product prices have encouraged domestic oil and gas producers to increase production and reserves 
in addition  investment in liquefied natural gas port facilities is expected to increase the availability of gas supplies in future years 
the us coal industry has experienced a resurgence in the past two years  with favorable commodity prices creating attractive returns 
coal prices in wyoming s powder river basin have increased moderately during this period  due to the coal s lower heat content and high transportation costs 
those factors limit the ability to capture significant additional market share 
however  from a regional perspective  powder river basin coal can be a very competitive energy resource 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be an international policy issue  with opponents arguing environmental harm  despite the application of advanced emissions technology 
because coal continues to be an economical resource  its long term prospects as an important component of a national energy mix remain strong 
the telecommunications industry underwent widespread changes brought about by  among other things  the telecommunications act of and the decisions of federal and state regulators to open the monopolistic local telephone and cable television markets to competition 
the industry has also experienced the rapid introduction of new broadband technology applications and increased consumer demand for faster  higher capacity  digital based and expanded broadband communications services  including broader video choices and high speed data and internet services 
the convergence of these trends allowed many new entrants into the telecommunications market 
due to the rapid expansion of the broadband industry and the effects of technical substitution and obsolescence of equipment  the broadband communications industry s financial performance has suffered in many us markets 
business strategy we are a customer focused energy provider 
our business is comprised of fuel assets  electric generation assets and retail utility assets  such as electric and gas distribution systems 
to optimize the value of those assets  we utilize our energy marketing and transportation expertise 
our focus on customers  whether retail utility customers or wholesale generation or marketing customers  provides us with opportunities to expand our various businesses 
the diversity of our operations avoids reliance on any single business to achieve our strategic objectives 
this diversity is expected to provide a measure of stability to our business and financial performance in volatile or cyclical periods 
it should help us reduce our total corporate risk and allow us to achieve higher than average market returns over the long term 
the strength and stability of our balance sheet is critical in today s market 
access to capital  sufficient liquidity and quality of earnings are our key drivers 
our balanced  integrated approach to fuel production  power generation  retail operations and energy marketing is supported by disciplined risk management practices 
additionally  building on the strength of our electric utility  black hills power  we enhanced our black hills area operations by providing broadband communications to our customers in south dakota 
our long term strategy is to continue growing our core retail utility  generation and fuel asset businesses  supplemented by our energy marketing and transportation operations 
we will do this primarily by focusing on customers 
in the retail area  we will focus on acquiring new customers through the acquisition of additional retail utility properties  while maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards 
in the power generation area  we will focus on long term contractual relationships with key wholesale customers  as well as new customers  to allow us to expand existing generation sites  or to construct or acquire new generation facilities 
finally  in the fuel area  we will strive to develop additional markets for our production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
the expertise of our energy marketing and transportation businesses will continue to enable us to optimize the value of our asset businesses 
the following are key elements of our business strategy operate our lines of business as retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component consists of electric  natural gas and telecommunications products and services 
the wholesale component consists of fuel production  marketing  mid stream assets and power production facilities  preserve black hills power s low cost rate structure for our residential  commercial and industrial customers while retaining the flexibility to selectively market excess generating capacity off system to maximize returns in changing market environments  expand retail operations through selective acquisitions of electric utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  improve our communications business by increasing customer service and value  by increasing revenues and by creating additional operating efficiencies  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale energy customers  conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties  sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from new independent power projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns  grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce power at attractive margins  increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our overall fuel production  increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales  grow our energy marketing operations primarily through the expansion of producer and end use origination services  and manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure 
operate our lines of business as retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component consists of electric and telecommunications products and services 
the wholesale component consists of fuel production  marketing  mid stream assets and power production facilities 
through the retail and wholesale groups of our business  operating efficiencies are achieved 
in the retail group  the integration of customer service and marketing and promotional efforts streamline operating processes and improve productivity 
in the wholesale group  the fuel production  marketing and generation segments integrate balanced  yet diverse strategic operations 
preserve black hills power s low cost rate structure for our residential  commercial and industrial customers while retaining the flexibility to selectively market excess generating capacity off system to maximize returns in changing market environments 
through a settlement with the sdpuc black hills power has been under a retail rate freeze since the rate freeze agreement terminated on january  the rate freeze preserved black hills power s low cost rate structure at levels below the national average for our retail customers while allowing us to retain the benefits from cost savings and wholesale off system sales 
this has provided us with flexibility in allocating black hills power s generating capacity to maximize returns in changing market environments 
we have historically optimized the utilization of black hills power s power supply resources by selling wholesale power to other utilities and to power marketers in the spot market and through short term sales contracts 
absent any request for a rate change by us or the sdpuc  rates will remain unchanged from those in place during the rate freeze 
expand retail operations through selective acquisitions of electric utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for more than years  we have provided strong retail services  based on delivering quality and value to our customers 
that tradition and accomplishment is expected to support efforts to expand our retail operations in other markets  most likely in the west and in regions that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation and system reliability 
the january acquisition of clf p is an example of these expansion efforts 
retail operations also can augment other important business development  including transmission and pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could lead to advancing other wholesale operations 
regulated retail operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows and earnings 
improve our communications business by increasing customer service and value  by increasing revenues  and by creating additional operating efficiencies 
we are now the leading provider of telephone  cable television and high speed internet services in the areas we serve 
this accomplishment was initially due to the strength of black hills power s reputation for reliability  customer service and value 
more recently  our improvement in operations is due primarily to our service deliverability  reliability and commitment to our broadband customers 
we believe this dual strategy upholding our strong public standing and delivering superior broadband communications products and services will advance our efforts further in the future 
as we continue to seek additional customers and revenue  we will also continue efforts to create operating efficiencies by integrating appropriate business functions with related utility operations  benefiting customers as well as both business segments 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale energy customers 
we strive to build strong relationships with utilities  municipalities and other wholesale customers  who we believe will continue to be the primary providers of electricity to retail customers in a deregulated environment 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to serve their customers reliably 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to meet our customers energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into the more volatile spot markets 
conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties 
our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we accomplish this by establishment of counterparty credit limits  continuous credit monitoring  and regular review of compliance with our credit policy by our executive credit committee that reports to our board of directors 
sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from new independent power projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns 
by selling the majority of our energy and capacity under mid and long term contracts  we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
our goal is to sell a substantial majority of our unregulated power generation assets under long term pre approved contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets  and in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development 
we aim to develop power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and fuel and energy marketing capabilities 
this approach seeks to capitalize on market growth while managing our fuel procurement needs 
over the next few years  we intend to grow through a combination of disciplined acquisitions and development of new power generation facilities primarily in the western regions where we believe we have the detailed knowledge of market fundamentals and competitive advantage to achieve attractive returns 
we believe the following trends will provide us with growth opportunities in the future demand for electricity in certain western regions is expected to grow and new generation capacity will be required over the next several years 
new electric generation construction will be predominantly gas fired  which may create further competitive cost advantages for new and existing coal fired generation assets 
transmission construction will significantly lag new generation development  favoring new development located near load centers or existing  unconstrained transmission locations 
disaggregation of the electric utility industry from traditionally vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission  distribution and marketing entities may continue in certain regions  thereby creating opportunities for expansions  acquisitions and joint ventures 
we believe that existing sites with opportunities for brownfield expansion generally offer the potential for greater returns than development of new sites through a greenfield strategy 
brownfield sites typically offer several competitive advantages over greenfield development  including proximity to existing transmission systems  operating cost advantages related to ownership of shared facilities  a less costly and time consuming permitting process  and potential ability to reduce capital requirements by sharing infrastructure with existing facilities at the same site 
we expanded our capacity with brownfield development at our valmont and wyodak sites in  arapahoe and las vegas sites in and our wyodak site in we believe that our fountain valley  wyodak and las vegas sites in particular provide further opportunities for significant expansion of our gas and coal fired generating capacity over the next several years 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce power at attractive margins 
we expect to expand our portfolio of power plants having relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
as an increasing number of gas fired power plants are brought into operation  we intend to utilize a low cost power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to protect our revenue stream 
low marginal production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving very low production costs 
our primary competitive advantage is our coal mine  which is located in close proximity to our retail service territories 
we are exploiting the competitive advantage of this native fuel source by building additional mine mouth coal fired generating capacity 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer since transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal 
increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our overall fuel production 
our strategy is to expand our natural gas reserves through a combination of acquisitions and drilling programs 
we aim to maintain sufficient natural gas production either to directly serve or indirectly hedge the fuel cost exposure of our gas fired generation plants 
specifically  we plan to substantially increase our natural gas reserves while minimizing exploration risk by focusing on lower risk exploration and development drilling as well as acquisitions of proven reserves  exploit opportunities based on our belief that the long term demand for natural gas will remain strong by emphasizing natural gas in our acquisition and drilling activities  and add natural gas reserves and increase production by focusing primarily on various shallow gas plays in the rocky mountain region  where the added production can be integrated with our fuel marketing and or power generation activities 
increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales 
our strategy is to expand our coal production through the construction of mine mouth coal fired generation plants at our wyodak mine location 
our objective is to maintain coal reserves to serve our mine mouth coal fired generation plants directly 
specifically  we plan to increase coal production and sales from our wyodak mine by continuing to develop additional mine mouth generating facilities at the site  and pursue future sales of coal from the wyodak mine to regional additional rail served and truck served customers 
grow our energy marketing operations primarily through the expansion of producer and end use origination services 
our energy marketing activities distinguish themselves from other marketing businesses by focusing on customer services and the physical delivery of energy commodities 
with our producer services  we primarily assist natural gas producers in the rocky mountain region of the us and canada with marketing and transporting their commodities to the marketplace 
we also provide origination services  where we work with industrial consumers of natural gas  by sourcing and arranging delivery for gas 
we expect  because of our regional marketing expertise and proven knowledge of efficiently utilizing storage and transportation infrastructure  that we can increase our marketing volumes as well as provide services to optimize the value of our fuel and generation assets 
in the future  we may acquire additional mid stream assets  such as regional pipelines and storage systems  so that we can facilitate and further augment our marketing services 
manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure 
our energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we have implemented risk management policies and procedures for each of our marketing companies that establish price risk exposure levels 
we formed oversight committees to monitor compliance with our policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining separate credit facilities for each of our marketing companies 
prospective information we continue to advance our business strategy 
we expect long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continued capital deployment 
we believe that we are strategically positioned to take advantage of opportunities to acquire and develop energy assets consistent with our investment criteria and a prudent capital structure 
our wholesale energy group was our largest contributor to revenue and earnings in and we expect that earnings from this group over the next few years will be driven primarily by increased oil and gas production and expansion in power generation 
in march we acquired mallon resources corporation  an energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploration  development and production primarily in the san juan basin of new mexico 
this acquisition more than doubled our reserves  and contributed to a percent increase in production volumes compared to levels 
although we expect long term growth in our power generation segment  power generation earnings are expected to return to a more normalized earnings profile due to the new las vegas cogeneration ii contract with nevada power company that began april  we expect lower earnings from our energy marketing and transportation segment due to anticipated decreases in oil marketing and transportation revenue  and lower margins from gas marketing 
firm electric business at our electric utility  black hills power  remained healthy in we believe that black hills power will produce modest growth in revenue  and absent unplanned plant outages  it will continue to produce stable earnings for the next several years 
we forecast firm energy sales in our retail service territory to increase over the next years at an annual compound growth rate of approximately one percent  with the system demand forecasted to increase at a rate of two percent 
these forecasts are derived from studies conducted by us whereby we examined and analyzed our service territory to estimate changes in the needs for electrical energy and demand over a year period 
these forecasts are only estimates  and the actual changes in electric sales may be substantially different 
weather deviations can also affect energy sales significantly when compared to forecasts based on normal weather 
the portion of the utility s future earnings that will result from wholesale off system sales will depend on many factors  including native load growth  plant availability  electricity demand and commodity prices 
on january   the south dakota retail rate freeze under which black hills power has operated since january   expired 
the current south dakota retail electric rates  along with the wyoming retail electric rates  have been in place since the summer of these rates  which have remained flat for years  do not include a fuel and or purchased power adjustment clause but allow black hills power to retain the benefits of off system wholesale sales and cost reductions 
black hills power has no current plans to request approval to change its retail electric rates 
black hills power s return is affected by changes in inflation  capital investment  capital markets  and retail and wholesale power sales 
black hills power monitors these potential impacts in order to ensure that its return remains adequate for its investment to serve customers 
in january we acquired cheyenne light  fuel power clf p from xcel energy inc clf p is a utility serving residential  commercial and industrial energy consumers in and around cheyenne  wyoming 
currently the utility has approximately  electric customers and  gas customers 
its peak load is megawatts and power is provided under an all requirements contract with psco  which extends through clf p s annual natural gas sales and transportation during were approximately million mmbtus  with sales to commercial and residential customers accounting for approximately million mmbtus and transportation accounting for approximately million mmbtus 
we anticipate modest accretion to earnings from the clf p acquisition in a condition of the settlement stipulation approved by the wpsc when it authorized black hills corporation to acquire clf p prohibits us from increasing clf p s gas or electric base rates prior to january  clf p s rates are separated into commodity energy related charges and charges that recover the costs of operating the natural gas and electric distribution systems base rates 
the commodity energy costs are forecasted annually for recovery on a current basis from customers 
also included for recovery refund are any over or under collections  plus interest  occurring during the prior year 
another condition of the settlement stipulation is that clf p is required to file with the wpsc an updated resource plan prior to june  the resource plan will provide information regarding the options being considered for meeting its electricity requirements after december   when the current all requirements power supply agreement with psco expires 
we expect improved results from our broadband communications business in due to increased revenues and continued improvement in cost containment measures 
integration of certain retail functions will improve customer service and productivity 
the recovery of our capital investment and future profitability are dependent primarily on our ability to sustain our customer base and control our expenses  and is subject to the risk of market competition and the risk that technological advances may render our network obsolete 
if we determine that we will be unable to recover our investment  we would be required to record a non cash charge to earnings  in an amount that could be material  in order to write down a portion of our investment 
while we do not anticipate being regulated in the local markets  we are unable to predict future markets  future government impositions or future economic and competitive conditions that could affect the profitability of our communications operations 
part of our long term growth strategy includes continued capital deployment

results of operations consolidated results overview revenue and income loss from continuing operations provided by each business group as a percentage of our total revenue and net income were as follows revenue wholesale energy retail services income loss from continuing operations wholesale energy retail services corporate in may  we sold our subsidiary  landrica development corp  which held some land and coal enhancement facilities that were previously reported in our coal mining segment 
in  we sold our hydroelectric power plants located in upstate new york 
the non strategic assets were sold effective september  we also developed a plan of sale for our mw pepperell power plant  our last power plant in the eastern region 
these discontinued operations were previously reported in the power generation segment 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to dispose of our coal marketing subsidiary  black hills coal network  due primarily to difficulties in marketing our wyodak coal from the powder river basin of wyoming to midwestern and eastern coal markets 
we sold the non strategic assets effective august  these discontinued operations were previously reported in the energy marketing and transportation segment

the wholesale energy group s income from continuing operations decreased million in compared to increased income from continuing operations of million at our oil and gas operations and million from energy marketing and transportation operations were offset by decreased earnings from power generation of million and from coal mining of million 
the retail services group s income from continuing operations decreased million in compared to earnings from continuing operations from the electric utility decreased million due to lower margins received  increased maintenance expense and general and administrative costs  offset by lower interest expense 
the communication segment s losses decreased million in compared to due to increased revenues and lower operating costs  offset by increased marketing costs and corporate cost allocations 
corporate costs for the year ended december  decreased million after tax  compared to the decrease is primarily due to increased allocations to subsidiaries and a million pre tax gain on sale of assets  partially offset by increased costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and holding company structuring and higher pension  insurance and interest expense 
the company s subsidiary  daksoft  inc  recorded a million pre tax gain on the sale of its campground reservation system

the earnings per share results were impacted by an approximate percent increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding primarily related to the dilutive effect of the april common stock offering in which million shares were issued 
in addition  results for included the impact of several non recurring items that had a net effect of decreasing results by approximately million after tax 
these items included a million after tax charge in our energy marketing and transportation segment for a settlement with the commodity futures trading commission cftc  a net after tax charge of million in our power generation segment for the impact of a million contract termination payment received at the las vegas ii plant  offset by the related million impairment charge taken on that plant  a million after tax benefit for unrealized gains on plant investments accounted for on a fair value method of accounting at our equity method power funds  a million after tax benefit from a legal settlement at our las vegas ii plant  and a million after tax benefit from an enron bankruptcy settlement 
in addition  results were affected by a non recurring million after tax benefit for the collection of previously reserved amounts at our power generation segment 
corporate costs for the year ended december  increased million after tax  compared to the increase was primarily due to a million net increase in interest expense  increased healthcare costs and corporate tax expense 
net interest costs increased due to increased borrowings from the million debt issuance in may and the low returns on short term investments 
discussion of results from our operating groups and segments is included in the following pages

income from continuing operations from our energy marketing and transportation businesses increased million due to increased gas marketing volumes and higher margins received and increased oil transportation revenues and oil marketing margins 
these increases were partially offset by unrealized mark to market losses of million  pre tax 
oil and gas income from continuing operations increased million due to a percent increase in volumes sold and an increase in sales prices for oil and gas  partially offset by increased production expenses 
coal mining income from continuing operations decreased million due to a decrease in revenues resulting from scheduled and unscheduled plant outages  and higher depreciation expense  offset by lower general and administrative and direct mining costs 
in addition  results were million lower due to the impact of several non recurring items as noted below

these items include a million after tax charge in our energy marketing and transportation segment for a settlement with the commodity futures trading commission cftc  a net after tax charge of million in our power generation segment for the impact of a million contract termination payment received at the las vegas ii plant  offset by the related million impairment charge taken on that plant  a million after tax benefit for unrealized gains on plant investments accounted for on a fair value method of accounting at our equity method power funds  a million after tax benefit from a legal settlement at our las vegas ii plant  and a million after tax benefit from an enron bankruptcy settlement 
in addition  results were affected by a non recurring million after tax benefit for the collection of previously reserved amounts at our power generation segment 
power generation segment income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in  primarily due to earnings from megawatts of additional capacity that was placed into service early in  partially offset by increased related operating  interest and depreciation costs and fourth quarter losses at the megawatt las vegas ii plant as prevailing regional power market conditions limited the economic dispatch subsequent to the termination of the plant s long term contract 
income from continuing operations from our energy marketing and transportation businesses decreased to million in  compared to million in primarily due to the cftc settlement and a percent decrease in natural gas margins received  partially offset by a percent increase in natural gas volumes marketed and increased earnings from oil pipelines 
oil and gas income from continuing operations increased to million in compared to million in results improved due to a percent increase in volumes sold  primarily related to the march acquisition of mallon resources  and higher prices received during  partially offset by higher depletion and operating costs 
coal mining income from continuing operations in increased to million compared to million in  due to a percent increase in tons sold  which was partially offset by higher general and administrative and direct mining costs related to the increased production volumes 
power generation our power generation segment produced the following results in thousands revenue operating income income from continuing operations power generation revenue in includes million of contract termination revenue see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
independent power capacity mws of independent power capacity in service b a mws of independent power capacity under construction a includes the mw expansion at the las vegas ii power plant which was placed into service on january  b capacity in service includes megawatt pepperell and hydroelectric in  which is reported as discontinued operations 
compared to power generation segment income from continuing operations decreased to million in from million in earnings decreased primarily as the result of lower earnings at our las vegas ii plant 
during the first quarter of  prevailing regional power market conditions limited the economic dispatch of this plant subsequent to the termination of the plant s long term contract in september  and for the remainder of the year  lower contract rates on the new long term contract 
the lower revenue was partially offset by lower depreciation expense at that plant 
the decline in segment earnings was also due to higher fuel costs at las vegas i  lower revenues at our harbor plant  offset by lower fuel cost  due to the expiration of a summer peaking agreement  and higher interest expense due to the december  consolidation of our wygen plant 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased million after tax primarily due to the impact of mark to market adjustments at certain power fund investments that use a fair value method of accounting 
these items were partially offset by lower fuel costs at our gillette combustion turbine  a benefit from certain tax adjustments  lower interest expense due to the pay down of debt  and higher earnings from other revenues 
in addition  the segment s earnings were affected by certain non recurring items  netting to a benefit of approximately million after tax 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million in compared to primarily due to increased generation capacity in operation  partially offset by related increases in interest  depreciation  fuel and other operating costs 
the increase in income was partially offset by fourth quarter losses at the megawatt las vegas ii plant as the prevailing regional power market conditions limited the economic dispatch subsequent to the termination of the plant s long term contract in september in addition  results include several non recurring items that had a net effect of increasing results by million after tax 
these items include a net million after tax charge for the impact of a million contract termination payment at the las vegas ii plant  offset by the related million non cash impairment charge taken on the plant  a million after tax benefit for unrealized gains on plant investments accounted for on a fair value method of accounting at our equity method power fund investments  a million after tax benefit from a legal settlement at our las vegas ii plant  and a million after tax benefit from an enron bankruptcy settlement 
in addition  results were affected by a non recurring million after tax benefit for the collection of previously reserved amounts 
revenue and operating expense increased percent and percent  respectively  over the revenue increase is primarily related to million contract termination revenue and energy sales and capacity payments on the megawatt gas fired las vegas ii plant and the megawatt coal fired wygen plant  both of which went into operation early in and the mw arapahoe expansion completed in the latter part of the las vegas ii plant received capacity and energy payments under a long term contract only through september   the contract termination date 
after the contract termination  the las vegas ii plant sold power into the market only when it was economic to do so 
in december a new long term tolling arrangement was entered into with nevada power company  which became effective april  increased operating expense was primarily due to the million asset impairment charge  related to the contract termination and the increased depreciation  fuel  and other operating costs associated with the additional power plants in operation 
interest expense increased million primarily due to interest costs on plant construction projects  completed in the latter part of and early  being capitalized during construction compared to expensed after the plants became operational 
energy marketing and transportation our energy marketing and transportation companies produced the following results in thousands revenue operating income income from continuing operations all periods presented reflect a net presentation of revenues at our gas marketing subsidiary and a gross presentation of revenues at our crude oil marketing subsidiary in accordance with eitf and eitf the following is a summary of energy marketing average daily volumes natural gas physical sales mmbtus natural gas financial sales mmbtus crude oil barrels compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to a percent increase in natural gas volumes marketed and a percent increase in natural gas margins received 
earnings were also impacted by increased earnings from oil transportation and marketing due to increased transportation revenues and higher marketing margins 
decreased oil marketing revenues were more than offset by lower cost of sales resulting in the higher marketing margins 
these increases were partially offset by unrealized losses recognized through mark to market accounting treatment of million in compared to gains of million in resulting in a year over year decrease of million pre tax 
in addition  earnings were impacted by the million cftc settlement 
compared to income from continuing operations decreased million due to a million after tax charge for the settlement with the cftc and a percent decrease in natural gas margins received  partially offset by a percent increase in natural gas volumes marketed and increased earnings from oil pipelines 
in addition  as a result of changing commodity prices  results were impacted by unrealized gains recognized through mark to market accounting treatment 
unrealized pre tax mark to market gains were million in compared to losses of million in  resulting in a year over year pre tax increase of million 
revenues increased percent from due to a percent increase in average daily volumes of crude oil marketed at average prices percent higher than these higher revenues were substantially offset by increased operating expenses for the purchases of crude oil used in marketing 
oil and gas oil and gas operating results were as follows in thousands revenue operating income income from continuing operations the following is a summary of oil and natural gas production barrels of oil sold mcf of natural gas sold mcf equivalent sales the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves and percent estimated present value of future net revenues discounted using a percent rate  at december barrels of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total in mmcf equivalents present value of estimated future net revenues before tax in thousands these reserves are based on reports prepared by ralph e

reserves were determined using constant product prices at the end of the respective years 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables  which may differ from actual results 
reserves at december  include the march  acquisition of mallon resources corporation 
reserves reflect year end pricing of oil gas oil gas oil gas year end prices nymex year end prices average well head compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to a percent increase in volumes sold  primarily related to a full year of production from properties acquired in the march mallon resources acquisition 
average gas and oil prices received in  including the effects of hedging  were mcf and bbl  respectively  compared to mcf and bbl in total operating expenses increased percent primarily related to increased depletion  production taxes and operating costs associated with the increased production as well as higher corporate cost allocations 
in addition  lease operating expenses per mcfe sold loe mcfe increased percent from per mcfe to per mcfe  and depletion per mcfe sold increased percent from per mcfe to per mcfe

coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue operating income income from continuing operations the following is a summary of coal sales quantities tons of coal sold coal reserves millions of tons compared to income from continuing operations decreased percent as a result of lower revenues due primarily to scheduled and unscheduled plant outages and an increase in depreciation expense partially offset by lower general and administrative and direct mining costs 
decreased coal tons sold were primarily the result of scheduled and unscheduled plant maintenance outages at the wyodak plant partially offset by increased sales to the wygen plant 
in september  the company reached a tax settlement with the wyoming department of revenue  which resulted in an adjustment to coal billings for the period of fourth quarter through the year in  the company recorded a million reduction in revenues and a corresponding reduction in mineral taxes as a result of the settlement 
the company also recorded an additional million decrease to mineral taxes and million decrease to interest expense in related to settlement accruals 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to a percent increase in tons sold  partially offset by a percent decrease in average sales price per ton and an increase in general and administrative and direct mining costs related to the increased production 
increased coal tons sold were the result of sales to our megawatt wygen power plant that became operational in february and additional sales through our train load out facility 
retail services group income from continuing operations for the retail services group decreased million 
earnings from the electric utility segment decreased million  while losses from the communications segment decreased million 
electric utility in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations and net income the following table provides certain electric utility operating statistics firm electric sales mwh wholesale off system mwh we currently have a winter peak load of megawatts established in december and a summer peak load of megawatts established in august we own megawatts of electric utility generating capacity and purchase an additional megawatts under a long term agreement 
compared to electric revenue increased percent in compared to  primarily due to a percent increase in wholesale off system sales offset by decreased transmission revenues due to lower approved rates and higher load share of our open access transmission tariff revenues 
firm kilowatt hour sales decreased percent 
residential and commercial sales decreases of percent and percent  respectively  in accounted for a million decrease in revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in industrial sales 
the percent increase in wholesale off system sales accounted for a million increase in revenues 
revenue per kilowatt hour sold was cents in compared to cents in the number of customers in the service area increased to  in from  in degree days  which is a measure of weather trends  were percent below last year and percent below normal 
electric utility operating expenses increased million due to a million increase in fuel and purchased power cost  a million increase in certain operations and maintenance costs  including scheduled and unscheduled maintenance costs  increased group insurance and corporate allocations and increased costs associated with the increase in wholesale off system sales  partially offset by decreased interest expense of million  primarily due to retirement of debt 
the increase in fuel and purchased power cost was due to an million increase in purchased power costs  offset by a million decrease in fuel costs  as prevailing gas prices made it more economical for us to purchase power for our peaking needs and increased off system sales  rather than generate energy utilizing our gas turbines 
compared to electric revenue increased percent in compared to  primarily due to an percent increase in wholesale off system sales at an average price that was percent higher than the average price in firm kilowatt hour sales increased percent 
residential and commercial sales increases of percent and percent  respectively  in accounted for a million increase in revenue 
the percent increase in wholesale off system sales accounted for a million increase in revenues 
these increases were offset by a percent decrease in industrial sales  primarily due to the closing of homestake mine  which had been one of our largest customers 
revenue per kilowatt hour sold was cents in compared to cents in the number of customers in the service area increased to  in from  in electric utility operating expenses increased million due to a million increase in fuel and purchased power cost  a million increase in certain operations and maintenance costs  including pension expense  a million increase in depreciation expense and a million increase in interest expense due to the full year impact of million of first mortgage bonds issued in august the increase in fuel cost was due to a percent increase in average gas prices for combustion turbine generation facilities and a percent increase in average megawatt hour purchased power costs 
communications in thousands revenue operating expenses operating loss loss from continuing operations and net loss residential customers revenue generating units business customers hybrid fiber coaxial cable miles total revenue generating units rgu equal the total number of services to which residential customers subscribe 
telephone  cable tv and internet access each represent an rgu 
in  reported business customers were adjusted for the consolidation of multiple location business customers  business orders and temporary business access lines 
in september  we formed our broadband communications business to provide facilities based communications services for rapid city and the northern black hills of south dakota 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in state of the art technology that offers local and long distance telephone service  expanded cable television service  internet access  and high speed data and video services 
we began serving communications customers in late and market our services to schools  hospitals  cities  economic development groups  and business and residential customers 
compared to loss from continuing operations was million in compared to million in results for and include our information technology support subsidiary  daksoft  inc beginning in the first quarter of  daksoft s focus became corporate information technology support and therefore its results are now included as corporate costs 
daksoft s results had an insignificant impact on net earnings 
the improved performance  excluding daksoft s results  was due to increased revenues from a larger commercial customer base and increased sales of internet services to residential customers and decreased cost of goods sold and operating costs 
these were partially offset by million in sales incentive costs related to higher marketing campaign costs in response to competitive pressures and an increase in allocated corporate costs 
compared to loss from continuing operations was million in compared to million in the improved performance was due to increased revenues from a larger customer base and an additional million in revenues from a successful directory publication and distribution  partially offset by million in sales incentive costs related to a current marketing campaign in response to competitive pressures 
revenue increases were also partially offset by a million increase in cost of sales and a million increase in depreciation expense 
in addition  results included a million after tax benefit from the collection of previously reserved amounts 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
although we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
in  an impairment charge of approximately million after tax was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the pepperell plant to its estimated fair value  less cost to sell and is included in income from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the consolidated statement of income 
our communications business segment began providing broadband communications services in november and since that time has not achieved profitability 
in each of the last five years  we have evaluated the assets of our communications business segment for impairment  and in each year we determined  based on our assumptions  that the sum of the anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges exceeded the carrying value and  therefore  we did not recognize an impairment 
the carrying value of the assets tested for impairment was approximately million at december  any increases in the anticipated future cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these assets 
if our current estimates of future cash flows from the operation of these assets had been percent lower  we still would not have been required to record an impairment charge 
as a result of the transaction terminating a fifteen year contract with allegheny energy supply company  llc  for capacity and energy at the company s las vegas cogeneration ii power plant  we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of the facility 
the carrying value of the assets tested for impairment was million 
this assessment resulted in a pre tax impairment charge of million to write down the related property  plant and equipment by million  net of accumulated depreciation of million  and intangible assets by million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
this charge reflects the amount by which the carrying value of the facility exceeded its estimated fair value determined by its estimated future discounted cash flows 
in measuring the fair value of the las vegas ii power plant and the resulting impairment charge  we considered a number of possible cash flow models associated with the various probable operating assumptions and pricing for the capacity and energy of the facility 
we then made our best determination of the relative likelihood of the various models in computing a weighted average expected cash flow for the facility 
inclusion of other possible cash flow scenarios and or different weighting of those that were included could have led to different conclusions about the fair value of the plant 
further  the weighted average cash flow method is sensitive to the discount rate assumption 
if we had used a discount rate that was percent higher  the resulting impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
if the discount rate would have been percent lower  the impairment charge would have been approximately million lower 
for long lived assets with indefinite lives  sfas requires an annual impairment test 
upon adopting sfas on january   we completed a transition impairment test in the first quarter of as a result of this impairment test  we recognized a million after tax impairment charge related to the goodwill at our discontinued coal marketing operations 
this impairment charge is reported as part of income from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the consolidated statement of income 
this impairment charge was offset by income of million  after tax  from the write off of negative goodwill at our power generation segment  as required by sfas this amount is reported as change in accounting principles  net of taxes on the consolidated statement of income 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter 
this test did not result in an additional goodwill impairment 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceilings test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas prices at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
although our net capitalized costs were less than the full cost ceiling at december   we cannot assure you that a write down in the future will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
in addition  we rely on an independent consulting and engineering firm to verify the estimates we use to determine the amount of our proved reserves and those estimates are based on a number of assumptions about variables 
we cannot assure you that these assumptions will not differ from actual results 
risk management activities we enter into derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
in addition to the information provided below  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
non trading hedging our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into at our oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary to fix the price received for anticipated future production  and interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
for these and similar transactions  we utilize hedge accounting treatment under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
as cash flow hedges  these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in earnings 
energy trading and marketing our natural gas marketing operations currently fall under the purview of emerging issues task force issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf  sfas  and for contracts entered into before october   in accordance with eitf the current fair values of natural gas trading contracts that qualify as derivatives in accordance with sfas are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and any period to period change in the current fair value of such contracts is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
we have presented the net unrealized and realized gains and losses  whether or not settled financially or physically  from the activities of our natural gas marketing business  in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
for our crude oil marketing operations  substantially all crude oil contracts historically met the definition of energy trading activities under eitf accordingly  all contracts at these operations that originated on or before october  have been accounted for at fair value 
with the adoption of eitf  the contracts at our crude oil marketing operations are no longer recorded at fair value since they do not meet the definition of derivatives or have been exempted from mark to market accounting as normal purchase and normal sales contracts 
these contracts are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting 
valuation fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on listed market prices  where possible 
if market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
counterparty credit risk we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit and tenor limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current financial information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we cannot be assured that our credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
those assumptions  as further described in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements  include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels and healthcare costs 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
defined benefit pension plan we account for our defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions sfas 
in accordance with sfas  changes in pension obligations associated with fluctuations in long term actuarial assumptions may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded non cash expense related to our pension plans of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity securities 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan and weight the returns by applying the assumed rate of return for each asset class to the target allocation for each asset class in the portfolio 
the value of our qualified pension plan assets increased million to million for the plan fiscal year ended september  plan assets earned million in plan assets increased million to million as of september   due to our million contribution to the plan and improved performance of the stock market during plan assets earned million in in the recently completed actuarial valuation  for determining our pension expense  we decreased the assumed rate of return on plan assets from percent to percent 
this change is expected to increase pension costs in and beyond by approximately million per year 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was percent  percent and percent for the  and plan years  respectively 
the percent assumed rate of return for the plan year was determined based on the following estimated long term investment allocations and asset class returns asset class estimated allocation estimated return weighted average return equity fixed income cash the plan s expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is based upon the weighted average expected long term rate of returns for individual asset classes 
the asset class weighting is determined using the target allocation for each asset class in the plan portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return for each asset class is determined primarily from long term historical returns for the asset class  with adjustments if it is anticipated that long term future returns will not achieve historical results 
the expected long term rate of return for equity investments was percent and percent for the and plan years  respectively 
for determining the expected long term rate of return for equity assets  the company reviewed    and year annual returns for the s p index  which were  at december   percent  percent  percent and percent respectively 
fund management fees were estimated to be percent for s p index assets and percent for other assets 
the expected long term rate of return on fixed income investments was percent  the return was based upon historical returns on intermediate term treasury bonds of percent from to the expected long term rate of return on cash investments was estimated to be percent  expected cash returns were estimated to be percent below long term returns on intermediate term treasury bonds 
the discount rate we utilize for determining future benefit obligations is based on high grade bond rates 
the discount rate was decreased to percent for the pension cost determination from percent in a percent decrease in the discount rate would cause annual pension expense to increase by approximately million 
based on our recently completed plan forecasts  we estimate that we will not be required to make cash contributions to the pension plan during the next five years 
actual pension expense and contributions required will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plan 
we will continue to evaluate all of the actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  including the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rate  and will adjust the assumptions as necessary 
non qualified pension plans we have various supplemental retirement plans for our outside directors and key executives 
the plans are nonqualified defined benefit plans accounted for in accordance with sfas expenses recognized under the plans were million in  million in  and million in the plans are unfunded 
the actuarial assumptions used for our non qualified pension plans are the same as those used for our qualified plan 
other postretirement benefits we account for our other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we do not pre fund our other postretirement benefit plan 
our reported costs of providing other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including healthcare cost trends  and result from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
as a result of these factors  significant portions of other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect the actual benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in accordance with sfas actual payments of benefits to retirees during these periods were approximately million per year 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate 
change in assumption impact on december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation impact on service and interest cost in thousands increase decrease in selecting assumed healthcare cost trend rates  we consider recent plan experience and various short and long term cost forecasts for the healthcare industry 
based on these considerations  we changed the healthcare cost trend rate used by the actuaries to determine our other postretirement benefit expense  for and beyond  to percent in decreasing gradually to percent in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption was changed from percent decreasing gradually to percent 
these changes increased the future other postretirement benefit expense included on our income statement by approximately million 
our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits 
see the defined benefit pension plan discussion above regarding our discount rate assumptions 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we were unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december  and  is presented in the following table financial position summary change in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio our dividend payout ratio at december  was approximately percent which is higher than levels over the past years 
based on current expectations for  we expect payout ratios for to be in the range of percent to percent 
in  we expect our beginning cash balance  cash provided from operations  and available credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our normal operating commitments  to pay dividends and to fund a portion of planned capital expenditures 
we would expect to fund a significant portion of any additional investment in power generating facilities with long term debt 
cash flow activities in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
we funded property and investment additions primarily through a combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow 
cash flows from operations decreased million from the prior year amount  primarily due to the net effect of the las vegas ii power plant sales contract termination and related impairment charge partially offset by a million year over year increase in deferred taxes  a million increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities and a million increase in depreciation and depletion expense 
in  we recognized a substantial increase in our deferred income tax liability due to timing differences associated with mining development and oil exploration costs and accelerated depreciation and other plant related costs 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  primarily for property  plant and equipment additions in the normal course of business 
we had cash outflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to the repayment of million of long term debt  partially offset by a million increase in short term borrowings and the refinancing of million of pollution control revenue bonds 
a detailed description of the significant investing and financing activities follows on january   we prepaid million of the long term debt outstanding on the project level debt at our fountain valley facility 
on may   we repurchased million of our percent senior unsecured notes due on may   we closed on a million day credit facility  which replaced the million facility which was due to expire in august we also amended our million multi year facility that expires in august to conform its compliance calculation to the same calculation as in the new million facility 
we had borrowings of million under these facilities at december  after inclusion of applicable letters of credit  the remaining borrowing capacity under the facilities was million at december  on august   we effected a call on black hills power s million  percent pollution control revenue bonds issued through lawrence county  south dakota 
the bonds had a maturity date of october   we effected a call and refinanced black hills power s million of pollution control revenue bonds

the bonds had a maturity date of in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
we funded property and investment additions primarily through a combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow 
cash flows from operations decreased million over the prior year amount  primarily due to a million decrease in the year over year change in deferred taxes and a million decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by the net effect of the las vegas ii power plant sales contract termination and related impairment charge and a million increase in depreciation and depletion expense 
in  we recognized a substantial increase in our deferred income tax liability due to timing differences associated with accelerated depreciation and expenses related to our large capital investment in power generation assets in and in  the change in our deferred tax liability returned to a more normal level 
during the third quarter of  we received million from allegheny energy supply company  llc for the termination of a fifteen year contract for capacity and energy at our las vegas ii power plant 
we had cash inflows from investing activities of million  which includes approximately million from the sale of seven hydroelectric power plants located in upstate new york  partially offset by million for property  plant and equipment additions and the acquisition of assets 
we had cash outflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to the repayment of million debt  offset by the net proceeds of million from a public offering of million shares of common stock and the sale of million ten year notes 
a detailed description of the significant investing and financing activities follows on april   we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at per share 
net proceeds were approximately million after commissions and expenses 
the proceeds were used to pay off a million credit facility due in may and to repay million under our day revolving credit facility which expired on august  on may   we issued million percent ten year  senior unsecured notes 
net proceeds from the note offering were approximately million after the discount  commissions and expenses 
the proceeds were used to repay our million term loan due september   all of our short term borrowings under our million  day revolving credit facility and all of our outstanding notes payable under our three year revolving credit facility which expires on august  in august  we closed on a million multi year  unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on august  the credit facility replaced the million facility that expired in august and supplements the million facility that expires in august in september  we paid off all of the project level debt and related interest rate swaps totaling million associated with the seven hydroelectric power plants that were sold 
dividends dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in this reflected increases approved by our board of directors from per share in and per share in all dividends were paid out of current earnings 
our three year annualized dividend growth rate was percent 
in january  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend percent to cents per share 
if this dividend is maintained during  it will be equivalent to per share  an annual increase of cents per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under puhca  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
short term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity include our cash on hand  our revolving bank facilities and cash provided by operations 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash unrestricted for operations and million of credit through revolving bank facilities 
approximately million of the cash balance at december  was restricted by subsidiary debt agreements that limit our subsidiaries ability to dividend cash to the parent company 
the bank facilities consist of a million facility due august  and a million facility due may  these bank facilities can be used to fund our working capital needs  for general corporate purposes  and to provide liquidity for a commercial paper program if implemented 
at december   we had million of bank borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
after inclusion of applicable letters of credit  the remaining borrowing capacity under the bank facilities was million at december  the above bank facilities include financial covenants the most restrictive of which are as follows a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and percent of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning april   a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to  and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to if these covenants are violated and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment thereof  the lender would have the right to declare an event of default  terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above covenants 
our liquidity position remained ample in  albeit at lower levels than at the end of the prior year 
our reduction in liquidity is reflected in our lower levels of cash on hand and in the reduced level of capacity on our corporate revolving credit line 
our cash levels at the end of were million lower than at the end of  due to optional reductions of debt and due to purchases of natural gas inventory 
in  we used a portion of our cash to reduce our aggregate short term and long term borrowings by million 
in january  we prepaid million of long term debt at our fountain valley facility  in may  we purchased and retired million of the percent senior unsecured notes due in  in august  we called million of the percent pollution control revenue bonds due in  in october  we called million of the series ab percent first mortgage bonds and also called and refinanced million of percent pollution control revenue bonds and million of percent pollution control revenue bonds 
in  our gas marketing subsidiary increased levels of natural gas inventory in storage through the purchases of gas which were sold for forward delivery in the first and second quarters of at year end  our natural gas inventory was million  compared to million at year end our consolidated net worth was million at december   which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we are required to maintain under the debt covenant described above 
the long term debt component of our capital structure at december  was percent  our total debt leverage ratio was percent and our recourse leverage ratio was approximately percent 
on january   we purchased clf p for approximately million  including the assumption of million of clf p outstanding debt 
we funded the purchase price of this acquisition with existing cash on hand and short term borrowings on bank credit facilities 
in addition  enserco energy  inc  our gas marketing unit  has a million uncommitted  discretionary line of credit to provide credit support for the purchase of natural gas 
as of december   we had a million guarantee to the lender under this facility 
at december   there were outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility of million with no borrowing balances on the facility 
similarly  black hills energy resources  inc bher  our crude oil marketing unit  had a million uncommitted  discretionary credit facility at december  the facility allows bher to elect up to million of available credit via notification to the bank at the beginning of each calendar quarter 
this line of credit provides credit support for the purchases of crude oil by bher 
we provided no guarantee to the lender under this facility 
at december   bher had letters of credit outstanding of million and no borrowing balance outstanding on its overdraft line 
our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results  and capital market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all

these security ratings are subject to revision and or withdrawal at any time by the respective rating organizations 
none of our current credit agreements contain acceleration triggers 
if our issuer credit rating should drop below investment grade  however  pricing under the credit agreements would be affected  increasing interest expense by approximately million pre tax based on december  balances 
in addition  as a result of becoming a registered holding company under puhca  if our credit ratings drop below investment grade  we would be restricted absent prior sec approval in the amounts and types of additional investments which we would be allowed to make

market risk disclosures our activities in the regulated and unregulated energy sector expose us to a number of risks in the normal operations of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing businesses  our natural length in crude oil and natural gas production  and fuel procurement for our gas fired generation assets  and interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
the executive risk committee composed of senior level executives meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
trading activities natural gas marketing we have a natural gas marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing third party natural gas 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial instruments including over the counter swaps and options and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our gas marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the gas marketing commodity risk policies and procedures crpp as approved by the executive risk committee 
as a general policy  we permit only limited market risk positions as clearly defined in these policies and procedures 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor  and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas portfolio 
we measure and monitor the market risk inherent in the natural gas trading portfolio employing value at risk var analysis and scenario analysis 
var is a statistical measure that quantifies the probability and magnitude of potential future losses related to open contract positions 
we use scenario analysis to test the impact of extreme moves in both specific delivery points and overall commodity prices on our portfolio value 
we also monitor and limit our market risk by establishing limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location  and duration 
var is a statistical measure used to quantify the potential loss in fair value of the trading portfolio over a particular time  with a specified likelihood of occurrence  due to adverse market price changes 
we use an external var model from a third party vendor and utilize independent commodity pricing data 
the modeling of var involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
inputs for the var calculation include commodity prices  positions  instrument valuations  and variance covariance matrices 
while we believe that our assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is currently no uniform methodology or best practice for calculating var in the energy sector 
we calculate var on a daily basis to determine the potential three day favorable and unfavorable changes to the market value of our portfolio 
the var is computed utilizing monte carlo simulation based on correlation matrices for price movements over a specified period generally ranging from one to three months to simulate forward price curves in the natural gas markets to estimate the worst case outcomes on the existing portfolio value 
the var computations utilize a percent loss level for a three day holding period with a percent confidence level 
this calculation means that there is a one in one hundred in statistical chance that the portfolio value will fall below the expected maximum potential reduction in portfolio value at least as large as the reported var over a three day period  provided that no mitigation actions are taken during these three days 
at year end  we were completing the implementation of an enhanced trade capture system and due to technical constraints  must estimate our var 
during this system implementation  risk management activities focused upon scrutinizing positions  their changes in daily mark to market and other non statistical risk management techniques 
our estimate of the three day  percent loss level var is approximately million 
actual commodity price volatility can result in portfolio values worse than predicted using the var model 
the var methodology assumes a normal distribution of price changes  thus  if the actual distribution is not normal  the var may understate actual results 
var is used to estimate the risk of the entire gas marketing portfolio 
for locations that have insufficient daily trading activity  var may not accurately estimate risk due to limited price information 
therefore  stress tests are employed  in addition to var  to further measure risk when market price information may prove insufficient 
var is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that past changes in assumed market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
var should be evaluated in light of this and the methodology s other limitations 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the activity in our energy trading portfolio that has been recorded at fair value under a mark to market method of accounting during the year ended december  in thousands total fair value of natural gas marketing marked to market at december   a net cash settled during the year on positions that existed at december  unrealized gain on new positions entered during the year and still existing at december  realized gain on positions that existed at december  and were settled during year unrealized loss on positions that existed at december  and still exist at december  total fair value of natural gas marketing positions marked to market at december  a a the fair value of positions marked to market consists of derivative assets liabilities and natural gas inventory that has been designated as a hedged item and marked to market as part of a fair value hedge  as follows in thousands december  december  net derivative assets liabilities fair value adjustment recorded in material  supplies and fuel on january   the company adopted eitf issue no 
the adoption of eitf resulted in certain energy trading activities no longer being accounted for at fair value  therefore  the above reconciliation does not present a complete picture of our overall portfolio of trading activities and our expected cash flows from those operations 
eitf was superseded by eitf and allowed a broad interpretation of what constituted trading activity and hence what would be marked to market 
eitf took a much narrower view of what trading activity should be marked to market  limiting mark to market treatment primarily to only those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas at our natural gas marketing operations  we often employ strategies that include derivative contracts along with inventory  storage and transportation positions to accomplish the objectives of our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing groups 
except in very limited circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  sfas generally does not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our natural gas marketing positions are economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
at december   we had a mark to fair value unrealized loss of million for our natural gas marketing activities 
of this amount  million was current and million was non current 
the source of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value and thereafter total fair value actively quoted ie  exchange traded prices prices provided by other external sources modeled total the following table presents a reconciliation of our natural gas marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our natural gas forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market 
the approach used in determining the non gaap measure is consistent with our previous accounting methods under eitf fair value of our natural gas marketing positions marked to market in accordance with gaap see footnote a above increase decrease in fair value of inventory  storage and transportation positions that are part of our forward trading book  but that are not marked to market under gaap fair value of all forward positions non gaap activities other than trading crude oil marketing we have a crude oil marketing and transportation services company operating predominately in texas  oklahoma  and louisiana 
we specialize in providing independent producers with marketing and transportation services to market their crude oil production to end use markets 
our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchasing  scheduling services  imbalance management and transportation management 
to provide these services  we execute physical crude oil purchase contracts with producers and resell into various crude oil markets 
through these transactions  we effectively lock in a marketing fee equal to the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  less transportation costs 
the crude oil marketing portfolio is essentially hedged whereby market risk  basis risk and quality differentials are mitigated or eliminated 
we do not speculate with the crude oil marketing portfolio with the intent to generate profits from short term market differences 
any accepted risk will be from small differences in contract terms  index risk  or credit risk 
any risk that we identify will be managed and mitigated within the guidelines stipulated in the bhcrpp 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our crude oil contracts at december  and are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
these natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
any hedging strategies are conducted with an enterprise wide perspective 
as more fully defined in the next section  we have some fuel procurement risk within our gas fired generation business 
therefore  hedging in the oil and gas segment considers any natural hedge offsets in the power generation segment 
in certain cases  we do not hedge forecasted natural gas production when we have offsetting market risk in our fuel requirements in the power generation segment 
in other words  exploration and production s natural length is used to offset generation s short position 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and fair values of our contracts used to hedge portions of our crude oil and natural gas production at december  and are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we use over the counter swaps and options 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place at december  are as follows natural gas location term volume mmbtu day price san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso san juan el paso cig crude oil location term volume barrels month price nymex calendar nymex calendar nymex calendar power generation we have a portfolio of gas fired generation assets located throughout several western states 
the output from most of these generation assets are sold under long term tolling contracts with third parties whereby any commodity price risk is transferred to the third party 
however  we do have some gas fired generation assets under long term contracts and a few merchant plants that do possess market risk for fuel purchases 
it is our policy that fuel risk  to the extent possible  be hedged 
since we are long natural gas in our exploration and production segment  we look at our enterprise wide natural gas market risk when hedging at the subsidiary level 
therefore  we may attempt to hedge only enterprise wide long or short positions 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows in thousands december  notional weighted average fixed interest rate maximum terms in years current assets non current assets current liabilities non current liabilities pre tax accumulated other comprehensive income loss swaps on project financing december  swaps on project financing swaps on corporate debt we anticipate a portion of unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be realized as increased interest expense in based on december  market interest rates  million will be realized as additional interest expense during estimated and realized amounts will likely change during as market interest rates change 
at december   we had million of outstanding  variable rate debt of which million was not offset with interest rate swap transactions that effectively convert the debt to a fixed rate 
a basis point increase in interest rates would cause interest expense to increase million 
the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our short term investments and long term debt obligations  including current maturities in thousands 
thereafter total cash equivalents fixed rate long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate a average interest rate total long term debt average interest rate a approximately percent of the variable rate long term debt has been hedged with interest rate swaps moving the floating rates to fixed rates with an average interest rate of percent 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the black hills corporation credit policy bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee composed of senior executives meets on a regular basis to review the company s credit activities and to monitor compliance with the policies adopted by the company 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we attempt to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at the end of the year  our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utility and communications segment was concentrated with investment grade companies 
approximately percent of our credit exposure was with investment grade companies 
for the percent credit exposure with non investment grade rated counterparties  approximately percent of this exposure was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  parental guarantees and asset liens 
foreign exchange contracts our gas marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell approximately million canadian dollars and at december   had no forward exchange contracts 
at december  and  we also had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million canadian dollars  respectively 
these contracts had a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively  and have been recorded as derivative assets liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  settle by april new accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards adopted in or pending adoption
