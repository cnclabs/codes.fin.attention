item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance operations including net investment income  proceeds from the sale of investments and proceeds from maturing investments 
the company generally experiences positive cash flow resulting from the fact that premiums are collected on insurance policies in advance of the disbursement of funds in payment of claims 
operating costs of the insurance subsidiaries  other than loss and loss expense payments  generally average less than of premiums earned on a consolidated basis and the remaining amount is available for investment for varying periods of time depending on the type of insurance coverage provided 
because losses are often settled in periods different from when they are incurred  at times  operating cash flows may turn negative as loss settlements on claim reserves established in prior years exceed net premium revenue and receipts of investment income 
during  positive cash flow from operations totaled million compared to million in  generally in line with the increase in net premium earned during for several years  the company s investment philosophy has emphasized the purchase of short term bonds with maximum quality and liquidity 
as interest rates have declined and yield curves have not provided a strong incentive to lengthen maturities in recent years  the company has maintained and  during  increased its short term position with respect to the vast majority of its fixed maturity investments in anticipation of rate increases expected to occur in the average life of the company s bond and short term investment portfolio was years and years at december  and  respectively 
the company also remains an active participant in the equity securities market using capital which is not considered necessary to fund current operations 
the long term horizon for the company s equity investments allows it to invest in positions where ultimate value  and not short term market fluctuation  is the primary focus 
investments made by the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners which are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders 
the company s assets at december  included million in short term and cash equivalent investments which are readily convertible to cash without market penalty and an additional million of fixed income investments at par maturing in less than one year 
the company believes that these liquid investments  plus the expected cash flow from current operations  are more than sufficient to provide for projected claim payments and operating cost demands 
in the event competitive conditions produce inadequate premium rates and the company chooses to restrict volume  the liquidity of its investment portfolio would permit it to continue to pay claims as settlements are reached without requiring the disposal of investments at a loss  regardless of interest rates in effect at the time 
in addition  the company s reinsurance program is structured to avoid serious cash drains that might accompany catastrophic losses 
net premiums written by the company s us insurance subsidiaries for equaled approximately of the combined statutory surplus of these subsidiaries 
premium writings of to of surplus are generally considered acceptable by regulatory authorities 
further  the statutory capital of each of the insurance subsidiaries substantially exceeds minimum risk based capital requirements set by the national association of insurance commissioners 
accordingly  the company has the ability to significantly increase its business without seeking additional capital to meet regulatory guidelines 
as more fully discussed in note f to the consolidated financial statements  at december   million  or of shareholders equity  represented net assets of the company s insurance subsidiaries which  at that time  could not be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company because of minimum statutory capital requirements 
however  management believes that these restrictions pose no material liquidity concerns for the company 
the financial strength and stability of the subsidiaries permit ready access by the parent company to short term and long term sources of credit 
the company has no long term debt outstanding at december  short term borrowing totaled million at december  results of operations compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet trucking liability premiums of million from levels 
direct premium writings from the company s independent contractor program also increased by million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the company s private passenger automobile  small business workers compensation and small fleet trucking programs of million  
million and 
million  respectively 
large trucking fleet volume increased primarily from the addition of new accounts during  increased revenues from renewal accounts and  to a lesser degree  premium rate increases 
the higher premium volume from the independent contractor program resulted from the addition of contractors by existing accounts 
increased competitive pressures are responsible for the decline in premium volume from the sagamore personal automobile and small fleet trucking programs 
the decline in small business workers compensation premium resulted from management s decision to discontinue marketing this business during the fourth quarter of premiums assumed from other insurers and reinsurers totaled million during  a decrease of million from reflecting the discontinuance of a single large program for which renewal pricing was not considered to be favorable 
premium volume from reinsurance assumed will fluctuate depending on the favorability of pricing for the coverages provided 
further  premium volume for this segment is limited by the company s self imposed limitation to loss from a single catastrophic event 
premiums ceded to reinsurers increased million during to million 
however  the consolidated percentage of premiums ceded to direct premiums written decreased to for from for this decrease is reflective of the company s increased exposure under reinsurance treaties effective in and covering large fleet trucking risks 
the company s maximum retained loss under these treaties has increased over the last two years and  as a result  a lower percentage of the direct premiums are ceded to reinsurers 
there were no other significant changes to reinsurance treaties during after giving effect to changes in unearned premiums  net premiums earned increased to million for from million for excluding inter company reinsurance arrangements  net premiums earned from all trucking related insurance products increased by million 
net premiums earned from the company s private passenger automobile and small workers compensation programs also increased million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net premium earned from non affiliated reinsurance assumed of million from net investment income decreased 
million during reflecting lower overall pre tax yields while average invested assets increased 
the average pre tax yield on invested assets dropped to this year from during 
the decline in yields occurred entirely within the bond portfolio which averaged during compared to last year 
a portion of this decline in pre tax yield is attributable to the increased use of tax exempt bonds during yields on equity securities and short term investments increased to and  respectively  from and  respectively  during  partially offsetting the decline in bond yields 
after tax yields were and for and  respectively 
as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section  the company has maintained its bond portfolio at an increasingly short term level during the past several years as long term interest rates were not considered to be sufficient to commit funds for extended periods 
increases in short term rates during did not have a dramatic impact on longer term rates  providing no incentive to lengthen maturities 
consequently  the average yield on maturing bonds exceeded the reinvestment rate during as shorter term instruments were utilized in anticipation of more dramatic increases in long term rates in and beyond 
realized net capital gains were million in compared to gains of million for the current year s net gain consisted of gains on equity securities of million  gains on fixed maturities of million  and losses on other investments of 
million 
capital gains for the current year include a net gain of million attributable to the process of accounting for other than temporary impairment in the investment portfolio 
the net gain includes million representing subsequent appreciation on previously written down securities disposed of during offset by additional write downs during the year 
see the investment valuation section under the caption critical accounting policies and note b to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to the other than temporary impairment adjustment process 
losses and loss expenses incurred during increased million to million 
the increase in losses incurred is reflective of the increase in net premiums earned  and primarily the increase in premiums from trucking related products  as previously discussed  and from million of losses attributable to the florida hurricanes during september  the consolidated loss and loss expense ratio was compared to for the company s loss and loss expense ratios for individual product lines are summarized in the following table 
loss and loss expense ratios fleet trucking private passenger automobile small fleet trucking reinsurance assumed small business workers compensation all lines the loss and loss expense ratio for fleet trucking products for reflects an increase in severity of accidents  particularly in the large fleet excess product 
while overall frequency in the trucking lines has not increased significantly  the frequency of severe losses was higher in part of the increase in severity is attributable to social inflation factors which result in higher jury awards and settlements on serious accidents 
the company s higher retention under recent reinsurance treaty renewals also allows for more net volatility in this line of business 
the loss and loss expense ratio for reinsurance assumed increased by percentage points  and relates primarily to hurricane losses in the small business workers compensation program continued to perform poorly 
this continued unsatisfactory performance prompted management to discontinue this product in the current year fourth quarter 
the company produced an overall savings on the handling of prior year claims during of million 
this net savings is included in the computation of loss ratios shown in the table insert 
because of the high limits provided by the company to its large trucking fleet insureds  the length of time required to settle larger  more complex claims and the volatility of the trucking liability insurance business  the company believes it is important to have a high degree of conservatism in its reserving process 
as claims are settled in years subsequent to their occurrence  the company s claim handling process has  historically  tended to produce savings from the reserves provided 
the company believes that favorable loss developments are attributable to the company s long standing policy of reserving for losses realistically and a willingness to settle claims based upon a seasoned evaluation of its exposures 
changes in both gross premium volumes and the company s reinsurance structure for its large trucking fleets can have a significant impact on future loss developments and  as a result  loss and loss expense ratios and prior year reserve development may not be consistent year to year 
other operating expenses for  before credits for allowances from reinsurers  increased 
million to million 
gross expenses increased at a lower rate than the increase in premium volume because much of the company s expense structure is fixed and does not vary directly with volume 
in general  only commissions to independent agents  premium taxes and other acquisition costs vary directly with premium volume 
direct commission expense increased 
million due to growth in business produced by outside agents 
resulting primarily from the increase in premium earned  taxes other than federal income and salary related taxes increased 
million from most other expense categories were level or down from the prior year as the investment in automation during the past several years has allowed for the handling of higher premium volume without the addition of employees 
reinsurance ceded credits were 
million higher in  in line with higher reinsurance ceded premiums 
while the dollars of reinsurance ceded credits were higher this year  the ratio of reinsurance ceded credits to gross acquisition costs declined because protective is retaining a greater percentage of the gross premium for its own account under recent reinsurance treaties 
substantially all fleet trucking business is produced by direct sales efforts of baldwin lyons  inc employees and  accordingly  this business does not incur commission expense on a consolidated basis 
instead  the expenses of the agency operations  including salaries and bonuses of salesmen  travel expenses  etc 
are included in operating expenses 
in general  commissions paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company exceed related acquisition costs incurred in the production of fleet trucking business 
the ratio of net operating expenses of the insurance subsidiaries to net premiums earned was during compared to for including the agency operations  and after elimination of inter company commissions  the ratio of other operating expenses to operating revenue defined as total revenue less realized gains on investments was for compared with for  and reflects the fixed nature of certain of the company s expenses  as discussed above 
the effective federal tax rate for consolidated operations for was 
this rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of tax exempt investment income 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  net income for was million compared to million for diluted earnings per share decreased to in from in earnings per share from operations  before realized gains or losses on investments  was in compared to in compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily attributable to increases in fleet trucking liability and private passenger automobile programs of million and million  respectively  from levels 
direct premium writings from the company s small trucking fleet  independent contractor and small business workers compensation programs also increased by million  million and million  respectively 
large trucking fleet volume increased primarily from the addition of new accounts during and the fact that a full year of premiums was recorded for the new accounts added in increased revenues from renewal accounts and  to a lesser degree  premium rate increases also contributed to the increase in large fleet trucking liability premiums during the higher premium volume from the independent contractor program resulted from the addition of contractors by existing accounts 
increased premium volume from the sagamore personal automobile and commercial divisions came largely from existing market areas resulting from improving market conditions and  to a lesser extent  from geographic expansion 
premiums assumed from other insurers and reinsurers totaled million during  an increase of million from improved pricing in this market allowed the company to increase its participation in existing treaties and  to a lesser extent  add new treaties during premium volume for this division is limited by the company s self imposed limitation to loss from a single catastrophic event 
further  the company s participation in reinsurance assumed in the future will be restricted should pricing become less favorable 
premiums ceded to reinsurers increased million during to million 
the consolidated percentage of premiums ceded to direct premiums written decreased to for from for this decrease is reflective of the company s increased exposure under reinsurance treaties effective in and covering large fleet trucking risks 
the company s maximum retained loss under these treaties has increased over the last two years and  as a result  a lower percentage of the direct premiums are ceded to reinsurers 
after giving effect to changes in unearned premiums  net premiums earned increased to million for from million for excluding inter company reinsurance arrangements  net premiums earned from all trucking related insurance products increased by million 
net premiums earned from the company s private passenger automobile  non affiliated reinsurance assumed and small business workers compensation programs also increased million  million and million  respectively 
net investment income decreased million during reflecting lower overall pre tax yields while average invested assets increased 
the average pre tax yield on invested assets dropped to in from during 
the largest decline in yields occurred in the bond portfolio which averaged during compared to in yields on short term investments also declined from in to 
in after tax yields declined less than pre tax because of a reallocation of the investment portfolio whereby corporate fully taxable bonds were replaced with municipal largely tax exempt bonds 
after tax yields were and for and  respectively 
realized net capital gains were million in compared to losses of million for the current year s net gain consisted of gains on equity securities of million  gains on fixed maturities of 
million  and gains on other investments of 
million 
the gains on equity securities include approximately million of gains realized by disposal of securities whose recorded value had previously been written down due to other than temporary impairment concerns 
partially offsetting the effect of other than temporary impairment adjustments on securities sold was million in unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities still owned which experienced a decline in market value of more than for more than six months and  accordingly  were reclassified as realized losses during the gains realized during reflect the improvement in the equity markets  in general  particularly in the last quarter 
losses and loss expenses incurred during increased million to million 
the increase in losses incurred is reflective of the increase in net premiums earned  as previously discussed 
the consolidated loss and loss expense ratio was compared to for the loss and loss expense ratios for the company s fleet trucking and private passenger automobile programs were fairly consistent with that experienced in small fleet trucking experienced a percentage point increase in its loss and loss expense ratio due to the increased frequency and severity of reported claims while the loss and loss expense ratio for reinsurance assumed dropped by percentage points  reflecting the lack of major catastrophe activity affecting treaties in which the company participates 
the loss and loss expense ratio for the small business workers compensation program increased to in from in this significant increase is due to approximately 
million in adjustments to prior year losses resulting from internal management review of the reserving methodologies for this product as well as increased frequency and severity of losses 
including the deficiency noted above for the small business workers compensation product  the company produced an overall savings on the handling of prior year claims during of million 
see comments regarding prior year reserve savings in the comparison of to other operating expenses for  before credits for allowances from reinsurers  increased million to million 
gross expenses increased at a lower rate than the increase in premium volume because much of the company s expense structure is fixed and does not vary directly with volume 
personnel related expenses  including amounts allocated to loss expenses and investment income  increased due mainly to employee incentives based upon company performance in addition to a increase in the number of employees during direct commission expense increased million due to growth in all of the company s business produced by outside agents and as the result of increased participation in voluntary reinsurance assumed treaties 
ceding commission allowances from reinsurers increased million  resulting from increased premium volume ceded under reinsurance agreements covering protective s fleet trucking business 
the ratio of net operating expenses of the insurance subsidiaries to net premiums earned was during compared to for including the agency operations  and after elimination of inter company commissions  the ratio of other operating expenses to operating revenue was for compared with for  with the increase primarily attributable to the lower ratio of ceding commission income to gross acquisition costs  as less of the gross premium is ceded to reinsurers 
the effective federal tax rate for consolidated operations for was 
this rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of tax exempt investment income 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  net income for was million compared to million for diluted earnings per share increased to in from 
in earnings per share from operations before realized gains or losses on investments was in compared to in critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is provided to highlight areas of the company s accounting policies which are both material and subject to significant degrees of estimation 
investment valuation all marketable securities are included in the company s balance sheet at current fair market value 
approximately of the company s assets are composed of investments at december  approximately of these investments  consisting of limited partnership investments in equity trading and hedge funds  real estate development ventures and venture capital funds  do not have readily determinable market values 
for these investments  we estimate fair value by reference to the underlying assets of the limited partnerships 
in addition  approximately million of fixed maturity investments of total invested assets consists of bonds rated as less than investment grade at year end 
the majority of this total is composed of shares in a widely diversified high yield municipal bond fund where exposure to default by any single issuer is extremely limited 
further  the average bond quality of assets held in this fund at year end was bbb  which would be considered investment grade 
we have included the investment in this fund in the total of non investment grade bonds since  under the terms of the fund  the average bond quality could fall below bbb 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below cost is other than temporary  we first make an objective analysis of each individual security where current market value is less than cost 
for any security where the unrealized loss exceeds of original or adjusted cost  and where that decline has existed for a period of at least six months  the decline is treated as an other than temporary impairment  without any subjective evaluation as to possible future recovery 
the only exception exists where substantial recovery to cost has actually occurred prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
for individual issues where the decline in value is less than but the amount of the decline is considered significant  a similar objective evaluation is conducted but  in these cases  we will also evaluate the market conditions  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures for the securities to determine if it appears that the decline is other than temporary 
for any decline which is considered to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results as an addition to realized capital losses 
declines which are considered to be temporary are recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity  net of related federal income tax credits 
it is important to note that all investments included in the company s financial statements are valued at current fair market values 
the evaluation process for determination of other than temporary decline in value of investments does not change these valuations but  rather  determines when the decline in value will be recognized in the income statement other than temporary decline as opposed to a charge to shareholders equity temporary decline 
subsequent recoveries in value of investments which have incurred an other than temporary impairment adjustment are accounted for as unrealized gains until the security is actually disposed of or sold 
at december   unrealized gains include million of appreciation on investments previously adjusted for other than temporary impairment  compared to a million impairment allowance at that date 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail with respect to this process 
this evaluation process is subject to risks and uncertainties since it is not always clear what has caused a decline in value of an individual security or since some declines may be associated with general market conditions or economic factors which relate to an industry  in general  but not necessarily to an individual issue 
the company has attempted to minimize many of these uncertainties by adopting a largely objective evaluation process which results in automatic income statement recognition of any investment which  over a six month period  is unable to recover from a decline in value from our cost basis 
however  to the extent that certain declines in value are reported as unrealized at december   it is possible that future earnings charges will result should the declines in value increase or persist or should the security actually be disposed of while market values are less than cost 
at december   the total gross unrealized loss included in the company s investment portfolio was less than million 
no individual issue constituted a material amount of this total 
had this entire amount been considered other than temporary at december   realized capital gains would have decreased by 
per share for the year 
there would  however  have been no impact on total shareholders equity or book value per share since the decline in value of these securities was already recognized as a reduction to shareholders equity at december  reinsurance recoverable amounts recoverable under the terms of reinsurance contracts comprise approximately of total company assets as of december  in order to be able to provide the high limits required by the company s trucking company insureds  we share a significant amount of the insurance risk of the underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
some reinsurance contracts provide that a loss be shared among the company and its reinsurers on a predetermined pro rata basis quota share while other contracts provide that the company keep a fixed amount of the loss  similar to a deductible  with reinsurers taking all losses above this fixed amount excess of loss 
some risks are covered by a combination of quota share and excess of loss contracts 
the computation of amounts due from reinsurers is based upon the terms of the various contracts and follows the underlying estimation process for loss and loss expense reserves  as described below 
accordingly  the uncertainties inherent in the loss and loss expense reserving process also affect the amounts recorded as recoverable from reinsurers 
estimation uncertainties are greatest for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to the company 
further  the high limits provided by the company s insurance policies for trucking liability and workers compensation  provide more variability in the estimation process than lines of business with lower coverage limits 
it should be noted  however  that a change in the estimate of amounts due from reinsurers on unpaid claims will not  in itself  result in charges or credits to losses incurred 
this is because any change in estimated recovery follows the estimate of the underlying loss 
thus  it is the computation of the underlying loss that is critical 
as with any receivable  credit risk exists in the recoverability of reinsurance 
this is even more pronounced than in normal receivable situations since recoverable amounts are not generally due until the loss is settled which  in some cases  may be many years after the contract was written 
if a reinsurer is unable  in the future  to meet its financial commitments under the terms of the contracts  the company would be responsible for the reinsurer s portion of the loss 
the financial condition of each of the company s reinsurers is initially determined upon the execution of a given treaty and only reinsurers with the highest credit ratings available are utilized 
however  as noted above  reinsurers are often not called upon to satisfy their obligations for several years and changes in credit worthiness can occur in the interim period 
reviews of the current financial strength of each reinsurer are made continually and  should impairment in the ability of a reinsurer be determined to exist  current year operations would be charged in amounts sufficient to provide for the company s additional liability 
such charges are included in other operating expenses  rather than losses and loss expenses incurred  since the inability of the company to collect from reinsurers is a credit risk rather than a deficiency associated with the loss reserving process 
loss and loss expense reserves the company s reserves for losses and loss expenses reserves are determined based on complex estimation processes using historical experience  current economic information and  when necessary  available industry statistics 
reserves are evaluated in three basic categories case basis  incurred but not reported and loss adjustment expense reserves 
case basis reserves are established for specific known loss occurrences at amounts dependent upon various criteria such as type of coverage  severity and the underlying policy limits  as examples 
case basis reserves are generally estimated by experienced claims adjusters using established company guidelines and are subject to review by claims management 
incurred but not reported reserves  which are established for those losses which have occurred  but have not yet been reported to the company  are not linked to specific claims but are computed on a bulk basis 
common actuarial methods are used in the establishment of incurred but not reported loss reserves using company historical loss data  consideration of changes in the company s business and study of current economic trends affecting ultimate claims costs 
loss adjustment expense reserves  or reserves for the costs associated with the investigation and settlement of a claim  are also bulk reserves representing the company s estimate of the costs associated with the claims handling process 
loss adjustment expense reserves include amounts ultimately allocable to individual claims as well as amounts required for the general overhead of the claims handling operation that are not specifically allocable to individual claims 
historical analyses of the ratio of loss adjusting expenses to losses paid on prior closed claims and study of current economic trends affecting loss settlement costs are used to estimate the loss adjustment reserve needs related to the established loss reserves 
each of these reserve categories contain elements of uncertainty which assure variability when compared to the ultimate costs to settle the underlying claims for which the reserves are established 
the reserving process requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims based on the class of business and the nature of claims 
our claims range from the very routine private passenger automobile fender bender to the highly complex and costly third party bodily injury claim involving large tractor trailer rigs 
reserving for each class of claims requires a set of assumptions based upon historical experience  knowledge of current industry trends and seasoned judgment 
the high limits provided in the company s trucking liability policies provide for greater variation in the reserving process for more serious claims 
court rulings  tort reform or lack thereof and trends in jury awards also play a significant role in the estimation process of larger claims 
the company continuously reviews and evaluates loss developments subsequent to each measurement date and adjusts its reserve estimation assumptions  as necessary  in an effort to achieve the best possible estimate of the ultimate remaining loss costs at any point in time 
changes to previously established reserve amounts are charged or credited to losses and loss expenses incurred in the accounting periods in which they are determined 
note c to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information relating to loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development 
forward looking information any forward looking statements in this report including  without limitation  statements relating to the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and adequacy of resources  are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following i the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations and intentions are subject to change at any time at the discretion of the company  ii the company s business is highly competitive and the entrance of new competitors into or the expansion of the operations by existing competitors in the company s markets and other changes in the market for insurance products could adversely affect the company s plans and results of operations  and iii other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
federal income tax considerations the liability method is used in accounting for federal income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for deferred federal income tax was based on items of income and expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference originated 
net deferred tax liabilities reported at december  and consisted of total deferred tax liabilities   total deferred tax assets   net deferred tax liabilities   the total deferred tax assets at december  included  in special tax deposits covered under section of the internal revenue code  as explained in the following paragraph  which compares to  in special tax deposits at december  adjusted for the special deposits  net deferred tax assets at december  were  compared with  million at december  section of the internal revenue code created a mechanism which assures recoverability for the deferred tax asset arising from the discounting of property and casualty loss reserves for tax purposes 
this provision allows an insurer to take a special tax deduction equal to the discount on post accident year loss and loss expense reserves while making special estimated tax payments equal to the amount of the tax benefit derived from the special deduction 
the special estimated tax payments can be carried forward for fifteen years to offset taxes arising from decreases in the special deduction and can be treated as regular estimated payments or refunded at the end of the carryforward period 
because the recovery of this deferred tax asset is guaranteed  it need not be considered when determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
of the remaining deferred tax assets at december   approximately  relate to other policy liability discounts required by the internal revenue code which are perpetual in nature and  in the absence of the termination of business  will not reverse to a material degree in the foreseeable future 
an additional  relates to impairment adjustments made to investments  as required by accounting regulations 
the sizable unrealized gains in the company s investment portfolios would allow for the recovery of this deferred tax at any time 
the balance of deferred tax assets  approximately  consists of various normal operating expense accruals and is not considered to be material 
as a result of its analysis  management does not believe that any of these assets are impaired at december  impact of inflation to the extent possible  the company attempts to recover the costs of inflation by increasing the premiums it charges 
within the fleet trucking business  a majority of the company s premiums are charged as a percentage of an insured s gross revenue or payroll 
as these charging bases increase with inflation  premium revenues are immediately increased 
the remaining premium rates charged are adjustable only at periodic intervals and often require state regulatory approval 
such periodic increases in premium rates may lag far behind cost increases 
to the extent inflation influences yields on investments  the company is also affected 
the company s short term and fixed investment portfolios are structured in direct response to available interest rates over the yield curve 
as available market interest rates fluctuate in response to the presence or absence of inflation  the yields on the company s investments are impacted 
further  as inflation affects current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
see comments under market risk  following 
inflation must also be considered by the company in the creation and review of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
market risk the company operates solely within the property and casualty insurance industry and  accordingly  has significant invested assets which are exposed to various market risks 
these market risks relate to interest rate fluctuations  equities market prices and  to a far lesser extent  foreign currency rate fluctuations 
all of the company s invested assets are classified as available for sale and are listed as such in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of the three identified market risks relates to prices in the equities market 
though not the largest category of the company s invested assets  equity securities have the greatest potential for short term price fluctuation 
the market value of the company s equity positions at december  was million or approximately of invested assets 
this market valuation includes million of appreciation over the cost basis of the equity security investments 
funds invested in the equities market are not considered to be assets necessary for the company to conduct its daily operations and  therefore  can be committed for extended periods of time 
the long term nature of the company s equity investments allows it to invest in positions where ultimate value  and not short term market fluctuations  is the primary focus 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio totaled million at december  over of this portfolio is made up of u 
s 
government and government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities  of the portfolio matures within years  and the average life of the company s fixed maturity investments is approximately years 
although the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its fixed maturity investments  given the anticipated duration of the company s liabilities principally insurance loss and loss expense reserves relative to investment maturities  even a to basis point increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct daily operations or to meet its obligations 
there is an inverse relationship between interest rate fluctuations and the fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments 
additionally  the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the financial strength of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the investment and other general market conditions 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by measuring the change in fair value of its fixed maturity investments relative to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
as previously indicated  several other factors can impact the fair values of fixed maturity investments and  therefore  significant variations in market interest rates could produce quite different results from the hypothetical estimates presented in the next paragraph 
we estimate that a basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a pre tax loss in the fair value of fixed maturity investments of approximately million at december  similarly  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated pre tax gain in the fair value of these instruments of approximately million at december  note  however  that the hypothetical loss mentioned above would only be realized if the company was obligated to sell bonds prior to maturity  which is extremely unlikely 
the aggregate value of money market and short term investments  bonds maturing within twelve months and expected positive cash flow from operations for is equal to more than of net loss and loss expense reserves at december  the company s exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth the amounts of the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than more than year years years years dollars in millions loss and loss expense reserves investment commitments operating leases total the company s loss and loss expense reserves do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of the payment of claims cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of when we might expect our direct loss and loss expense reserves without the benefit of reinsurance recoveries to be paid in the preceding table 
timing of the collection of the related reinsurance recoverable  estimated to be million at december   would approximate that of the above projected direct reserve payout 
the investment commitments in the above table relate to unfunded capital obligations for limited partnership investments the company owned at december annual report on form k
