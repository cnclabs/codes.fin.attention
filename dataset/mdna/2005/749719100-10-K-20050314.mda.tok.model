we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements in this report because these statements speak only as of the date when made 
any prospective percentages do not include the impact of the revision to sfas  furthermore  we are not obligated to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including without limitation the factors described below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
overview rsa security inc and its consolidated subsidiaries are focused on helping customers confidently protect and manage identities and information access 
with approximately  customers worldwide  rsa security has a year track record of award winning solutions 
built to work seamlessly in heterogeneous environments  our portfolio of identity access and management solutions is designed to inspire customers to confidently exploit the full power of the internet as well as secure access to valuable information assets in their enterprise networks 
we derive our operating revenue primarily from two distinct product groups enterprise solutions  which includes rsa securid authentication credentials  rsa authentication manager formerly known as rsa ace server software  rsa cleartrust software  rsa certificate manager formerly known as rsa keon software  and maintenance and professional services associated with those products  and developer solutions  which includes rsa bsafe encryption software and protocol products  rsa certificate manager components  and maintenance and professional services associated with those products 
we believe sales of our products are and will be driven by two major trends enterprises web enabling their existing applications and enterprises permitting secure and efficient access to internal resources whether remotely or within the enterprise 
sales of our rsa securid authentication credentials continue to generate substantial revenue for us  while our less mature enterprise software products are building revenue 
we believe the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line continues to put pressure on our developer solutions revenue 
we believe our product line synergies and the strength of our customer base create opportunities to sell additional products to existing customers 
however  we have observed that information technology budgets remain constrained  which has had and could continue to have a direct effect on the sale of our products 
we continue to explore opportunities to sell our products into new markets  and we are currently focusing on two new market opportunities 
first  although most of our customers continue to use our products to authenticate users accessing electronic resources remotely  from outside the enterprise  with the launch of our rsa securid for microsoft windows solution  some of our customers are using our products to authenticate users within the enterprise 
second  although the majority of our customers utilize our products to secure and to manage network and application access for their employees and partners  we have recently increased sales to customers  including internet service providers and financial institutions  who are also using our products to secure and manage access for their customers  including consumer customers 
today we see interest in consumer authentication broadening to many more types of consumer facing applications  which we believe is driven by concerns about identity theft and privacy  and the desire to comply with information protection regulations 
while still early  we believe that these expanded markets have the potential to generate incremental demand for our products 
our enterprise solutions customers typically place an initial order for a limited number of users  for either our rsa securid authenticators or any of our software products  and deploy additional authenticators or software licenses as their need for our products within their enterprise increases 
authenticators have a 
table of contents programmed life of two to five years  and as they expire  our customers typically place additional orders for replacement authenticators 
we typically base our rsa authentication manager  rsa certificate manager and rsa cleartrust software license fees on the number of users authorized under each customer s license 
in most cases  customers also enter into an annual customer support agreement for their software license at the time of initial purchase and renew this support agreement annually 
our support agreement entitles our customers to license software upgrades and telephone support 
our developer solutions software licensing terms vary by product and customer 
typical licensing terms may include an initial prepaid license fee and ongoing royalties paid as a percentage of the developer s product or service revenue  or payment of annual license fees  or a single fully paid up license fee 
often  our existing developer customers go on to license new software or technology from us or wish to increase the field of use rights for the technology they have already licensed 
in such a case  we amend our license agreement with the customer and charge additional licensing fees  thus deriving additional revenue 
our professional services group provides customers with project management  architecture and design  physical deployment  custom development  education and practitioner certification services 
customers typically pay for professional services either at a fixed price or at hourly or daily rates for the time it takes us to complete the project 
we have contracted with outside manufacturing organizations to produce our rsa securid hardware authenticators  and many of our products contain technology that is licensed from third parties 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture and delivery of rsa securid authenticators and royalty fees that we pay for the licensed technology 
cost of revenue also includes warranty obligation expense and labor and overhead costs associated with professional services  customer support  and production activities 
production costs include the programming labor  shipping  inspection and quality control functions associated with the rsa securid authenticators 
we continue to work to establish new supplier relationships in order to increase the number of vendors from which we buy our authenticators and authenticator components  in order to reduce our vulnerability to potential supply problems 
we distribute our products through direct sales to end user customers  and through indirect sales  including i sales to resellers and distributors that we ship directly to the end user customer and ii sales to distributors for stocking purposes 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was from sales to distributors shipped directly to the end user and resellers  approximately of our revenue was from direct sales to end user customers  and approximately of our revenue was from sales to stocking distributors 
our stocking distributors provide us with inventory level and point of sale reports on a monthly basis 
based upon these reports  we estimate that our stocking distributors typically hold approximately four weeks of inventory on hand in the distribution channel 
generally our arrangements with our distributors and resellers are non exclusive 
we currently have arrangements with more than  distributors and resellers and are constantly seeking to expand the number of quality participants and volume of sales in our distributor and reseller program 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in either us dollars or local currency  with the majority of our sales denominated in us dollars 
where we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoicing until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  
table of contents we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  doubtful accounts  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructurings  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources i sales of products  including hardware and software licenses  and ii services  including maintenance  support and professional services 
our management must make and use judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we reduce revenue by provisions for estimated sales returns 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may materially differ if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates in establishing our allowance for sales returns 
an increase in our allowance for sales returns would reduce our revenue in the period for which the increase is recorded 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the documented agreement 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the fee is fixed 
we assess if collection is probable based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we do not record revenue until such time as collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we do not generally include acceptance provisions in arrangements with customers  however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of product to stocking distributors who have only limited return rights  and record a sales return reserve to provide for estimated product returns 
we estimate product returns from distributors based upon historical experience 
when arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
we base our determination of vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements in multi element arrangements on either the price we charge when the same element is sold separately or the price established by the members of our management  who have the relevant authority to set prices  for an element not yet sold separately 
for arrangements containing multiple elements where vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements until vsoe of fair value exists or all elements have been delivered 
some of our arrangements contain bundled products which include a term software license  an rsa securid authenticator and support for the term of the license 
as these arrangements contain multiple elements where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we record these arrangements as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the license agreement 
we defer maintenance service revenue  whether sold separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement  and recognize it ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally twelve months 

table of contents we recognize revenue allocated to professional service elements as the services are performed 
when the customization is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the software license and professional services revenue are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which requires revenue to be recognized as a percentage of the project completed 
we recognize revenue and gross profit using labor hours as an input measure of progress to completion on these arrangements 
allowance for sales returns we record allowances for estimated sales returns and allowances on products and maintenance and professional service related revenue in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  current economic trends  product line and customer industry data and other known factors 
our historical experience with sales returns varies by product line depending on the customer  industry and market 
we must make judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the allowances for estimated sales returns in any reporting period 
the amount and timing of our revenue and our cash flows for any reporting period may materially differ if actual sales returns and allowances differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  regional factors and other known factors when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon our analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we record recoveries of accounts previously written off as uncollectible as increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for warranty obligations our standard practice is to provide a warranty on all rsa securid hardware authenticators for the customer selected programmed life of the authenticator generally two to five years and to replace any defective authenticators other than authenticators damaged by a user s abuse or alteration free of charge 
we sell our other products to customers with a warranty for product defects for a specified period  generally ninety days 
we provide reserves for warranty obligations based on historical failure and defective return rates  and include these costs as a component of product cost of revenue 
we reevaluate the estimate of warranty and defective return obligations  including the assumptions about estimated failure and return rates  each quarter 
during and  our analysis of historical failure and defective return rates indicated that certain authenticators produced between and were subject to higher defect and failure rates than we had previously experienced 
accordingly  we recorded provisions for warranty obligations of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we will continue to monitor warranty claims and reevaluate our estimate of warranty and defective return obligations in future periods  which may result in our recording additional warranty expense 
actual warranty returns could differ from the allowance for warranty obligations recorded 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we perform an annual assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all of the available evidence  both positive and negative 
we assessed the realization of our deferred tax assets at the end of and concluded that due to historical and forecasted tax losses  which are primarily attributable to tax deductions for employee stock options and to restructuring costs accrued in prior years  we could not meet the more likely than not standard required by generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance in of  against our deferred tax assets  primarily various net operating loss and r d tax credit carryforwards 
approximately  of the valuation allowances are allocable to 
table of contents continuing operations and impacted our effective tax rate for the year 
the remaining  of valuation allowances reflect the impact of employee stock options and are allocable directly to shareholders equity 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets 
we base the valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
a change in our estimate of income by jurisdiction could cause a change in our annual effective tax rate 
we are required to reserve for certain loss contingencies relating to  among other things  income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
as a result we are  from time to time  subjected to various us  international and state tax audits 
accordingly  we reserve for potential tax liabilities due in these various jurisdictions 
we review these tax reserves annually 
in connection with our review of the tax reserves for  we determined that the amount of reserves required for tax exposures was less than the amount recorded in the financial statements 
as a result  we reduced the tax reserves by  in valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and earnings and other factors used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
we generally determine fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we perform an annual test for impairment of our goodwill as of november of each year and  if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount  will perform an interim impairment test 
we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of november   by comparing the carrying amount of the enterprise to the estimated fair value of the enterprise 
estimated fair value of the enterprise was determined based upon the market multiple valuation method  which requires that we utilize estimates of future cash flows  revenue and earnings 
as of november   the fair value of the enterprise was greater than the carrying amount of the enterprise 
therefore  our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of november  did not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill  which accounted for approximately of our total assets 
any goodwill impairment test could result in a decrease to the carrying value of goodwill and could have a material effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position 
restructurings during and  we initiated consolidation of certain operations in order to enhance operational efficiency and reduce expenses  and recorded significant restructuring charges in connection with these actions 
restructuring charges totaled million in and million in these restructuring charges and our continued analysis of our facilities require us to make estimates based upon real estate market conditions  rental rates  future corporate requirements  general economic conditions and future estimated cash flows 
included in the restructuring charges recorded in are facility exit costs of million  which represents estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to lease payments due through under certain exited facilities lease agreements  impaired leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  and other associated facilities expenses 
we base estimates related to anticipated sublease market rates for excess facilities on assumptions regarding the time period required to locate and contract with suitable subtenants and base these assumptions on market trend information analysis 

table of contents we continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
as a result of these ongoing assessments  during we recorded a charge of million related to revised estimates of facility exit costs 
we revised this estimate of facility exit costs based upon the terms of finalized subleases and associated costs obtained during the second quarter of we also reduced our restructuring reserve by million at december  when we determined our remaining severance and operating costs were lower than originally estimated 
during we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
these revisions resulted in no net change to our restructuring liability at december  we revised estimates included in facility exit charges based upon the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to lower than anticipated operating costs and other direct costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to revisions in anticipated headcount growth 
these revised estimates of excess facility costs resulted in a net increase to facility exit costs of million at december  in addition  we reduced our severance restructuring reserve by million at december  when we determined our remaining severance and other outplacement costs were lower than originally estimated 
we also reduced our restructuring reserve of costs associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets by million at december  when we determined we had no legal and consulting costs remaining in connection with this transaction 
we will continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
if the assumptions for the estimates used in our restructuring reserve change due to changes in the real estate and sublease markets  or due to the terms of sublease agreements that we have obtained  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these facilities could vary by material amounts  and could cause us to record additional or revise previously recorded restructuring charges in future reporting periods which could have a material effect on our results of operations and consolidated position 
future accounting pronouncements on december   fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation titled share based payment 
this revision requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
the revision will be effective for public companies for fiscal periods beginning after june  the standard offers alternative methods of adopting the final rule 
we have not yet determined which alternative method we will use and the impact on the financial statements

our identity and access management solutions promote our product synergies and enable us to generate additional revenue by selling additional products to existing customers 
an increasing number of small and mid size businesses are adopting our authentication products 
some of our existing larger customers have expanded their deployments of our products 
our sales to the financial services and technology vertical markets have continued to provide increased revenue for us 

table of contents we believe that our future total revenue will be influenced by several major factors as new  lower cost remote access technologies become available and as employment rates increase  we believe that we will benefit with increased total product revenue 
we believe that governmental regulations regarding access and distribution of private information will drive demand for our products 
we believe that as the united states government proceeds with its agenda of increasing awareness and funding of cyber security issues and focusing on homeland security  we may benefit with increased revenue 
however  information technology budgets continue to be constrained  and the continued uncertainty in the economy and global affairs may affect revenue generated from the sales of our products in future quarters

we believe our rsa securid authentication products generate and will continue to generate substantial revenue for us 
we believe the increase in our web access management revenue is due in part to an increase in the number of companies allowing access of their information and applications by internal and external users 
we believe that our web access management revenue will continue to grow due to introductions of new enhancements to our products  including the rsa federal identity manager  strong technology and strategic partnerships 
in addition  we have dedicated a portion of our sales force to focus on selling our emerging products 
the increase in developer solutions and encryption revenue during the year ended as compared to the year ended was primarily due to an increase in sales in the technology vertical market 
we believe that developer solutions revenue may benefit from companies needs to secure their transactions due to various regulatory requirements 
the increase in service revenue for as compared to can primarily be attributed to purchases by new customers coupled with high renewals of annual maintenance contracts from sales of products in prior periods 
we believe the government sector of our business may increase in the future as government agencies seek e security partners in order to execute their cyber security agenda

the increase in total gross margin for as compared to  was primarily attributable to the decrease of million in 
table of contents amortization of technology related intangible assets expense and the decrease of million in impairment of technology related intangible assets for as compared to these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in the provision of warranty expense in as compared to we believe the increase in gross margin for products in as compared to  after excluding the items mentioned above  can be attributed  in part  to the increase in our software revenue 
our software products have higher gross margins than our other product types  and an increase in software revenue would cause our gross margin from products to increase 
the increase in total gross margin in was also attributable to our efforts to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  combined with an increase in total revenue 
the increase in gross profit from maintenance and professional services in as compared to  was primarily attributable to increased maintenance revenue achieved on decreased customer support costs 
customer support costs decreased due to cost reduction programs implemented over the past two years 
research and development total research and development expenses decreased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for for as compared to  the decrease in research and development expenses of million was primarily due to the decrease in overhead expenses of approximately million offset by the increase in payroll and consulting expenses of approximately million associated with our continued allocation of resources towards investing in our future product offerings 
marketing and selling total marketing and selling expenses decreased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for marketing and selling expenses decreased million in as compared to primarily due to cost reduction measures 
for as compared to  approximately million of the decrease in marketing and selling expenses was from decreased overhead costs associated with cost reduction measures  approximately million of the decrease was from decreased spending on marketing programs  and approximately million of the decrease was from a reduction in bad debt expense 
these reductions were partially offset by approximately million of increased commission expense due to increased revenue 
general and administrative total general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for for as compared to  approximately million of the increase was from increased payroll and overhead costs associated with an increased workforce and increased bonus payouts  and approximately million of the increase for professional fees incurred in connection with on going litigation 
acquisitions during  we completed four acquisitions  which were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since their respective dates of acquisition 
in september  we acquired all of the capital stock of securant  a privately held company that developed the cleartrust web access management solution  for an aggregate of million in cash including acquisition costs 
in may  we acquired all of the capital stock of gi  a privately held company that developed smart card and biometric authentication products  and substantially all of the assets of transindigo  a privately held company that developed real time web access management software products  for an aggregate of million in cash including acquisition costs and litigation expenses 
in february  we acquired all of the capital stock of xcert  a privately held company that developed digital certificate based 
table of contents products for securing e business transactions  for million in cash  including acquisition costs  plus the assumption of all xcert stock options 
allocation of the purchase prices for all four acquisitions completed during were based on estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on independent appraisals 
these allocations were as follows estimated fair values gi and estimated securant xcert transindigo total life in millions assets and liabilities  including cash goodwill intangible assets to years deferred tax liabilities  net in process research and development total purchase price less assumption of stock options less cash acquired net cash paid we recorded an impairment charge of million during to reduce the carrying value of these intangible assets to zero at december  accordingly  we did not record any amortization expense related to these intangible assets after december  as a result of this impairment charge  we reduced the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets to zero at december  pursuant to two separate escrow agreements entered into in connection with the securant acquisition  million of the cash purchase price otherwise payable to securant s shareholders was placed in escrow  pending settlement of any claims for breach of representations  warranties or covenants in the merger agreement 
one escrow agreement put million of the purchase price into an escrow fund 
we received million from this securant escrow fund during the year ended december  in final settlement of outstanding escrow fund claims  which resulted in a decrease to goodwill of million 
the remainder of the escrow fund was released to the selling shareholders during march the second escrow agreement put million of the securant purchase price into an escrow fund 
the remaining unclaimed balance of the million securant escrow fund not subject to a pending claim is scheduled to be released to the selling shareholders during pursuant to an escrow agreement  million of the cash purchase price otherwise payable to gi s stockholders was placed in escrow  pending settlement of any claims for breaches of representations  warranties or covenants in the merger agreement

we released all but million of the xcert escrow fund to the selling stockholders in august we received approximately million from the escrow fund in settlement of certain tax issues during  and the balance of the million was released to the selling stockholders during as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we reclassified in place workforce related intangible assets into goodwill  resulting in an increase to 
table of contents goodwill and a decrease to intangible assets of million 
in addition  upon reclassification of in place workforce related intangible assets to goodwill and determination of indefinite lived assets  we reversed the deferred tax liabilities related to these intangible assets 
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities resulted in a decrease to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of million 
in  we paid million to xcert stockholders upon finalization of the working capital calculation 
the costs of the working capital adjustment has been added to the purchase price of xcert and resulted in an increase to goodwill of million during we incurred litigation expenses in connection with a patent litigation relating to the products acquired in the may acquisition of gi and recorded these expenses as related costs of acquisition 
the costs to defend the gi lawsuit were covered by the escrow fund set aside from the gi purchase price 
the costs of litigation and disbursements from the gi escrow resulted in a net increase to goodwill of million during the amounts allocated to in process research and development ipr d projects were expensed in the quarter that the related acquisition was consummated because technological feasibility of the ipr d projects had not been achieved and there were no alternative future uses 
ipr d expense of million for the year ended december  represents the write off of ipr d in connection with the acquisition of securant  xcert  gi and transindigo 
restructurings during and  we evaluated and initiated restructuring actions in order to consolidate some of our operations  enhance operational efficiency and reduce expenses 
these actions resulted in total restructuring charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
as a result of these ongoing assessments  during we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
these revisions resulted in no net change to our restructuring liability at december  we revised estimates of facility exit charges based upon the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to lower than anticipated operating costs and other direct costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to revisions in anticipated headcount growth 
these revised estimates of excess facility costs resulted in a net increase to facility exit costs of million at december  in addition  we reduced our severance restructuring reserve by million at december  when we determined our remaining severance and other outplacement costs were lower than originally estimated 
we also reduced our restructuring reserve of costs associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets by million at december  when we determined we had no legal and consulting costs remaining in connection with this transaction 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of facility exit costs  costs associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets and the business related to the asset to tfs technology ab tfs  and severance and other costs associated with the reduction of employee headcount 
the restructuring charges include costs of million incurred due to the revision of previously recorded restructuring charges 
included in the restructuring charges are costs of million consisting of facility exit costs and related impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
facility exit costs consist of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to obligations due under certain exited facilities leases which are payable through the remaining unreserved lease obligations related to certain exited facilities amount to million  which represents our estimated sublease income from these facilities from the end of the reserve period to the end of the lease term 
impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures included in facility exit costs are for unamortized leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures that we believe will not be recoverable upon sublease of exited facilities 
total facility exit costs for include costs of million we incurred when we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
we revised the estimates included in facility exit costs due to the extension of the period of time 
table of contents estimated to obtain sublease tenants for certain exited facilities  based on the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to higher than anticipated operating costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to the continued uncertainty and deterioration in the commercial real estate and sublet markets in the boston metropolitan area 
we recorded restructuring charges of million during associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets and the business related to the assets to tfs 
we sold these assets and related business to tfs in exchange in part for tfs s assumption of the liabilities related to the assets and associated business  including the related support obligations and certain employees 
the total number of employees included in this transaction was  of which were employed in research and development and were employed in general and administrative functions 
the total sweden liquidation costs include additional costs of million incurred upon revision of estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
also included in restructuring charges for are severance and other costs associated with the reduction of employee headcount of million for employees  of which were employed in manufacturing  customer operations and technical services  were employed in research and development  were employed in sales and marketing  and employed in general and administrative functions

we recorded facility exit costs consisting primarily of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to minimum lease payments due under a lease agreement 
during  we revised our estimate of these facility exit costs and reduced the reserve for these facility exit costs to zero 

table of contents we expect to pay the remaining restructuring costs accrued at december  as follows year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million interest expense and other interest expense and other includes the following years ended december  in millions interest expense on convertible debentures non cash amortization of deferred financing costs non cash accretion of warrant value interest income net of expense and other unrealized loss from foreign currency translation total interest expense and other interest expense  non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and non cash accretion of warrant value included in interest expense and other were incurred in connection with our convertible debentures which we issued in october and november the increase in interest income net of expense and other in as compared to was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances maintained in as well as a decrease in fixed asset disposals of million in as compared to the unrealized loss from foreign currency translation was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar during income loss from investing activities income loss from investing activities includes the following gains losses years ended december  in millions gain from sale of marketable securities  net income loss from sale of investments decline in fair value of crosby finance  llc investment impairment charges total income loss from investing activities during  we recognized total investment impairment charges of million related to our long term investments in privately held companies 
included in total investment impairment charges in  and as a result of our initiation of a process to sell our equity investments  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reflect the investments at their estimated realizable value  less costs of disposal 
also during  and included in total investment impairment charges  we recorded an impairment charge of million based upon valuations and anticipated cash proceeds to reduce the carrying amount of three investments to their estimated fair value for three companies in which we had invested that were in the process of obtaining additional financing or being sold 
during  we completed the sale of our equity investments and recorded a gain from the sale of approximately million 

table of contents the carrying amount of our interest in crosby was million at december  and  respectively 
we accounted for our investment in crosby under the guidelines of eitf no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
accordingly  we carried our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities 
we determined the fair value of our interest in crosby based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds upon maturity of the variable delivery forward contract vdf 
the decline in fair value of our interest in crosby was million for the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for compared to a benefit of million for our effective tax rate decreased to for from for the decrease in our effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to the increased profitability of our international operations  where the effective tax rates are generally lower than the united states statutory rate 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   consisting primarily of operating cash and short term investments 
this represents a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents due to an investment of million of cash equivalents into marketable securities during the year ended december  cash provided by operations of million during consisted primarily of net income of million and a variety of non cash changes  including depreciation 
working capital increased by million in this was primarily the result of the conversion of million of the principal amount of convertible debentures during  and million in cash provided by operating activities and million provided by financing activities 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and accounts receivable days outstanding calculated as net accounts receivable divided by revenue per day will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and accounts receivable days outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the amount of international sales and length of customer s payment cycle 
we also record deferred maintenance billings as accounts receivable  and the timing of these billings affects the accounts receivable days outstanding 
historically  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our accounts receivable days outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
if the economy deteriorates  we may observe an increase in the length of our customers payment cycle 
to address increases in accounts receivable balance and to improve cash flow  we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables 
discounts offered to customers to encourage payment are deducted from revenue 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and increased estimates for reserves against revenue and will be subject to greater general credit risks 
cash used for investing activities of million during consisted primarily of million of cash used for the purchase of marketable securities and million of cash used to purchase property and equipment and other long term assets  which was partially offset by million of cash provided by the sale and maturities of marketable securities 
our plans for future uses of cash may include acquisitions of other entities or technologies and additional purchases of property and equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures will be primarily for purchases of property and equipment and will aggregate approximately to million for we expect to fund our capital expenditures from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
cash provided by financing activities of million during consisted primarily of proceeds from employee exercises and purchases under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 

table of contents the following are our contractual commitments associated with our lease obligations and restructurings years ending december  thereafter total in millions leases restructurings total commitments we have commitments for various operating leases worldwide that expire at various times through and that are shown below net of existing sublease agreements  excluding facility exit costs included in restructuring charges 
the lease commitments of million shown also include lease commitments of million related to certain exited facilities that have not been reserved for in restructuring charges  which represents our estimated sublease income from these facilities from the end of the period reserved to the end of the lease term 
restructuring commitments shown below are primarily for facility exit costs of up to months of minimum lease payments due under certain excess facilities lease agreements  net of related sublease agreements 
during october and november  we issued convertible subordinated debentures with an aggregate principal amount of million 
in june  a holder of a debenture with a principal amount of million converted the full amount of this debenture into shares of our common stock  which conversions resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and the cancellation of the holder s debenture 
after these conversions the remaining aggregate principal amount of the convertible subordinated debentures was million 
in october  the holders of the remaining outstanding convertible debentures converted the full amount of the debentures into shares of our common stock  which conversions resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and the cancellation of all outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
there were no cash outflows in connection with these conversions 
in connection with the conversions  we paid interest on the debentures in the aggregate amount of million during october now that the debentures have converted to common stock  we are no longer obligated to pay any interest on the debentures in the future 
we currently have no debt nor have found it necessary  given our success in generating cash from operations and our significant liquidity  to obtain a credit facility 
we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  including our restructuring liabilities  through at least the next twelve months 
we anticipate that current cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash generated from the exercise of employee options and employee stock purchase plans will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements in november  we transferred approximately million shares of verisign common stock  which were covered by three forward contracts forwards and one vdf  to crosby finance  llc  of which we were  until december  a member 
crosby was a bankruptcy remote qualified special purpose entity  established specifically to securitize the shares of verisign common stock 
we accounted for the contribution and the transfer as a sale under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  we did not consolidate crosby for accounting purposes 
until december  the counterparty to the vdf contract held the remaining interest in crosby 
on december   we sold our interest in crosby finance to deutsche bank ag for a purchase price of 
million 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  
table of contents quarterly financial data unaudited first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data revenue gross profit income before provision for income taxes net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share revenue gross profit income before provision for income taxes net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share certain factors that may affect future results our operating results tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  can cause these fluctuations  including  among others the size  timing and shipment of individual orders for our products  changes in our operating expenses  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of our products and our competitors products  customers deferring their orders in anticipation of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in product pricing  including changes in competitors pricing policies  development and performance of our direct and indirect distribution channels and changes in the mix of vertical markets to which we sell our products  the amount and timing of charges relating to the impairment or loss of value of some of our assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  the timing of personnel departures and new hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  and general economic conditions 
we may not be able to achieve  sustain or grow our profitability from quarter to quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in when revenue is recognized can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter 
table of contents to quarter 
our business has historically tended to be seasonal  with the last quarter of the year having the highest amount of revenue and the first quarter of the year having the lowest amount of revenue 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
from december  through february  our stock price has ranged from a per share high of to a low of 
a number of factors may contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including our ability to meet the expectations of brokerage firms  industry analysts and investors with respect to our operating and financial results  our public announcements and our competitors public announcements  the public s perception of the strength of the e security solutions market and technology companies generally  litigation developments  the volatility of the stock market in general and of the technology sector in particular  and general economic conditions 
if the market for e security solutions does not continue to grow  then demand for our products may decrease 
the market for some of our e security solutions is continuing to develop  and demand for our products depends on  among other things the perceived ability of our products to address real customer problems  the perceived quality  price  availability and interoperability of our products as compared to our competitors products  the market s perception of how easy or difficult it is to deploy our products  especially in complex  heterogeneous network environments  the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  market acceptance and use of new technologies and standards  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public s perception of the need for secure electronic commerce and communications over both wired and wireless computer networks  the us government s continued focus on e security as a means to counteract terrorism and other hostile acts  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  the market s perception of our products ability to address the e security aspects of various laws  and general economic conditions  which  among other things  influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
unless we keep up with the ongoing changes in e security technology and standards  then our products could become obsolete 
our success depends in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new  competitively priced products and solutions with features that meet changing market requirements  all in a timely and cost effective manner 
a number of factors  including the following  could have a negative impact on the success of our products quality  reliability or security failures  which could result in product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  unexpected service or warranty expenses  reduced orders and a decline in our competitive position  delays or difficulties in product development  
table of contents our competitors introduction of new products or services ahead of our new products or services  or their introduction of superior or cheaper products or services  the availability of free  unpatented implementations of encryption algorithms and security protocols  the market s failure to accept new technologies  including connected authentication devices  smart cards  enterprise strong authentication  web access management  digital certificates and public and private key management  our failure to include features in our products  or obtain industry and governmental certifications  that our customers or us or foreign government regulators may require  our failure to anticipate changes in customers requirements  and the implementation of industry or government standards that are inconsistent with the technology embodied in our products 
to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies or purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 
we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology we need and  if we find such businesses  may not be able to purchase or license the technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
in addition  acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory approvals 
in order to finance a potential transaction  we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders 
some of our products have long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our quarterly operating results 
transactions for some of our products  especially our web access management products  often involve large expenditures by our customers 
the sales cycles for these transactions can be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the need to educate potential customers about our products capabilities  customers willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products  the timing of customers budget cycles  delays caused by customers internal review processes  and for sales to the federal government  federal regulatory  approval and purchasing requirements 
if we fail to obtain a sufficient supply of high quality rsa securid authenticators or components  then we may be unable to fill customer orders or may need to replace defective authenticators shipped to our customers 
problems with the availability or quality of our products could cause our revenue to decrease and our costs to increase  damage our reputation in the marketplace and subject us to damage claims from our customers 
examples of quality and possible availability problems include in and  our quarterly analysis of historical failure and defective return rates indicated that certain rsa securid authenticators produced between and were subject to higher defect and failure rates 
many of our suppliers are located outside of the united states 
if political  economic  health related or natural events  such as the us actions in iraq or the earthquake and tsunami disasters in asia  were to affect international trade  then we could experience difficulties in obtaining product components from our international suppliers 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our product components 
if our existing suppliers were unable to provide us with a sufficient supply of quality components  then we would have to expend significant resources to find new suppliers  and it is possible that we would be unable to find new suppliers in a timely manner 
if we fail to remain competitive  then we could lose market share for our established products or fail to gain market share for our less mature products 
a number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our products at lower prices or at reduced margins  including  among others some of our competitors offer e security products with features and functionality that our products do not currently offer or at a lower price than we offer 
some computer and software companies that have not traditionally offered e security products are now offering free or low cost e security products and functionality bundled with their own computer and software products 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do  allowing them to leverage an installed customer base and distribution network  adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
our industry is undergoing consolidation  with larger firms acquiring some of our competitors 
a larger firm that acquires a competitor may be a greater threat to us than the original  smaller competitor was for the reasons described in the immediately preceding bullet point 
our issued us patents expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
the expiration of some of our patents has also permitted the use and distribution of freeware  free versions of some of our technology  and we believe that some potential customers may be choosing to use freeware instead of buying our products 
many companies have reduced their information technology budgets due to the current economic conditions  which could make competition more intense because we are competing for fewer customer dollars 
international sales make up a significant portion of our business 
international sales accounted for more than of our total revenue in each of the years ended december   and there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including foreign regulatory requirements and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  legal uncertainty regarding liability and the costs of resolving or litigating a dispute internationally  difficulties in the enforcement of intellectual property rights  export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology  difficulties and delays in establishing international distribution channels  the need to tailor or localize our products in order to compete in particular international markets and to comply with foreign laws  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  tariffs and other trade barriers  and political instability 

table of contents during times when the global economy experiences weakness or uncertainty  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
the global economy  especially the technology sector  can be volatile  and an economic slowdown can have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results 
for example  during a period of economic weakness or uncertainty  current or potential customers may defer purchases  go out of business or have insufficient capital to buy or pay for our products 
companies may also reduce their budgets for information technology products and services  which could reduce or eliminate some potential sales of our products and services 
in addition  if our resellers and distributors experience financial difficulties due to an uncertain economy  then we may have difficulty selling to and collecting money from those resellers and distributors 
our excess facilities are costly 
we currently lease a number of excess  unused or under used facilities  and our lease commitments for some of these facilities will not expire for several years 
although we have found sublessees for substantially all of these facilities  if any of our sublessees were to fail to pay their portion of the rent to our landlords due to financial difficulties or for any other reason  then we would be responsible for paying the full rental amount 
if we fail to protect our rights in our proprietary technology  competitors may use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
however  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may nonetheless succeed at copying aspects of our products  obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary  or infringing upon our patents and other proprietary rights 
we rely on patents to protect our proprietary rights in our technology  but patents may not provide complete protection it is possible that any patent that we or our licensors hold might be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or terminated 
it is possible that patent examiners might reject the claims described in our pending or future patent applications 
the laws of some countries in which our products are now  or may in the future be  developed or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
during the life of a patent  third parties may design and sell work around solutions that accomplish the goals of our patented inventions but do not infringe the patents themselves 
our industry is highly litigious 
from time to time  we have been involved in disputes with third parties who allege that our products may infringe intellectual property rights held by the third parties 
any litigation carries a number of significant risks  including litigation is often very expensive  even if it is resolved in our favor  and litigation diverts the attention of management and other resources 
moreover  if a court or other government agency rules against us in any intellectual property litigation  we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses to the infringing technology  or pay significant monetary damages 

table of contents we must establish and maintain strategic relationships 
we need to create relationships with third parties  including some of our competitors  to ensure that our products will interoperate with the third parties products 
if our products do not work with third party products used by our customers and potential customers  then our products could lose or fail to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  one of our business strategies is to enter into strategic marketing alliances or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer population than we could reach alone through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
if we cannot create relationships with strategic partners  then we will need to devote more resources to sales and marketing 
we may not be able to find appropriate strategic partners or may not be able to enter into relationships on commercially favorable terms 
furthermore  the relationships we do enter into may not be successful 
because our strategic relationships are generally non exclusive  our strategic partners may decide to pursue alternative technologies or to develop alternative products in addition to or instead of our products  either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors 
security technologies are under constant attack 
the strength of our cryptographic and other e security technologies is constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
any significant advance in the techniques for attacking e security solutions could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
from time to time  we have learned of attempts by third parties to reverse engineer our products to find vulnerabilities 
if a third party successfully hacks any of our products and makes its findings public  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the published vulnerabilities 
for example  if a third party were to hack our rsa securid solution  then some of our customers could require that we replace some or all of their rsa securid authenticators with authenticators that are more secure 
if we are required to make these replacements or if we cannot address the vulnerabilities in our products in a timely fashion  then our business and operating results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our customers and potential customers could perceive our products as unreliable  making it more difficult for us to sell our products 
we may incur significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at our facilities or at a customer s facilities could result in a product liability claim against us 
a substantial product liability claim against us could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any actual or perceived breach of network or data security  whether or not caused by the failure of one of our products  could hurt our reputation and cause potential customers to turn to our competitors products 
our stockholder rights plan and some provisions of our charter may inhibit potential acquisition bids 
we have a classified board of directors and have also adopted a stockholders rights plan  both of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to complete a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company 
while these provisions are intended to enable our board to maximize stockholder value  they may have the effect of discouraging takeovers that could be in the best interest of certain stockholders and may therefore have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock and preventing changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in the market value of our marketable securities  investments  our common stock and foreign exchange rates 
market fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks 

table of contents our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments are generally high credit quality instruments  primarily us treasury and government agency obligations  taxable municipal obligations and money market investments with the average maturity of the total investment portfolio being two years or less 
for securities where the interest rate is adjusted periodically  the reset or auction date will be used to determine the maximum maturity date 
accordingly  we believe that our potential interest rate exposure in investments is not material 
we also currently have no debt 
accordingly  we have no direct exposure to movements in interest rates 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as our business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relate to sales and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the operations of our foreign subsidiary in ireland are measured using the us dollar as its functional currency  while all of our other foreign branches and subsidiaries operations are measured using the local currencies as the functional currencies 
our sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are primarily billed through ireland and are thus denominated in us dollars 
when we do invoice customers in a non us dollar currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
in ireland  where we invoice our customers in us dollars  we pay our operating expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in the euro relative to the us dollar are reflected directly in our income statement 
we are also exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets
