off balance sheet items finance receivable sales as part of our capital services programs  we have from time to time sold  through securitizations  net finance receivables with limited recourse 
in these transactions  we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph of fas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  and received a cash payment from the transferee 
specifically  the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company 
at the time of sale  we obtained legal counsel s opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law 
under the terms of the sale  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received 
there are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor 
we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
we have accounted for these transactions as a sale  recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale 
any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale 
the maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts 
we believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation  in accordance with paragraph of fas no 
in selective cases  when we have sold net finance receivables  we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors 
the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with gaap  we do not record these amounts as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment 
these contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value  and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers 
at december  and  the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts 
as part of our review of our risk exposure  we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible

financings and capitalization in february  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for issuances of up to billion in debt securities  preferred stock  preference stock  common stock  purchase contracts  depositary shares  warrants and units 
at december   million remained available under the shelf registration statement filed in october with the sec  permitting issuances of up to billion in debt securities  preferred stock and depositary shares 
in april  as part of this shelf registration statement  we established a medium term note program for the issuance of up to billion in aggregate principal  representing the remaining amount available on the shelf at that time 
at december   we had unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities of billion in the us and million outside the us  primarily to support commercial paper issuance 
in november  we issued million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in august these notes bear interest at an annual rate of and pay interest semi annually beginning february this issuance was a reopening of the notes due august  originally issued in august the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock 
in august  we issued million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in august these notes bear interest at an annual rate of and pay interest semi annually beginning february the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper  financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met with cash generated internally  money from existing credit agreements  debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper programs 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes our known contractual obligations at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other noncurrent liabilities of million included in our consolidated balance sheets at december  relate primarily to our non pension postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures during  capital expenditures included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million of rental equipment and related inventories compared with million and million  respectively  in these additions included expenditures for plant and manufacturing equipment and infrastructure improvements as well as investments associated with new accounts at pbms 
the addition of rental equipment relates primarily to postage meters and increased over the prior year due to higher placements of our digital meters during we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately the same as these investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters 
at december   commitments for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment as well as rental equipment for new and replacement programs reflected the items discussed above 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  customer cancellations  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation  and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with gaap 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
we classify our leases in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for leases 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in fas no 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables 
the difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
we have not experienced any material changes to our residual values during  or nor do we expect any material changes to residual values in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
based on historical experience  we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
we base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
in addition  in our capital services programs  we have considered collateral values 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
in our capital services programs  we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms  such as in the event of bankruptcy 
otherwise  we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over days past due or as circumstances warrant 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to make the following assessments we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction 
we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differences in treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we include in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
we assess the probable outcomes of uncertain tax positions 
at any time  our provision for taxes could be impacted by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts 
based on our income from continuing operations before income taxes  a change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately million 
long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally three to years and buildings up to years 
we depreciate rental equipment using the straight line method over estimated useful lives  which is principally three to ten years 
we depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to ten years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which are principally five to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at december  however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use 
however  regulations were issued in november  and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future 
new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology 
significant negative economic or industry trends 
changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets 
significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital 
future terrorist or other actions that significantly impact the volume of mail 
future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
pension benefits assumptions and estimates our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates 
we make assumptions relating to discount rates  rate of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following assumptions relate to our us pension plan  which is our largest plan 
we base our discount rate assumption on rates of return of high quality  long term corporate bonds  including  among others  moody s aa corporate bond yields  with maturities that are consistent with projected cash flows 
accordingly  we lowered our discount rate assumption at december  to from in to reflect market interest rate conditions 
the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of rate of compensation increase was in and our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was in and sensitivity to changes in assumptions discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million delayed recognition principles in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets 
in accordance with this approach we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
investment related risks and uncertainties we invest our pension plans assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the composition of our us pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate investments 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with equity securities  it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results 
new accounting pronouncements in january  fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
our ownership of the equity of pbg qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin no 
pbg was formed with gatx corporation in for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
effective march  as a result  we consolidated the operations of pbg on march  prior to march   we accounted for pbg under the equity method of accounting 
pbg s minority interest of million is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  pbg s nonrecourse debt of million is included in long term debt and notes payable and current portion of long term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december  the consolidation of pbg did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows

the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp no 
states that companies are allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas no 
we are currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides clarification on key elements of the repatriation provision 
we do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
other regulatory matters in december  we received accepted closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs showing income tax adjustments for the to tax years 
the total additional tax for these years is approximately million 
additional tax due for and future tax years in connection with these closing agreements will not materially affect our future results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in addition to the accepted income tax adjustments discussed above  a proposed adjustment related to the tax year remains in dispute  which could result in additional tax of approximately million for that year 
the irs also is proposing similar adjustments for the and future tax years relating to this deficiency 
these adjustments could result in additional tax expense in the range of to million 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these proposed adjustments 
the irs may propose penalties on us with respect to all periods that have been examined 
the irs is in the process of completing its examination of our tax returns for the to tax years and has issued notices of proposed adjustment with respect to capital services leasing transactions entered into in through specifically  the irs is proposing to disallow certain expenses claimed as deductions on the through tax returns 
we anticipate receiving similar notices for other leasing transactions entered into during the audit period 
the irs will likely make similar claims for years subsequent to in future audits with respect to these transactions 
the irs may propose penalties on us with respect to all periods that have been examined 
in addition  in june  the canada revenue agency cra proposed an adjustment for the to tax years  relating to intercompany loan transactions 
the cra may propose penalties on us with respect to all periods that have been examined 
we vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to aggressively contest these matters through applicable irs  cra and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  we have provided for our best estimate of the probable tax liability for these matters and believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years 
however  an unfavorable resolution could have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
at any time  our provision for taxes could be affected by changes in tax law and interpretations by government or courts 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs and the usps meter migration initiatives  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  to an extent  price increases 
earnings performance was helped by currency translation gains of approximately cents per diluted share 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million 
although not affecting income  balance sheet related deferred translation gains of million were recorded in resulting from the stronger british pound  canadian dollar and euro as compared to the us dollar 
similarly  deferred translation gains of million and million were recorded in and the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
at december   we had approximately million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding  all maturing in  to buy or sell various currencies 
risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values  interest and or exchange rates 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividend policy our board of directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since forward looking statements we want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in this form k  other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors 
these forward looking statements are those which talk about the company s or management s current expectations as to the future and include  but are not limited to  statements about the amounts  timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings 
words such as estimate  project  plan  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements 
some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include changes in international or national political conditions  including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions  including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products the company s success at managing customer credit risk  including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions the company s success at managing costs associated with its strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to its business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost  timing and execution of the restructuring plan timing and execution of the meter transition plan regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in our capital services segment continuing developments in the us and foreign airline industry changes in pension and retiree medical costs item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies 
our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
