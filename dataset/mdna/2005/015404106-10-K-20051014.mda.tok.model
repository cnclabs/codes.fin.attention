item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since our inception  we have devoted the vast majority of our resources to the research and development of onconase r and related drug candidates 
we have focused our resources towards the completion of the clinical program for unresectable  or inoperable  malignant mesothelioma 
since onconase r has fast track designation for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma patients  we continue to have meetings and discussions with the fda to establish mutually agreed upon parameters for the new drug application  or nda  to seek marketing approval for onconase r  assuming the phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma yields favorable results 
we received an orphan medicinal product designation for onconase r from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or the emea 
we continue to fulfill the emea requirements regarding the marketing authorization application  or maa registration requirements for onconase r for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma 
almost all of our research and development expenses since our inception of  have gone toward the development of onconase r and related drug candidates 
for the fiscal years  and our research and development expenses were   and  respectively  almost all of which were used for the development of onconase r and related drug candidates 
onconase r is currently in an international  centrally randomized phase iii trial 
the first part of the trial has been completed and the second confirmatory part of the trial is ongoing for which nearly of the patients required per the study design for full patient accrual have now been enrolled 
the primary endpoint of the trial is survival  and as such  a sufficient number of deaths must occur in order to perform the required statistical analyses to determine the efficacy of onconase r in patients with unresectable inoperable malignant mesothelioma 
if the results of the clinical trials are positive  we expect to file for marketing registrations nda and maa for onconase r within six months of completion of the statistical analyses 
however  at this time  we cannot predict with certainty when a sufficient number of deaths will occur to achieve statistical significance 
hence  the timing of when we will be able to file for marketing registrations in the us and eu is data driven 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty what our total cost associated with obtaining marketing approvals will be  or when and if such approvals will be granted  or when actual sales will occur 
we fund the research and development of our products primarily from cash receipts resulting from the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our tax benefits and research products  interest income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
as of july   we believe our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations at least through july  based on our expected level of expenditures in relation to activities in preparing onconase r for marketing registrations and other ongoing operations of the company 
however  we will continue to seek additional financing through equity or debt financings and the sale of net operating loss carryforwards but cannot be sure that we will be able to raise capital on favorable terms or at all 
we may also obtain additional capital through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  although we cannot provide any assurance of such exercises or the amount of capital we will receive  if any 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our operations will be severely curtailed and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
results of operations fiscal years ended july   and revenues we are a development stage company as defined in the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
we are devoting substantially all our present efforts to establishing a new business and developing new drug products 
our planned principal operations of marketing and or licensing of new drugs have not commenced and  accordingly  we have not derived any significant revenue from these operations 
we focus most of our productive and financial resources on the development of onconase r 
we did not have any sales in fiscal  and investment income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  investment income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  these increases were due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents 
research and development research and development expense for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to expenses in connection with preparing our nda for onconase r  including the completion of key toxicology requirements and key requirements for chemistry  manufacturing and controls  including the onconase r stability program of approximately  this increase also resulted from pre clinical sponsored research and development expenses  the new phase ii program for non small cell lung  including consulting fees of approximately  expansion of the confirmatory phase iiib clinical trial in countries outside of the european union  including the retention of another clinical research organization to assure regulatory compliance in the conduct of the trial in these countries  grant payments  clinical monitoring and data management fees related to our pivotal phase iii clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma of approximately  increases in patent expenses of approximately  personnel costs of approximately  and depreciation expense and equipment repairs and maintenance of approximately  offset by a decrease in the non cash expense related to stock options issued for consulting services of approximately  research and development expense for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to increases in data management  clinical research organization fees and clinical expenses related to our pivotal phase iii clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma of approximately  sponsored research and development expenses of approximately  consulting costs of approximately  non cash expense related to stock options issued for consulting services of approximately  offset by a decrease in personnel and insurance expenses of approximately  general and administrative general and administrative expense for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to increases in personnel expenses of approximately  professional fees related to board of directors fees and sarbanes oxley compliance fees of approximately  nasdaq relisting membership fees of approximately  accounting fees of  and depreciation expense of  offset by decreases in non cash expense related to stock and stock options issued for consulting services of approximately  legal expenses of approximately  and computer repairs and maintenance of approximately general and administrative expense for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in non cash expense related to stock and stock options issued for consulting services associated with business development activities of approximately  increases in legal  public relations  personnel  insurance  and accounting expenses of approximately     and  respectively 
interest interest expense for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily due to the maturity and conversion of convertible notes payable into common stock 
interest expense for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to the interest expense on the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes payable and its related warrants issued to unrelated parties 
the interest expense was based on the value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model  amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the notes 
income taxes new jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in new jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits 
for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately  total available tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately  in december  we received approximately  from the sale of the  of tax benefits  which we recognized as tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately  total available tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately  in december  we received approximately  from the sale of the  of tax benefits  which we recognized as tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately  in total available tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately  in december  we received approximately  from the sale of the  of tax benefits  which we recognized as tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  if still available under new jersey law  we will attempt to sell the remaining  of our tax benefits between july  and june  this amount  which is a carryover of our remaining tax benefits from state fiscal year and earlier  may increase if we incur additional tax losses during state fiscal year we cannot estimate  however  what percentage of our saleable tax benefits new jersey will permit us to sell  how much money we will receive in connection with the sale  if we will be able to find a buyer for our tax benefits or if such funds will be available in a timely manner 
net loss we have incurred net losses during each year since our inception 
the net loss for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the cumulative loss from the date of inception  august   to july  amounted to  such losses are attributable to the fact that we are still in the development stage and  accordingly  have not derived sufficient revenues from operations to offset the development stage expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we have reported net losses of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
the loss from date of inception  august   to july   amounts to  we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our tax benefits and research products  and interest income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
during the fiscal year  we had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  which resulted primarily from net cash used in operating activities of  principally for research and development activities  and net cash used in investing activities due to the purchase of property and equipment of  offset by net cash provided by financing activities of  from warrants and stock options exercises of  less  reduction of debt 
total cash resources as of july  were  compared to  at july  our current liabilities as of july  were  compared to  at july   an increase of  the increase was primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses of approximately  mainly for pre clinical studies and clinical trial of approximately  and  respectively  payroll and payroll taxes of approximately  and professional fees of approximately  and a decrease in other accruals of approximately  offset by the maturity and conversion of convertible notes payable of approximately  and a decrease in accounts payable of approximately  the following transactions occurred after july  o in august and september  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants by an unrelated party and stock options by an employee at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we realized gross proceeds of  from these exercises 
our continued operations will depend on our ability to raise additional funds through various potential sources such as equity and debt financing  collaborative agreements  strategic alliances  sale of tax benefits  revenues from the commercial sale of onconase r  licensing of our proprietary rnase technology and our ability to realize revenues from our technology and our drug candidates via out licensing agreements with other companies 
such additional funds may not become available as we need them or be available on acceptable terms 
through july   a significant portion of our financing has been through the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our tax benefits and research products  interest income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
until and unless our operations generate significant revenues  we expect to continue to fund operations from the sources of capital previously described 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need on terms which are acceptable  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms  or at all  we may need to delay certain development activities over the next twelve months 
as of july   we believe our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations at least through july   based on our expected level of expenditures in relation to activities in preparing onconase r for marketing registrations and other ongoing operations of the company 
however  we will continue to seek additional financing through equity or debt financings and the sale of net operating loss carryforwards but cannot be sure that we will be able to raise capital on favorable terms or at all 
we may also obtain additional capital through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  although we cannot provide any assurance of such exercises or the amount of capital we will receive  if any 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our operations will be severely curtailed and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we will continue to incur costs in conjunction with our us and foreign registrations for marketing approval of onconase r 
we are currently in discussions with potential strategic alliance partners to further the development and marketing of onconase r and other related products in our pipeline 
however  we cannot be sure that any such alliances will materialize 
the market price of our common stock is volatile  and the price of the stock could be dramatically affected one way or another depending on numerous factors 
the market price of our common stock could also be materially affected by the marketing approval or lack of marketing approval of onconase r 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of july   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the accounting policies set forth below have been considered critical because changes to certain judgments  estimates and assumptions could significantly affect our financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures during the reporting period 
since some of those estimates are subjective and complex  actual results could differ from those estimates 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
accounting for stock based compensation statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  provides for the use of a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock compensation 
however  sfas also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for stock options granted to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which only requires charges to compensation expense for the excess  if any  of the fair value of the underlying stock at the date a stock option is granted or at an appropriate subsequent measurement date over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock  if such amounts differ materially from the historical amounts 
we have elected to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under opinion pursuant to sfas  shares  warrants or options issued to non employees for services are accounted for based on their fair market value determined using the black scholes option pricing model and in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring of in conjunction with selling goods or services 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for all years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends sfas and will be effective for the company beginning with the fiscal quarter ending october  the new standard will require us to expense employee stock options and other share based payments over the vesting period 
the new standard may be adopted in one of three ways the modified prospective transition method  a variation of the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we are currently evaluating how we will adopt the standard and evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position and results of operations  although we believe such adoption will increase recorded compensation costs in the future 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our equipment operating lease 
below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  payments due by fiscal year and total thereafter operating lease       total contractual cash obligations       risk factors an investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this form k and our other sec filings before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business and operating results could be harmed 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not have a current source of product revenue and may never be profitable 
we are a development stage company and since our inception one of the principal sources of our working capital has been private sales of our common stock 
we incurred a net loss of approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  we have continued to incur losses since july we may never achieve revenue sufficient for us to attain profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
our profitability will depend on our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approvals for  and effectively market onconase r as well as entering into strategic alliances for the development of new drug candidates from the out licensing of our proprietary rnase technology 
the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products involves a number of significant challenges 
in particular our ability to commercialize onconase r depends on the success of our clinical development programs  our efforts to obtain regulatory approval and our sales and marketing efforts or those of our marketing partners  if any  directed at physicians  patients and third party payors 
a number of factors could affect these efforts including o our ability to demonstrate clinically that our products have utility and are safe  o delays or refusals by regulatory authorities in granting marketing approvals  o our limited financial resources relative to our competitors  o our ability to obtain an appropriate marketing partner  o the availability and level of reimbursement for our products by third party payors  o incidents of adverse reactions to our products  o side effects or misuse of our products and unfavorable publicity that could result  and o the occurrence of manufacturing or distribution disruptions 
we will seek to generate revenue through licensing  marketing and development arrangements prior to receiving revenue from the sale of our products 
to date we have not consummated any licensing or marketing arrangements and we may not be able to successfully consummate any such arrangements 
we have entered into several development arrangements  which have resulted in limited revenues for us 
however  we cannot ensure that these arrangements or future arrangements  if any  will result in significant amounts of revenue for us 
we  therefore  are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or the time required to achieve profitability  if at all 
we will need additional financing to continue operations  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if it is available at all 
we need additional financing in order to continue operations  including completion of our current clinical trials and filing marketing registrations for onconase r in the united states with the fda and in europe with the emea 
if the results from our current clinical trial do not demonstrate the efficacy and safety of onconase r for malignant mesothelioma  our ability to raise additional capital will be adversely affected 
even if regulatory applications for marketing approvals are filed  we will need additional financing to continue operations 
as of july   we believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations at least through july   based on our expected level of expenditures 
however  we will continue to seek additional financing through equity or debt financings and the sale of net operating loss carryforwards but cannot be sure that we will be able to raise capital on favorable terms or at all 
we may also obtain additional capital through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  although we cannot provide any assurance of such exercises or the amount of capital we will receive  if any 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our operations will be severely curtailed and our business and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to sell certain state tax benefits in the future and if we are unable to do so  it would eliminate a source of financing that we have relied on in the past 
at july   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that expire from to approximately  expires in the years to 
we also had research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately  that expire from to approximately  expires in the years to 
new jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in new jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits 
the aggregate amount of tax benefits that new jersey allows corporations to sell each state fiscal year july st through june th is determined annually and if new jersey reduces such aggregate amount in any fiscal year we may be unable to sell some or all of our available tax benefits as we have in the past 
in addition  there is a limited market for these types of sales and we may not be able to find someone to purchase our tax benefits for a reasonable price 
our historical results of operations have been improved by our sale of tax benefits and if we continue to generate a limited amount of revenue and are unable in the future to sell our tax benefits  our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately  total available tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately  in december  we received approximately  from the sale of the  of tax benefits  which we recognized as tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately  total available tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately  in december  we received approximately  from the sale of the  of tax benefits  which we recognized as tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  if still available under new jersey law  we will attempt to sell the remaining  of our tax benefits between july  and june  this amount  which is a carryover of our remaining tax benefits from state fiscal year and earlier  may increase if we incur additional tax losses during state fiscal year we can not estimate  however  what percentage of our saleable tax benefits new jersey will permit us to sell  how much money we will receive in connection with the sale  if we will be able to find a buyer for our tax benefits or if such funds will be available in a timely manner 
we cannot predict how long it will take us nor how much it will cost us to complete our phase iii trial because it is a survival study and we are still in patient enrollment in part two of this phase iii trial 
we currently have ongoing a two part phase iii trial of onconase r as a treatment for malignant mesothelioma 
the first part of the clinical trial has been completed and the second  confirmatory part is still ongoing 
the primary endpoint of the phase iii clinical trial is survival  which tracks the length of time patients enrolled in the study live 
according to the protocol  a sufficient number of patient deaths must occur in order to perform the required statistical analyses to determine the efficacy of onconase r in patients with unresectable inoperable malignant mesothelioma 
since it is impossible to predict with certainty when these patient deaths in the phase iii trial will occur  we do not have the capability of reasonably determining when a sufficient number of deaths will occur  nor when we will be able to file for marketing registrations with the fda  emea and tga 
in addition  clinical trials are very costly and time consuming 
the length of time required to complete a clinical trial depends on several factors including the size of the patient population  the ability of patients to get to the site of the clinical study  and the criteria for determining which patients are eligible to join the study 
delays in patient enrollment  could delay achieving a sufficient number of deaths required for statistical analyses  which therefore may delay the marketing registrations 
although we believe we could modify some of our expenditures to reduce our cash outlays in relation to our clinical trials and other nda related expenditures  we cannot quantify which or the amount such expenditures might be modified 
hence  a delay in the commercial sale of onconase r would increase the time frame of our cash expenditure outflows and may require us to seek additional financing 
such capital financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial pre market approval requirements on the introduction of pharmaceutical products 
these requirements involve lengthy and detailed pre clinical and clinical testing and other costly and time consuming procedures 
satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
we cannot apply for fda  emea or tga approval to market onconase r until the clinical trials and all other registration requirements have been met 
if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be allowed to commercialize our drugs and will not generate product revenue 
the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial pre market approval requirements on the introduction of pharmaceutical products 
these requirements involve lengthy and detailed pre clinical and clinical testing and other costly and time consuming procedures 
satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years depending on the level of complexity and novelty of the product 
drugs in late stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy results despite having progressed through initial clinical testing 
while limited trials with our product have produced certain favorable results  we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing of any compound within any specific time period  if at all 
furthermore  the fda or the company may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
in addition  we cannot apply for fda  emea or tga approval to market onconase r until pre clinical and clinical trials have been completed 
several factors could prevent the successful completion or cause significant delays of these trials including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate the product is safe and effective in humans 
also if safety concerns develop  the fda  emea and tga could stop our trials before completion 
all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change by various regulatory agencies  including the fda  in the future  which could affect the cost and duration of our clinical trials 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies would delay our ability to generate product revenues and to raise additional capital and could cause us to be unable to fund the completion of the studies 
we may not market or sell any product for which we have not obtained regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that the fda or other regulatory agencies will ever approve the use of our products that are under development 
even if we receive regulatory approval  such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market our products 
further  even after approval  discovery of previously unknown problems could result in additional restrictions  including withdrawal of our products from the market 
if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we cannot market or sell our products in the united states  or in other countries and our long term viability would be threatened 
if we fail to achieve regulatory approval or foreign marketing authorizations for onconase r we will not have a saleable product or product revenues for quite some time  if at all  and may not be able to continue operations 
we are and will be dependent upon third parties for manufacturing our products 
if these third parties do not devote sufficient time and resources to our products our revenues and profits may be adversely affected 
we do not have the required manufacturing facilities to manufacture our products 
we presently rely on third parties to perform certain of the manufacturing processes for the production of onconase r for use in clinical trials 
currently  we contract with scientific protein laboratories  llc for the manufacturing of ranpirnase protein drug substance from the oocytes  or the unfertilized eggs  of the rana pipiens frog  which is found in the northwest united states and is commonly called the leopard frog 
we contract with ben venue corporation for the manufacturing of onconase r and with cardinal health for the labeling  storage and shipping of onconase r for clinical trial use 
we utilize the services of these third party manufacturers solely on an as needed basis with terms and prices customary for our industry 
our use of manufacturers for ranpirnase and onconase r have been approved by the fda 
we have identified substantial alternative service providers for the manufacturing services for which we contract 
in order to replace an existing service provider we must amend our ind to notify the fda of the new manufacturer 
although the fda generally will not suspend or delay a clinical trial as a result of replacing an existing manufacturer  the fda has the authority to suspend or delay a clinical trial if  among other grounds  human subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury as a result of the replacement manufacturer 
we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture our products if they are approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory agencies and are commercialized 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to the timing  quantity or quality of our products or to supply products on acceptable terms 
because we do not have marketing  sales or distribution capabilities  we expect to contract with third parties for these functions and we will therefore be dependent upon such third parties to market  sell and distribute our products in order for us to generate revenues 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize any product candidates for which we receive fda approval  we expect to rely on established third party strategic partners to perform these functions 
for example  if we are successful in our phase iii clinical trials with onconase r  and are granted marketing approval for the commercialization of onconase r  we will be unable to introduce the product to market without establishing a marketing collaboration with a partner with marketing and distribution capabilities 
to date  we have not entered into any marketing or licensing agreements for onconase r 
we cannot assure you we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with one or more biopharmaceutical or other marketing companies with existing distribution systems and direct sales forces to market any or all of our product candidates  on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  it is likely that we will have limited or no control over the manner in which our product candidates are marketed or the resources devoted to such marketing efforts 
in addition  we expect to begin to incur significant expenses in determining our commercialization strategy with respect to one or more of our product candidates 
the determination of our commercialization strategy with respect to a product candidate will depend on a number of factors  including o the extent to which we are successful in securing collaborative partners to offset some or all of the funding obligations with respect to product candidates  o the extent to which our agreement with our collaborators permits us to exercise marketing or promotion rights with respect to the product candidate  o how our product candidates compare to competitive products with respect to labeling  pricing  therapeutic effect  and method of delivery  and o whether we are able to establish agreements with third party collaborators  including large biopharmaceutical or other marketing companies  with respect to any of our product candidates on terms that are acceptable a number of these factors are outside of our control and will be difficult to determine 
our product candidates may not be accepted by the market 
even if approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities  our product candidates may not achieve market acceptance  which means we would not receive significant revenues from these products 
approval by the fda does not necessarily mean that the medical community will be convinced of the relative safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of our products as compared to other products 
in addition  third party reimbursers such as insurance companies and hmos may be reluctant to reimburse expenses relating to our products 
we depend upon kuslima shogen and our other key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit qualified replacement or additional personnel  which would have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are highly dependent upon our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  kuslima shogen 
kuslima shogen s talents  efforts  personality  vision and leadership have been  and continue to be  critical to our success 
the diminution or loss of the services of kuslima shogen  and any negative market or industry perception arising from that diminution or loss  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
while our other employees have substantial experience and have made significant contributions to our business  kuslima shogen is our senior executive and also our primary supporter because she represents the company s primary means of accessing the capital markets 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  our continued success also is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and scientific personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field 
as our company grows our inability to attract qualified management and scientific personnel could materially adversely affect our research and development programs  the commercialization of our products and the potential revenue from product sales 
we do not have employment contracts with kuslima shogen or any of our other management and scientific personnel 
our proprietary technology and patents may offer only limited protection against infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products 
we own two patents jointly with the united states government 
these patents expire in we also own ten united states patents with expiration dates ranging from to  four european patents with expiration dates ranging from to and one japanese patent that expires in we also own patent applications that are pending in the united states  europe and japan 
the scope of protection afforded by patents for biotechnological inventions is uncertain  and such uncertainty applies to our patents as well 
therefore  our patents may not give us competitive advantages or afford us adequate protection from competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products that are similar to our products  and may design around the claims of our patents 
patent litigation and intellectual property litigation are expensive and our resources are limited 
if we were to become involved in litigation  we might not have the funds or other resources necessary to conduct the litigation effectively 
this might prevent us from protecting our patents  from defending against claims of infringement  or both 
to date  we have not received any threats of litigation  legal actions or negotiations regarding patent issues 
developments by competitors may render our products obsolete or non competitive 
in february  the food and drug administration granted eli lilly company approval to sell its alimta r medication as an orphan drug to treat patients with pleural mesothelioma 
alimta is a multi targeted antifolate that is based upon a different mechanism of action than onconase r 
to our knowledge  no other company is developing a product with the same mechanism of action as onconase r 
however  there may be other companies  universities  research teams or scientists who are developing products to treat the same medical conditions our products are intended to treat 
eli lilly is  and some of these other companies  universities  research teams or scientists may be more experienced and have greater clinical  marketing and regulatory capabilities and managerial and financial resources than we do 
this may enable them to develop products to treat the same medical conditions our products are intended to treat before we are able to complete the development of our competing product 
our business is very competitive and involves rapid changes in the technologies involved in developing new drugs 
if others experience rapid technological development  our products may become obsolete before we are able to recover expenses incurred in developing our products 
we will probably face new competitors as new technologies develop 
our success depends on our ability to remain competitive in the development of new drugs or we may not be able to compete successfully 
we may be sued for product liability 
our business exposes us to potential product liability that may have a negative effect on our financial performance and our business generally 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  exposes us to potential product and professional liability risks which are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of new drugs for humans 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a negative effect on our financial performance and materially adversely affect our business 
we maintain product liability insurance to protect our products and product candidates in amounts customary for companies in businesses that are similarly situated  but our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims 
furthermore  liability insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we cannot be certain that we will always be able to maintain or increase our insurance coverage at an affordable price or in sufficient amounts to protect against potential losses 
a product liability claim  product recall or other claim  as well as any claim for uninsured liabilities or claim in excess of insured liabilities  may significantly harm our business and results of operations 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may significantly interfere with our business 
if we are unable to obtain favorable reimbursement for our product candidates  their commercial success may be severely hindered 
our ability to sell our future products may depend in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products is available from government entities  private health insurers  managed care organizations and others 
third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain their costs 
we cannot predict actions third party payors may take  or whether they will limit the coverage and level of reimbursement for our products or refuse to provide any coverage at all 
reduced or partial reimbursement coverage could make our products less attractive to patients  suppliers and prescribing physicians and may not be adequate for us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our product candidates or compete on price 
in some cases  insurers and other healthcare payment organizations try to encourage the use of less expensive generic brands and over the counter  or otc  products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement policies 
these organizations may make the generic alternative more attractive to the patient by providing different amounts of reimbursement so that the net cost of the generic product to the patient is less than the net cost of a prescription brand product 
aggressive pricing policies by our generic product competitors and the prescription benefits policies of insurers could have a negative effect on our product revenues and profitability 
many managed care organizations negotiate the price of medical services and products and develop formularies for that purpose 
exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the managed care organization patient population 
if our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided  or if those policies increasingly favor generic or otc products  our market share and gross margins could be negatively affected  as could our overall business and financial condition 
the competition among pharmaceutical companies to have their products approved for reimbursement may also result in downward pricing pressure in the industry or in the markets where our products will compete 
we may not be successful in any efforts we take to mitigate the effect of a decline in average selling prices for our products 
any decline in our average selling prices would also reduce our gross margins 
in addition  managed care initiatives to control costs may influence primary care physicians to refer fewer patients to oncologists and other specialists 
reductions in these referrals could have a material adverse effect on the size of our potential market and increase costs to effectively promote our products 
we are subject to new legislation  regulatory proposals and managed care initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our ability to market our products  obtain collaborators and raise capital 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry  including reductions in the cost of prescription products and changes in the levels at which consumers and healthcare providers are reimbursed for purchases of pharmaceutical products 
for example  the prescription drug and medicare improvement act of provides a new medicare prescription drug benefit beginning in and mandates other reforms 
although we cannot predict the full effects on our business of the implementation of this new legislation  it is possible that the new benefit  which will be managed by private health insurers  pharmacy benefit managers and other managed care organizations  will result in decreased reimbursement for prescription drugs  which may further exacerbate industry wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for prescription drugs 
this could harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues 
it is also possible that other proposals will be adopted 
as a result of the new medicare prescription drug benefit or any other proposals  we may determine to change our current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements  any of which could harm our ability to operate our business efficiently  obtain collaborators and raise capital 
we have only recently been relisted on the nasdaq smallcap market and our stock is thinly traded and you may not be able to sell our stock when you want to do so 
from april  when we were delisted from nasdaq  until september   when we were relisted on the nasdaq smallcap market  there was no established trading market for our common stock 
during that time  our common stock was quoted on the otc bulletin board and was thinly traded 
there is no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of the listing requirements necessary to remain relisted on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  our stock remains thinly traded and you may be unable to sell our common stock during times when the trading market is limited 
the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the market price of our common stock  like that of the securities of many other development stage biotechnology companies  has fluctuated over a wide range and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
over the past three years  the sale price for our common stock  as reported by nasdaq and the otc bulletin board has fluctuated from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock could be impacted by a variety of factors  including o announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  o disclosure of the results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials by us or our competitors  o disclosure of the results of regulatory proceedings  o changes in government regulation  o developments in the patents or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us or our competitors  o public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others  o litigation  and o general market conditions in our industry 
in addition  the stock market continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have especially affected the market price of many biotechnology companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
nonetheless  these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
events with respect to our share capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market  or the availability of such shares for sale  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we had  shares of common stock outstanding as of july  the following securities that may be exercised into shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding as of july  o options 
stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
o warrants 
warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
the shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options and warrants are currently registered with the sec or are eligible for sale without any volume limitations pursuant to rule k under the securities act 
our incorporation documents may delay or prevent i the removal of our current management or ii a change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
we are currently authorized to issue  shares of preferred stock 
our board of directors is authorized  without any approval of the stockholders  to issue the preferred stock and determine the terms of the preferred stock 
this provision allows the board of directors to affect the rights of stockholders  since the board of directors can make it more difficult for common stockholders to replace members of the board 
because the board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management  these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current management by the common stockholders 
furthermore  the existence of authorized shares of preferred stock might have the effect of discouraging any attempt by a person  through the acquisition of a substantial number of shares of common stock  to acquire control of our company 
accordingly  the accomplishment of a tender offer may be more difficult 
this may be beneficial to management in a hostile tender offer  but have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or inhibit a stockholder s ability to receive an acquisition premium for his or her shares
