item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company designs  markets  and underwrites specialty commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products for select markets or niches 
the company s operations are classified into three reportable business segments which are organized around its three underwriting divisions the commercial lines underwriting group  which has underwriting responsibility for the commercial multi peril package  commercial automobile and specialty property and inland marine insurance products  the specialty lines underwriting group  which has underwriting responsibility for the professional and management liability insurance products  and the personal lines group  which has responsibility for personal property and casualty insurance products for the manufactured housing and homeowners markets 
the company operates solely within the united states through its regional and field offices 
the company generates most of its revenues through the sale of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance policies 
the commercial insurance policies are sold through the company s five distribution channels which include direct sales  retail insurance agents open brokerage  wholesalers  preferred agents and the internet 
the company believes that consistency in its field office representation has created excellent relationships with local insurance agencies across the country 
the personal insurance policies are almost exclusively sold over the internet via the company s proprietary in touch system 
the company also generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which approximated billion at december  and generated million in gross pre tax investment income during the company utilizes external independent professional investment managers with the objective of realizing relatively high levels of investment income while generating competitive after tax total rates of return within duration and credit quality targets 
management measures the results of operations through monitoring certain measures of growth and profitability  including  but not limited to number of policies written  pricing  risk selection  loss ratio sum of net loss and loss adjustment expenses divided by net earned premiums and expense levels 
although further premium rate increases were realized during  the increases moderated from those realized in the increases resulted primarily from the significant property and casualty industry losses as a result of the tragic terrorist attacks of september   lower interest rates  and diminished risk capacity 
during  the company experienced catastrophe losses attributable to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
these catastrophe losses  as noted in the table below  impacted both the company s personal and commercial lines segments 
loss estimates may still change in the future due in part to the number of claims which have not yet been completely remediated or for which the property covered by the claim has not been repaired 
date of event charley frances ivan jeanne total hurricane in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense estimates personal lines segment commercial lines segment total under the company s catastrophe reinsurance programs in place for these hurricanes  the company had a million pre tax per occurrence loss retention for its personal lines catastrophe losses and a million pre tax per occurrence loss retention for its commercial lines catastrophe losses 
the company s loss retention by hurricane is summarized in the table below charley frances ivan jeanne total hurricane in millions net loss and loss adjustment expense estimates personal lines segment commercial lines segment total the company revised its original estimates as of december  for gross losses due to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne as noted below in millions hurricane charley frances ivan jeanne total change in gross loss estimate increase decrease the higher loss estimate for hurricane frances  which  when combined with the aggregate loss estimates for hurricanes charley and jeanne  resulted in million of hurricane jeanne losses to be in excess of the aggregate million coverage limit available on the million excess million loss layer of the company s catastrophe reinsurance program 
this million of losses is in addition to the company s per occurrence loss retention under its catastrophe reinsurance program 
the additional million in hurricane jeanne losses reduced net income for the fourth quarter by million 
based upon the current catastrophe loss estimates  recoveries for hurricane frances are approaching the limit of the company s catastrophe reinsurance program 
catastrophe reinsurance recoveries available to the company for development on hurricane frances beyond current estimates are dollar for dollar for approximately the next million of additional increase in catastrophe losses  and of the next million of additional increase in catastrophe losses 
because of the interaction of the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf and the company s open market reinsurance program  development on hurricane charley would reduce the coverage limit available from the fhcf for hurricane frances 
additionally since the hurricane losses currently exceed the aggregate million coverage limit available on the million excess million coverage loss layer of the company s catastrophe reinsurance program  each dollar of additional development on hurricane charley in this layer would diminish coverage available for hurricane jeanne losses and result in approximately an additional 
of losses being retained by the company 
due to the multiple hurricane events the company purchased additional reinsurance coverages to supplement the original catastrophe reinsurance coverage in which was utilized 
these multiple hurricane events resulted in accelerating the recognition of million in catastrophe reinsurance premium expense as a result of utilizing certain of the catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
of this million in accelerated reinsurance premium expense  million of the accelerated premium expense was attributable to the additional reinsurance coverages which were purchased 
as a result of the active hurricane season there have been a small number of insurers that have announced their intention to either withdraw from the florida marketplace or reduce homeowners and related product writings 
the company doesn t believe these events will have a material impact on its marketing plan 
however  the company plans to shift its product mix by reducing manufactured housing product policies and increasing homeowners product policies 
the company plans to reduce its manufactured housing exposures by restricting new business and further limiting exposure concentrations 
although one florida company has declared insolvency as a result of losses incurred during the hurricane season  the company is not aware of any pending assessment from the florida insurance guarantee association figa to pay for losses resulting from the insolvency 
any assessment from figa is recoverable through policy surcharges 
additionally  citizens property insurance company cpic is the florida market mechanism for homeowners coverage 
cpic experienced significant losses from the hurricanes and has indicated the possibility of an assessment 
as of this date no assessment has been levied  and any such cpic assessment will be recoverable through policy surcharges 
gross written premium growth was strong during across all the company s business segments with in force policy counts increasing  and for the commercial  specialty and personal lines segments  respectively 
weighted average premium rate increases on renewal business approximated  and for the commercial  specialty and personal lines segments  respectively 
commercial specialty personal s in millions lines lines lines total gross written premium gross written premium percentage increase weighted average premium rate increase on renewal business weighted average premium rate increase on renewal business the company believes its core strategy of adhering to an underwriting philosophy of sound risk selection and pricing discipline  a mixed marketing platform for its product distribution and the creation of value added features not typically found in property and casualty products have also contributed to generating premium growth above industry averages  as well as enabling the company to produce combined ratios the sum of net loss and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  divided by net earned premiums well below industry averages 
the gaap combined ratio for the year ended december  was  which  once again  was substantially lower than the property and casualty industry as a whole 
included in the calendar year net loss and loss adjustment expenses was million of prior accident year development 
the following table illustrates the calendar year and accident year loss ratios by segment 
commercial specialty personal weighted lines lines lines average calendar year net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio accident year net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in october   the new york attorney general s office filed a complaint in new york state court against marsh mcclennan companies  inc marsh  the nation s largest insurance broker 
the complaint accuses marsh of participating in bid rigging schemes and improper disclosure to its customers of the fact that marsh was receiving contingent commissions from insurers which issued insurance policies to such customers 
these commissions are based on the volume and or profitability of business placed by marsh 
the complaint also asserted that a number of insurers engaged in bid rigging 
shortly after this complaint was filed  marsh and a number of the insurers named in the complaint publicly announced that they would be terminating their contingent commission arrangements 
marsh has agreed to pay a significant amount in settlement of the matters referred to in the complaint 
the pennsylvania insurance department and insurance regulatory agencies in other states are currently reviewing this practice 
one or more of such agencies may in the future issue regulations concerning the payment of contingent commissions and or the disclosure thereof to customers 
in  the company  as well as many other pennsylvania domiciled insurance companies  received an inquiry from the pennsylvania insurance department requesting information concerning compensation and other arrangements with our brokers and agents  and the company has responded to that inquiry 
insurance regulatory agencies are likely to impose requirements on the insurance industry with respect to the payment of contingent commissions and or the disclosure of contingent commissions to customers and proposed customers 
if these requirements are imposed  they may impact the manner in which the company compensates its brokers and may have an impact on the company s business 
in november  the national association of insurance commissioners executive task force on broker activities proposed model legislation that would impose disclosure requirements on brokers  and would require brokers to obtain the insured s written consent before receiving compensation from an insurance company for the same transaction 
the california and oregon insurance departments have also proposed new regulations which would require disclosure of brokerage fees to customers  and would require brokers to advise clients regarding the best available insurer 
the company has arrangements with approximately agents and brokers collectively preferred agents under which the company pays profit share based on the profitability to the company of business placed by these preferred agents with the company 
approximately of the company s gross written premiums are produced through preferred agents with which the company has profit share arrangements 
it is possible that the filing of the complaint against marsh and the settlement thereof and or future legislation  regulations and or case law could affect these arrangements 
the company is not able at this time to predict the impact of such matters  if any  on the company

investments the company s investment objective is the realization of relatively high levels of after tax net investment income while generating competitive after tax total rates of return within a prudent level of risk and within the constraints of maintaining adequate securities in amount and duration to meet cash requirements of current operations and long term liabilities  as well as maintaining and improving the company s am best rating 
the company utilizes external independent professional investment managers for its fixed maturity and equity investments 
these investments consist of diversified issuers and issues  and as of december   approximately and of the total invested assets total investments plus cash equivalents on a cost basis consisted of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities  respectively  versus and  respectively  at december  of the total investments in fixed maturity securities  asset backed  mortgage pass through  and collateralized mortgage obligation securities  on a cost basis  amounted to million  million and million  respectively  as of december  and million  million and million  respectively  as of december  the asset backed  mortgage pass through  and collateralized mortgage obligation investments are amortizing securities possessing favorable prepayment risk and or extension profiles 
the company regularly performs various analytical procedures with respect to its investments  including identifying any security whose fair value is below its cost 
upon identification of such securities  a detailed review is performed for all securities  except interests in securitized assets  meeting predetermined thresholds to determine whether such decline is other than temporary 
if the company determines a decline in value to be other than temporary  based upon its detailed review  or if a decline in value for an equity investment has persisted continuously for nine months  the cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value 
the factors considered in reaching the conclusion that a decline below cost is other than temporary include  but are not limited to whether the issuer is in financial distress  the performance of the collateral underlying a secured investment  whether a significant credit rating action has occurred  whether scheduled interest payments have been delayed or missed  whether changes in laws and or regulations have impacted an issuer or industry  an assessment of the timing of a security s recovery to fair value  and an ability and intent to hold the security to recovery of fair value 
the amount of any write down is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose 
this evaluation resulted in non cash realized investment losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company attributes these other than temporary declines in fair value primarily to issuer specific conditions  except for as noted in the following paragraph 
during the company s investment committee the committee engaged an investment consulting firm under a full service retainer relationship 
the committee initially directed the investment firm to review the company s common stock portfolio and managers with respect to style  diversification and performance 
based upon the results of this review and recommendations of the investment firm  the committee conducted an investment manager search for a large cap growth and large cap value manager 
upon conclusion of the interview process the committee  in december  decided to change three of its current common stock managers and engaged a new large cap growth and large cap value manager 
as a result of this decision million in non cash investment losses was realized in the fourth quarter due to writing down certain common stock securities  for which there was no longer an intent to hold such securities to recovery of cost 
additionally  the company conducts its impairment evaluation and recognition for interests in securitized assets in accordance with the guidance provided by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board the eitf 
under this guidance  impairment losses on securities must be recognized if both the fair value of the security is less than its book value and the net present value of expected future cash flows is less than the net present value of expected future cash flows at the most recent estimation date 
if these criteria are met  an impairment charge  calculated as the difference between the current book value of the security and its fair value  is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose 
this evaluation resulted in non cash realized investment losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these non cash realized investment losses were from investments primarily in collateralized bond obligations which were impacted by recent years non investment grade default rates that were higher than historic averages and from investments in other asset backed securities which experienced extension of cash flows on the underlying collateral 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio amounted to  million and  million  as of december  and december   respectively  of which and of the portfolio as of december  and december   respectively  was comprised of investment grade securities 
the company had fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses amounting to million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
of these amounts  interests in securitized assets had unrealized losses amounting to million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
this decrease in fixed maturity unrealized losses between december  and december  can be largely attributed to the impairment losses on interests in securitized assets recognized in the third quarter of the remaining unrealized losses are attributable largely to market price changes due to interest rate increases  since the investments were purchased  and are not considered to be other than temporary impairments  given the ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery 
as discussed above  the company s impairment evaluation and recognition for interests in securitized assets is conducted in accordance with the guidance provided by the eitf 
the following table identifies the period of time securities with an unrealized loss at december  have continuously been in an unrealized loss position

no issuer of securities or industry represents more than and  respectively  of the total estimated fair value  or and  respectively  of the total gross unrealized loss included in the table below 
as mentioned above  there are certain risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s impairment methodology  including  but not limited to  the financial condition of specific industry sectors and the resultant effect on any such underlying security collateral values and changes in accounting  tax  and or regulatory requirements which may have an effect on either  or both  the investor and or the issuer 
should the company subsequently determine a decline in the fair value below the cost basis to be other than temporary  the security would be written down to its fair value and the difference would be included in earnings as a realized loss for the period such determination was made

liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses gross basis million and million as of december  and  respectively  net basis million and million as of december  and  respectively reflects the company s best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related settlement expenses with respect to insured events 
based upon the past ten year experience the estimate for the net liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses has been redundant by as much as and deficient by as much as 
the process of establishing the liability for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is a complex and imprecise process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
this liability includes an amount determined on the basis of claim adjusters evaluations with respect to insured events that have occurred and an amount for losses incurred that have not been reported to the company 
in some cases significant periods of time  up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss and the reporting of such to the company 
estimates for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on management s assessment of known facts and circumstances  review of past loss experience and settlement patterns  and consideration of other factors such as legal  social  and economic developments 
these estimates are reviewed regularly and any adjustments resulting therefrom are made in the accounting period in which the adjustment arose 
deferred acquisition costs policy acquisition costs million and million as of december  and  respectively which include commissions net of ceding commissions  premium taxes  fees  and certain other costs of underwriting policies  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to the estimated amounts recoverable after providing for losses and expenses that are expected to be incurred  based upon historical and current experience 
anticipated investment income is considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the deferred costs are continually reviewed by the company  and any adjustments therefrom are made in the accounting period in which the adjustment arose 
goodwill the carrying amount of goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to an annual impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any 
this annual test is performed at december of each year or more frequently if events or circumstance change that require the company to perform the impairment analysis on an interim basis 
goodwill impairment testing requires the evaluation of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill  and recording of an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based on management s best estimate  which generally considers the unit s expected future cash flows 
the primary assumptions used in the expected future cash flow calculations include premium growth and premium rates  loss ratios  expenses  reinsurance rates and discount rates 
should the assumptions used in the calculation of the expected future cash flows differ substantially from the actual results the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting unit could fall below its carrying value and result in the recognition of an impairment loss
