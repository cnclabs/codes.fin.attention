overview of our business we are an international provider of credit enhancement as well as other products that promote homeownership and facilitate mortgage transactions in the capital markets 
we divide our business into four segments us mortgage insurance operations 
we offer mortgage insurance products in the us that enable borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages 
net income from us mortgage insurance operations was million in and million in  and includes pmi mortgage insurance co 
and its affiliated us mortgage insurance and reinsurance companies collectively  pmi  and equity in earnings from pmi s joint venture  cmg mortgage insurance company 
international operations 
we offer mortgage insurance and other credit enhancement products in australia  new zealand  europe and hong kong 
net income from our international operations segment was million in and million in financial guaranty 
we are the lead investor in fgic corporation  whose subsidiary  financial guaranty insurance company  or fgic  provides primary financial guaranty insurance 
we also have a significant interest in ram reinsurance company  ltd  or ram re  a financial guaranty reinsurance company based in bermuda 
net income from our financial guaranty segment was million in and million in other 
our other segment consists of our holding company and contract underwriting operations  equity in earnings losses from sps holding corp  or sps  and certain limited partnerships  and the discontinued operations of our former title insurance subsidiary  american pioneer title insurance company  or aptic 
on march   we completed the sale of aptic  which generated 
table of contents million in cash proceeds and an after tax gain of million 
accordingly  there were no results of operations related to aptic in the last three quarters of our other segment generated a net loss of million in and million in our goal is to become a global provider of credit enhancement products across multiple asset and risk classes and to continue to diversify our product offerings beyond mortgage insurance  while at the same time expanding our mortgage insurance product offerings 
the percentage of our consolidated revenues generated by our international operations and financial guaranty segments increased to in  from in and in revenues and expenses our revenues from continuing operations consist primarily of premiums earned on our us and international mortgage insurance policies and credit enhancement products  net investment income on our investment portfolios  equity in earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries  and other income  including fees from contract underwriting services 
our revenues in were reduced by a realized capital loss on our equity investment held for sale 
our expenses consist primarily of claims paid to policyholders  claims related expenses and changes in reserves  amortization of deferred policy acquisitions costs  underwriting  acquisition and policy servicing costs  contract underwriting costs and remedies  and general administration and overhead expenses  interest and financing expenses  and income taxes 
conditions and trends affecting our business overview of financial results our consolidated net income was million in compared to million in our consolidated net income from continuing operations in was million and increased by compared to see results of operations table below 
the increase in consolidated income from continuing operations after taxes was primarily due to increases in in our equity in earnings from fgic  premiums earned and net investment income  particularly from our international operations  and the slight profitability of sps in compared to its losses in the increases were partially offset by higher losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  and other underwriting and operating expenses  primarily from us mortgage insurance operations  a million pre tax realized capital loss on our equity investment in sps  and an increase in our interest expense as a result of long term debt that we issued in the fourth quarter of approximately of our consolidated total revenues in consisted of interest and dividend income associated with our consolidated investment portfolio of billion 
accordingly  the performance of corporate and municipal bond and securities markets in the us  australia and europe can significantly affect our consolidated financial results 
our primary goal in managing our investment portfolios is to achieve a predictable level of income while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and the preservation of capital 
growth of the 
table of contents portfolio and minimizing the realization of taxable gains are secondary considerations 
a substantial portion of our consolidated investment portfolio consists of investment grade fixed income securities 
trends and conditions affecting financial performance us mortgage insurance operations 
the financial performance of our us mortgage insurance operations segment is affected by a number of factors  including policy cancellations and persistency 
low interest rates in and resulted in heavy mortgage refinance activity and caused pmi s policy cancellations to increase  which in turn negatively affected pmi s insurance in force 
while policy cancellations negatively affect pmi s insurance in force  cancellations due to borrower prepayments positively affect premiums earned on pmi s single premium policies in the year in which the cancellations occur 
upon notification of cancellation of a loan under a non refundable single premium policy  any unearned premium with respect to that loan is recognized as earned premium 
pmi s persistency rate  the percentage of insurance in force at the beginning of a month period that remains in force at the end of that period  was at december  compared to at december  while interest rates remain at affordable levels  the improvement in pmi s persistency rate at december  compared to december  resulted from a stabilization of mortgage interest rates and corresponding decline in refinance activity in if these trends continue in  and particularly if mortgage interest rates increase  we believe that pmi s persistency rate will continue to improve 
new insurance written niw 
pmi s niw decreased by in compared to pmi s ability to write new mortgage insurance is directly affected by  among other factors  the sizes of the us mortgage origination  purchase money mortgage  and private mortgage insurance markets 
the sizes of the us mortgage origination and private mortgage insurance markets decreased in compared to as a result of a decline in refinancing activity in we expect mortgage originations and refinance activity to decline and the percentage of purchase money mortgage transactions to increase in if us mortgage interest rates remain stable or increase 
increased use of alternatives to private mortgage insurance  such as piggyback  or loans  also negatively affected the size of the private mortgage insurance market and pmi s niw in we believe that the use of such loans  which include a first mortgage lien with an ltv of and a second mortgage lien of between and  has increased in the last three years and may continue to do so in credit and portfolio characteristics 
pmi s niw and insurance in force in consisted of higher percentages of adjustable rate mortgages  or arms  alt a loans and high loan to value  or ltv  loans 
we consider a loan alt a if it has a credit  or fico  score of or greater and has certain characteristics such as reduced documentation verifying the borrower s income  deposit information or employment 
we believe that pmi s increases reflect the higher concentrations of arms  alt a and high ltv loans in the mortgage origination and private mortgage insurance markets 
we believe that these market trends will continue in  particularly if mortgage interest rates increase 
we expect higher default and claim rates for arms  alt a and high ltv loans and incorporate these assumptions into our pricing and loss and claim estimates 
pmi s losses and claims 
pmi s claims paid including lae increased by in compared to primarily as a result of the aging of pmi s insurance portfolio and higher claim rates associated with the portion of pmi s portfolio that contains less than a quality loans with fico scores less than and alt a loans 
we expect a significant majority of pmi s mortgage insurance claims with respect to its current portfolio to occur between the second and fourth years after loan origination 
approximately of pmi s insurance in force at december  was written after january  we expect pmi s total losses and lae to increase in compared to due to the seasoning of pmi s insurance portfolio  particularly the book year which represents of pmi s primary insurance in force  the higher average loan size of pmi s portfolio and higher claim rates associated with arms  alt a  high ltv and less than a quality loans 
we expect that the impact of the seasoning of 
table of contents the and earlier book years on total losses and lae will be greatest in  with some continued impact in however  changes in economic conditions  including mortgage interest rates  us unemployment and job creation  could significantly impact our total losses and lae and our estimates 
in addition  changes in economic conditions may not necessarily be reflected in pmi s loss development in the quarter or year in which such changes occur 
captive reinsurance 
captive reinsurance is a reinsurance product in which pmi shares some of its risk written on loans originated by certain lender customers 
in return  a portion of pmi s gross premiums written is ceded to the captive reinsurance companies of those lender customers 
at december   of pmi s insurance in force was subject to captive reinsurance agreements  compared to at december  the captive reinsurance activity was due to refinance activity in and resulting in heavy cancellations of policies not subject to captive reinsurance and a higher percentage of niw being generated by lenders with captive reinsurance agreements 
we expect that the percentage of our insurance in force that involves captive reinsurance will increase in underwriting and operating expenses 
the profitability of our business depends in part on our ability to control our underwriting and operating expenses 
our expense ratio  the ratio of underwriting expenses to net premiums written  in our us mortgage insurance operations segment has been adversely affected by lower persistency from historical levels  which has reduced pmi s premiums written  and by the increased use of captive reinsurance  which decreases premiums written without fully offsetting decreases in underwriting expenses 
regulatory and legislative environment 
at any point in time  there are multiple proposals and initiatives for statutory and regulatory changes that may significantly affect the mortgage insurance industry as well as pmi s business 
we may also be impacted by changes in statutes and regulations affecting the gses  including changes to the risk based capital rules and as a result of changes in the gses eligibility guidelines 
international operations 
factors affecting the financial performance of our international operations segment include pmi australia 
pmi australia s niw and insurance in force increased during compared to  positively affecting consolidated premiums earned and net investment income 
the increases in niw and insurance in force were also positively affected by exchange rate fluctuations and favorable economic conditions in the australian and new zealand economies 
pmi australia s mortgage insurance coverage is typically purchased with a single  lump sum premium 
accordingly  policy cancellations do not negatively impact pmi australia s revenues  but rather decrease its overall claim risk and increase its net premiums earned 
pmi australia s net income also continued to be positively impacted by the low level of reported defaults and decreases in its losses and lae due to a strong housing market  low interest rates and low unemployment 
we expect the rate of australian home price appreciation to moderate in the australian and new zealand economies performed well in and pmi australia s results are closely tied to economic developments in those countries 
pmi europe 
pmi europe s net income and premiums earned increased in compared to primarily as a result of its fourth quarter acquisition of a portion of the uk lenders mortgage insurance portfolio of royal sun alliance  or r sa and the positive performance associated with pmi europe s various credit default swaps 
under the terms of the agreement  pmi europe and r sa share certain economic benefits if loss performance performs to certain target levels 
due to better than expected loss experience on the r sa portfolio  we anticipate increased profit commission accruals in pmi europe s ability to expand its business in the uk and elsewhere in europe depends on several factors 
these factors include lender expectations of future mortgage losses and the degree to which pmi europe s products are accepted in europe s secondary mortgage market and recognized as a method to reduce capital requirements with respect to the new basel capital accord basel ii  which is expected to become applicable to european banks starting in 
table of contents foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the performance of international operations is subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the reporting currency of the us dollar and the functional currencies of the australian dollar and the euro 
the change in the average foreign currency exchange rates from favorably impacted our international operations net income by million  primarily due to appreciation of the australian dollar 
this foreign currency translation impact is calculated using the year over year change in the average monthly exchange rates to the current period ending net income in the local currencies 
in the second quarter of  we purchased foreign exchange put options at a cost of million to mitigate the negative effects of a potential strengthening us dollar relative to either the australian dollar or the euro in we entered into a similar foreign exchange put program in january at a pre tax cost of million 
financial guaranty 
factors affecting the financial performance of our financial guaranty segment include fgic corporation 
the significant portion of our net income derived from our financial guaranty segment was generated by equity in earnings from fgic corporation 
factors affecting fgic corporation s financial performance include interest rate movements  which may generate refundings  the level of public financings  and fgic s ability to expand into new markets 
ram re 
ram re s net income increased in in comparison to primarily due to increases in premiums earned and investment income  offset by increases in underwriting and operating expenses and amortization of policy acquisition costs 
other 
factors affecting the financial performance of our other segment include sps formerly fairbanks capital holding corp we recorded million in equity in earnings relating to sps in compared to a million loss in in september  sps recorded million pre tax in charges in connection with its settlement of potential civil charges by the ftc and hud  settlement of certain putative class action litigation  and estimated costs relating to certain state regulatory actions 
in january  we signed a summary of terms with credit suisse first boston usa  inc  or csfb  pursuant to which csfb received an option to acquire of our outstanding stock of sps 
based upon the transaction  for the fourth quarter of we recorded an after tax million realized capital loss on our equity investment in sps  and classified our remaining carrying value in sps as equity investment held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
we will record future equity in earnings or losses from sps in other income 
contract underwriting services

the increase in premiums earned in over was attributable primarily to increases in premiums earned by our international operations and us mortgage insurance operations 
pmi australia s premiums earned increased as a result of growth in its business and the continued weakening of the us dollar relative to the australian dollar 
us mortgage insurance operations premiums earned increased primarily as a result of higher average premium rates in and the release of million of unearned premiums to earned premiums in the second half of this release of unearned premiums was caused by loan cancellations reported in the third and fourth quarters of relating to a non refundable  single premium policy executed in pmi europe s premiums earned increased in by approximately million compared to primarily as a result of its acquisition of the r sa mortgage insurance portfolio in the fourth quarter of the increase in consolidated premiums earned in over was attributable primarily to increases in pmi australia s premiums earned  offset by cumulative adjustments for ceded premiums of million recorded in the fourth quarter of in our us mortgage insurance operations 
the increase in net investment income in over was due primarily to growth in our investment portfolio  partially offset by a decrease in our book yield related to our us investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio grew primarily as a result of excess cash flows from operations and the sale of aptic

in  our investment portfolio grew primarily as a result of excess cash flows from operations  partially offset by our investment in fgic in december as of december   our consolidated pre tax book yield was compared to as of december  this decline reflects the reinvestment of maturing  higher yielding securities into lower yielding securities in our us investment portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of  we made adjustments to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment related to the accretion of discounts and call premiums on us municipal bonds that had been refunded 
the adjustment related to the periods through and included a reclassification of million of net realized gains to interest income as well as a positive yield adjustment of million to reflect the accretion of purchase discounts and call premiums 
the net effects of these adjustments recorded in were an increase in net investment income of million and a decrease in net realized investment gains of million 
we account for our unconsolidated strategic investments and limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
the increase in equity in earnings from our unconsolidated strategic investments in over was due primarily to our investment in fgic corporation in december and our resulting equity in earnings from fgic corporation of million in the increase in equity in earnings from unconsolidated strategic investments in was also due to a small profit at sps in compared to losses in equity in earnings from sps was million in  a change of million from the losses in were largely a result of sps charges of million pre tax in connection with its settlement of potential civil charges by the federal trade commission  or ftc  and us department of housing and urban development  or hud  settlement of certain putative class action litigation  and estimated costs relating to certain state regulatory actions

contract underwriting activity decreased during due to a decline in the refinance market 
the results of our contract underwriting operations are included in our other segment 
the increase in our losses and lae in over was due primarily to higher claims paid in us mortgage insurance operations and a reserve reversal in the third quarter of in international operations 
the increase in losses and lae in over was the result of an increase in claims paid in our us mortgage insurance operations and an increase in loss reserves for pmi europe  partially offset by a reduction of loss reserves for pmi australia 
the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses in over was due primarily to higher operating expenses in our us mortgage insurance operations  including recognition of expenses previously deferred as acquisition costs  higher compensation and related expenses and expenses related to pmi s field operations restructuring 
increases in pmi australia s payroll and payroll related expenses  primarily due to increased employee head count  and profit and exchange commissions related to pmi australia s captive reinsurance arrangements also contributed to the increase in our consolidated other underwriting and operating expenses in compared to the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses in over was due largely to the increases in underwriting and operating expenses in our us mortgage insurance operations and pmi australia and an increase in remedy expenses in our contract underwriting operations 
the increase in interest expense and distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in compared to was due to the inclusion of a full year s interest expense on the equity units we issued in november the increase in interest expense in compared to was also due to the equity units 
our income tax expense from continuing operations in decreased by compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in the effective tax rate to from  offset by an increase in pre tax income from continuing operations

the decreases in gross and net premiums written in were offset by an increase in pmi s average premium rate caused by higher percentages of polices with deeper coverage and policies on arms and high ltv loans  in than in the increases in ceded premiums in and were driven primarily by increases in gross premiums written excluding the million single premium policy received in  higher average premium rates and increasing percentages of primary insurance in force subject to captive reinsurance agreements 
primary insurance in force refers to the current principal balance of all primary insured mortgage loans as of a given date 
as of december   of primary insurance in force and of risk in force were subject to captive reinsurance agreements  compared to and at december  and and at december   respectively 
these increases are the result of a higher portion of new insurance written with customers with whom we have captive reinsurance agreements 
we anticipate that higher levels of captive reinsurance cessions will continue to reduce pmi s net premiums written and earned  and that pmi s primary risk in force subject to captive reinsurance agreements will continue to increase as a percentage of total risk in force 
during the fourth quarter of  we made cumulative adjustments to ceded premiums of million pre tax  which decreased premiums earned

the increase in the number of primary claims paid in was due to a number of factors  including the seasoning of our primary insurance portfolio and higher claim rates associated with the portion of pmi s portfolio that contains less than a quality and alt a loans 
see credit and portfolio characteristics  below 
the decrease in the average primary claim size in compared to was primarily the result of continued home price appreciation and pmi s loss mitigation efforts 
primary claims paid increased to million in compared to million in and million in pool insurance claims paid increased to million in from million in changes in net loss reserves increased in compared to due to an increase in pmi s primary loans in default inventory 
total losses and lae represent management s best estimate of our future claim payments and costs to process those claims relative to our current inventory of loans in default 
as discussed above  the increase in total losses and lae in compared to was a function of the seasoning of our primary insurance portfolio and higher claim rates associated with the less than a quality and alt a loans 
we expect a significant majority of claims on insured loans in pmi s current portfolio to occur between the second and fourth years after loan origination  and of pmi s insurance in force at december  was written after january  accordingly  we expect pmi s total losses and lae in to be higher than as a result of the seasoning of the us portfolio  particularly the book year which represents of pmi s primary insurance in force 
in addition  to the extent we continue to have high levels of our insurance in force that are in or approaching their peak loss development years  total incurred losses may continue to increase from prior periods 
however  estimates of total losses and lae are derived primarily by notices of default which are impacted by economic conditions such as us unemployment and job creation rates 
changes in economic conditions could significantly impact our total losses and lae and our estimates 
in addition  changes in economic conditions may not necessarily be reflected in pmi s loss development in the quarter or year in which such changes occur 
the increases in claims paid including lae and total losses and lae in compared to were due to increases in the average primary claim size  the percentage of delinquent loans going to claim  the total number of primary loans in default and the seasoning of our modified pool and bulk loans acquired in and the increase in the average primary claim size was the result of increases in the average principal balance of loans and deeper coverage amounts  principally on bulk loans which represented a larger percentage of all claims in than in pool claims paid were million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the seasoning of pmi s modified pool portfolio 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we assessed the reasonableness of our estimate of reserves for lae 
as a result of this assessment  we decreased pmi s lae reserves by approximately million and reduced the allocation of claim related expenses from operating expenses to lae 
pmi s case and incurred but not reported reserves were increased by approximately the same amount of the reduction to lae reserves according to our best estimate for loss reserves as of june  for a discussion of changes in net loss reserves  see critical accounting policies and estimates  reserves for losses and lae  below 
pmi s primary mortgage insurance master policies define default as the borrower s failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage 
generally  the master policies require an insured to notify pmi of a default no later than the last business day of the month following the month in which the borrower becomes three monthly payments in default 
for reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the borrower has missed two consecutive payments

bulk loans in default and the bulk default rate decreased in as a result of certain bulk loan transactions having experienced their peak loss development in prior periods 
the default rates for bulk transactions at december   and remained higher than the overall primary default rates due primarily to the higher concentration of less than a quality and alt a loans in pmi s bulk portfolio 
pmi s modified pool default data are presented in the table below 
as of december  modified pool with deductible loans in default policies in force default rate modified pool without deductible loans in default policies in force default rate total modified pool loans in default policies in force default rate 
table of contents the increase in the total modified pool default rate was driven by both an increase in modified pool loans in default due to the seasoning of the modified pool portfolio and a decrease in the number of modified pool policies in force 
pmi believes that its modified pool insurance products risk reduction features  including a stated stop loss limit  exposure limits on each individual loan in the pool  and in some cases deductibles  reduce pmi s potential for loss exposure on loans insured by those products 
pmi s default rate for gse pool see traditional pool insurance below at december  was with  gse pool loans in default compared to a default rate of with  loans in default as of december  although gse pool loans in default declined slightly  the gse pool default rate increased due to a larger decline in the total number of loans insured 
total underwriting and operating expenses pmi s total underwriting and operating expenses are as follows percentage change vs

in millions amortization of deferred policy acquisitions costs other underwriting and operating expenses lease abandonment and relocation costs litigation settlement refund charge total underwriting and operating expenses policy acquisition costs incurred and deferred policy acquisition costs consist of direct costs related to pmi s acquisition  underwriting and processing of new insurance including contract underwriting and sales related activities 
these costs are initially deferred and amortized against related premium revenue for each policy year book of business 
policy acquisition costs incurred and deferred are variable and fluctuate with the volume of new insurance applications processed and niw and can also be reduced by increased use of pmi s electronic origination and delivery methods 
customer use of pmi s electronic delivery options accounted for approximately of pmi s insurance commitments issued in its primary flow channel in  compared to approximately in and in the decrease in policy acquisition costs incurred and deferred in compared to was primarily the result of the decline in niw in and the increase in electronic delivery in from december  to december   pmi s deferred policy acquisition cost asset decreased by million due primarily to the decline in niw compared to prior periods and the increase in electronic delivery 
continued declines in the deferred policy acquisition cost asset would reduce future amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
other underwriting and operating expenses generally consist of all other costs that are not attributable to the acquisition of new business and that are recorded as expenses when incurred 
the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses in compared to was due primarily to recognition of expenses previously deferred as acquisition costs  higher compensation and related expenses and expenses related to pmi s field operations restructuring 
the increase in compared to was due to increases in payroll and related expenses  depreciation and premium taxes 
pmi incurs underwriting expenses related to contract underwriting services for mortgage loans without mortgage insurance coverage

the mortgage insurance market and pmi s niw in were negatively impacted by the use of alternative mortgage products not requiring mortgage insurance by lenders 
the increase in primary niw in was driven by higher volumes of residential mortgage originations and refinance activities due to the historically low interest rate environment 
traditional pool insurance prior to  pmi offered certain pool insurance products to lenders and the gses  or gse pool  and to the capital markets  or old pool

the increase in persistency in was a result of the stabilization of interest rates during the increase in primary risk in force at december  compared to december  was the result of a higher percentage of policies with deeper coverage and higher persistency 
the decreases in primary insurance in force and risk in force at december  compared to december  were primarily driven by higher policy cancellations 
low mortgage interest rates in and resulted in heavy mortgage refinancing activity  which caused pmi s policy cancellations to increase and pmi s policy persistency rate to decline

the higher concentration of high ltv loans is also  to a lesser extent  the result of changes in a number of state statutes and regulations to permit the issuance of mortgage insurance on such loans  and to the expansion of underwriting guidelines by lenders  the gses and pmi as a result of market outreach efforts 
we believe that these market trends could continue in we expect higher default rates and claim payment rates for high ltv loans  arms  less than a quality loans and alt a loans and incorporate these assumptions into our pricing 
in  pmi s average premium rate increased primarily as a result of pmi s primary portfolio containing higher percentages of arms and high ltv loans 
pmi offers pre and post purchase borrower counseling to borrowers with high ltv loans in an effort to reduce the risk of default on those loans 
pmi also believes that the structure of its modified pool products mitigates the risk of loss to pmi from the less than a quality loans and alt a loans insured by those products

in addition  in accordance with the normal practice of the new york insurance department in connection with change in control applications  fgic corporation is subject to commitments to the department that it will prevent fgic from paying any dividends on its common stock for a period of two years from the date of the acquisition  or december   without the prior written consent of the department 
in addition  so long as any senior preferred stock or class b common stock issued upon conversion of that preferred stock is outstanding  fgic corporation s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits the payment of dividends or other payments on any of fgic corporation s capital stock  except the senior preferred stock  without the consent of the holder of two thirds of the outstanding shares of that preferred stock or the class b common stock issued upon conversion of that preferred stock
