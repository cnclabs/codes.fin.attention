item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial trends from fiscal year to  the net service revenue of the company declined as the company wound down the army stepo suit production contract in the national security business segment 
with increased funded contract backlog in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  the company began to reverse that trend 
multi million dollar contracts were awarded to the infrastructure and management services business segment 
these included roofing projects in san diego in support of the defense logistic agency and hurricane emergency response in various locations in florida 
the company achieved significant gross revenue growth in the first half of fiscal year as a result of increased infrastructure and management services work 
such continued growth is dependent upon winning additional follow on projects and additional new contracts in order to keep the funded contract backlog at levels that would support continued growth 
management continues to pursue many business opportunities to continue such growth  and recently  the company was awarded a million contract for construction oversight in iraq 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to grow the business base will be successful or that the company will receive sufficient contract awards to replace work as contracts are completed 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  gross revenues on the major construction projects declined compared to the first half of the fiscal year due to delays in obtaining follow on and new projects 
the resulting reduction in gross revenues along with the delay in resolution of several construction change orders negatively impacted the company s operating results for the second half of fiscal year additionally  there were delays in contract funding for the environmental protection agency and certain delays with civilian agencies also experienced delays because of the diversion of funds for the war effort  and the announcement of additional military base closings by the brac commission  which impacted funding by approximately million 
in fiscal year  the company discontinued the operations of its biological laboratory primarily due to the continued poor operating performance  market saturation and future business outlook 
such results are presented as discontinued operations for financial statement purposes and the assets and liabilities have been segregated as the company winds down the business affairs of the laboratory 
there are a number of risk factors or uncertainties that could significantly impact our financial performance including the following general economic or political conditions  threatened or pending litigation  the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives  employee hiring  utilization  and turnover rates  the seasonality of spending in the federal government and for commercial clients  delays in project contracted engagements  unanticipated contract changes impacting profitability  reductions in prices by our competitors  the ability to obtain follow on project work  failure to properly manage projects resulting in additional costs  the cost of compliance for the company s laboratories  the impact of a negative government audit potentially impacting our costs  reputation and ability to work with the federal government  loss of key personnel  the ability to compete in a highly competitive environment  and federal funding delays due to war in iraq

actual results may differ materially 
the forward looking statements include those regarding the continued award of future work or task orders from government and private clients  cost controls and reductions  the expected resolution of delays in billing of certain projects  and the possible impact of current and future claims against the company based upon negligence and other theories of liability

net service revenue is derived by deducting the costs of purchased services from gross revenue 
versar considers it appropriate to analyze operating margins and other ratios in relation to net service revenue  because such revenues reflect the actual work performed by the company s labor force 
net service revenue increased by in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in direct project labor  which generated higher margins as compared to fiscal year net service revenues decreased by in fiscal year due to a decrease in revenue generated from the company s work force compared to fiscal year direct costs of service and overhead include the cost to versar of direct and overhead staff  including recoverable and unallowable costs that are directly attributable to contracts 
the percentage of these costs to net service revenue increased slightly to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in the percentage in fiscal year is due to lower profit margins in the company s infrastructure and management services business segment in which the company recorded lower revenue due to schedule slippage and a contract dispute that has not been resolved as of the end of the fiscal year

in fiscal year  the company increased the tax valuation allowance by  the increase was due to the reduced operating performance in fiscal year the company has approximately million in deferred tax assets of which a million valuation allowance has been established against such assets 
management provides for a valuation allowance until such time as it can conclude more likely than not that the company will derive a benefit from such assets 
the valuation allowance is adjusted as necessary based upon the company s ability to generate taxable income  including management s ability to implement tax strategies that will enable the company to benefit from such deferred tax assets

a summary of revenue generated from the company s client base is as follows for the years ended july  june  june  in thousands  except for percentages government epa state local department of defense other commercial gross revenue the increase in department of defense and other government revenues were primarily due to the large construction projects performed during fiscal year such increases were in part offset by the winding down of a large commercial mold remediation project during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital as of july  approximated  an increase of  
in addition  the company s current ratio at july  was  which was slightly lower than that reported on june  due to the increase in receivables and prepaids and the utilization of the line of credit during the year 
in september  versar entered into a new line of credit facility with united bank the bank that provides for advances up to  based upon qualifying receivables 
interest on the borrowings is based on prime plus one and a half percent as of july  
as of july   versar had outstanding borrowing of  and additional availability of  under the line of credit 
obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by the company and each subsidiary individually and are collectively secured by accounts receivable  equipment and intangibles  plus all insurance policies on property constituting collateral 
the credit facility is scheduled for renewal in november  and is subject to certain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios 
these covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of  a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and a minimum current ratio of at least to failure to meet the covenant requirements gives the bank the right to demand the amount due under the line of credit  which may impact the company s ability to finance its working capital requirements 
at july   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants 
we believe that our borrowing capacity and the renewal of the line of credit  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  is sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for the next year 
there can be no assurance  however  that amounts available in the future from existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity requirements at july   the company had unfunded contractual payment obligations of approximately  due within the next twelve months 
the table below specifies the total contractual payment obligations as of july  contractual total less than after obligations cost year years years years in thousands operating leases capital lease notes payable total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on versar s consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding the company s consolidated  financial position  and results of operations which require management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or net estimated realizable value of costs  reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
the company records income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may effect the revenue recognition on a project 
losses on contracts are recognized in the period when they become known 
from time to time we may proceed with work based on customer direction pending finalizing and signing of contract funding documents 
we have an internal process for approving any such work 
the company recognizes revenue based on actual costs incurred to the extent that the funding is assessed as probable 
in evaluating the probability of funding being received  we consider our previous experience with the customer  communications with the customer regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  costs are expensed as they are incurred 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
it is most likely that such adjustments could occur with our larger fixed priced projects 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
adjustments to the financial statement are made when they are known 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of the company s business on projects where the company is contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability or collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs pincurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
claims against the company are recognized where loss is considered probable and reasonably determinable in amount 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a regular basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company has approximately million in deferred tax assets of which a million valuation allowance has been established against such assets 
management provides for a valuation allowance until such time as it can conclude more likely than not that the company will derive a benefit from such assets 
the valuation allowance is adjusted as necessary based upon the company s ability to generate taxable income  including management s ability to implement tax strategies that will enable the company to benefit from such deferred tax assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   versar completed the acquisition of the greenwood partnership  pc subsequently renamed versar global solutions  inc or vgsi 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
goodwill resulting from this transaction was approximately million 
in fiscal year  the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which eliminated the amortization of goodwill  but requires the company to test such goodwill for impairment annually 
currently  the carrying value of goodwill is approximately  relating to the acquisition of vgsi  which is now part of the infrastructure and management services ims reporting unit 
the ims business segment was combined with the engineering and construction business segment during fiscal year because many of the services provided were similar to the company s remediation business  shared similar customers  business opportunities  and was duplicative in nature 
such a combination provided a more efficient use of resources and more effective management of the business operations 
in performing its goodwill impairment analysis  management has utilized a market based valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the ims reporting unit 
management engages outside professionals and valuation experts  as necessary  to assist in performing this analysis 
an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of the ims reporting unit was m which is in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill on the books 
should the ims reporting unit financial performance not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether the write down to the asset would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact the company s cash flow or financial debt covenants 
during fiscal years and  management concluded  based upon its impairment analysis  that goodwill relating to the infrastructure and management services reporting unit was not impaired 
on april   the company acquired the cultural resources group from parsons infrastructure technology group  inc  a subsidiary of parsons corporation for a purchase price of approximately  in cash
