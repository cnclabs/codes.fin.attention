overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in both niche and larger market segments 
we distribute our products on a worldwide basis 
in the united states  we distribute our products through wholesalers and we market our products to physicians through a sales force that includes both our own employees and representatives of a contract sales organization 
in the united kingdom  we distribute our oral liquid pharmaceutical products directly to hospitals and through wholesalers to retail customers  and we market our products primarily to physicians through our own sales force 
in israel  we distribute our products directly to hospitals  hmos and retailers  and we market our products to physicians through our own sales force 
elsewhere in the world  we distribute our products primarily through third party license and distribution relationships 
through a combination of internal research and development  acquisitions  collaborative relationships and licensing arrangements  we have assembled a portfolio of therapeutic products and product candidates  many of which are currently being marketed and several of which are in registration or clinical development 
in july  we announced a change in our strategic business plan to reposition our company to focus on the full development of our pipeline products 
this will include an enhanced focus on the clinical development of puricase  our product candidate currently in phase clinical trials  and prosaptide  our product candidate for which we may explore indications for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain or the potential to treat peripheral neuropathic pain in the hiv or other disease populations 
we also plan to engage in an active in licensing program to access and develop novel compounds in late stage clinical trials as well as marketed products complementary to this strategy 
we were founded in as bio technology general corp 
to develop  manufacture and market novel therapeutic products 
in september  we acquired rosemont pharmaceuticals limited  a specialty pharmaceutical company located in the united kingdom 
rosemont develops  manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products in oral liquid form 
we coordinate our overall administration  finance  business development  human clinical trials  us sales and marketing activities  quality assurance and regulatory affairs primarily from our headquarters in east brunswick  new jersey 
we carry out the development  manufacture  distribution and sale of our oral liquid pharmaceutical products through rosemont in the united kingdom 
development and manufacturing activities for our global biologics manufacturing business are primarily carried out in israel through our bio technology general israel ltd 
subsidiary 
on march   we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to divest our global biologics manufacturing business to ferring 
our financial results have been heavily dependent on oxandrin since we introduced it in december sales of oxandrin accounted for of our net product sales in  of our net product sales in 
back to contents and of our net product sales in oxandrin net sales in were reduced by  as a result of product returns and a provision for future product returns that we recorded during oxandrin sales in were adversely affected by our change to selling directly to wholesalers rather than through a third party distributor 
several companies have filed drug master files with the fda relating to a generic drug with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as oxandrin 
while we cannot predict when generic competition for oxandrin will begin  the fda may approve one or more generic versions of oxandrin at any time 
the introduction of these generic products would likely cause a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which would adversely affect us financially and could require us to scale back some of our business activities 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a less significant product for our future operating results 
sales of delatestryl have decreased significantly as a result of the fda s allowance of the reintroduction of a generic version of delatestryl into the market in march  and could continue to decrease further in the future 
sales of our human growth hormone declined in because of lower sales to our japanese distributor 
we expect that sales of our human growth hormone product will increase in the coming years as a result of teva s recent introduction of our human growth hormone in the united states under the brand name tev tropin 
rosemont s product sales represented a larger percentage of our overall product sales in rosemont s product sales accounted for of our product sales in and of our product sales in given the historical growth of rosemont product sales in combination with the potential introduction of generic oxandrolone and the divestiture of our global biologics manufacturing business  we expect rosemont to account for an even higher percentage of our overall product sales in the coming years 
we began to depreciate our new manufacturing facility and certain equipment in be er tuvia  israel in january as a result  total depreciation expense for our israeli based global biologics manufacturing business increased from  in to  in on march   we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to divest our global biologics manufacturing business to ferring 
as a result of the execution of this definitive agreement  we will reclassify our global biologics manufacturing business as discontinued operations 
because this reclassification took effect after december   our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended december  do not reflect this reclassification 
new strategic direction based upon our new strategic business plan to reposition our company to focus on the full development of our pipeline products and upon the current business outlook  the likelihood of our being able to fully realize our deferred income tax benefits against future income became uncertain 
accordingly  in the second quarter of we recorded a  valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and a corresponding provision for income taxes  and in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional  valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

back to contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition 
product sales are recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale  and when collectability is probable  net of discounts  sales incentives  sales allowances and sales returns 
under the terms of sale that we offer to our customers  title may transfer upon delivery to the customer  upon delivery to the customer s shipper or carrier or upon shipment 
contract fees  which consist mainly of license of marketing and distribution rights and research and development projects  are recognized over the estimated term of the related agreements 
revenues related to performance milestones are recognized upon the achievement of the milestone  as defined in the respective agreements  and when collectability is probable 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are included in deferred revenue 
royalties are recognized once an agreement exists  the sale is made and the royalty is earned 
other revenues represent funds received by us for research and development projects that are partially funded by the chief scientist of the state of israel 
we recognize revenue upon performance of such funded research 
if we are successful in closing the divestiture of our global biologics manufacturing business in israel  future funding from the office of the chief scientist would not be available to us 
allowances for returns 
through december   sales returns had been minimal and insignificant to our results of operations 
however  beginning in the first quarter of and continuing through the second quarter  we became aware that retail customers of our wholesalers were preparing to return expired product  primarily mg oxandrin and mg oxandrin  which had reached the end of its shelf life 
historically  we had experienced virtually no returns of the mg oxandrin tablet because of the product s five year shelf life 
the mg oxandrin tablet  which was introduced in the second half of  currently has a two year shelf life 
on the basis of the actual returns received primarily in the second and third quarters of  we estimated the total cost of future product returns 
in the first nine months of  we issued credits to our wholesalers totaling  in the fourth quarter of  we issued additional credits to our wholesalers totaling  the aggregate provision for product returns that we recorded in was  as of december   our reserve for future returns  which may occur over several years  was  we will continue to monitor our product returns 
we regularly review the factors that influence our estimates including actual returns experience  the demand for our products  estimated inventory levels of our wholesaler customers  and other relevant factors 
if necessary  we make adjustments when we believe that actual product returns may differ from established reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances and the demand for our products could result in material changes in the amount of returned product  and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventory obsolescence 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost using the weighted average method 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
the reserves as of december  were  as compared to  as of december  in addition  loss contract reserves of  included in other liabilities  were established in for the resolution of other purchase commitments that may be in excess of expected demand 
our inventories include oxandrin inventories that we believe would potentially be in excess of expected product demand if the fda approves a generic form of the product in the near term 
the amount of such potential excess will vary depending upon the timing of the approval of a generic product  the number of generic products that are approved and the rate by which generic sales reduce demand for branded oxandrin 

back to contents if generic approval occurs during the second quarter of  we estimate that such potential excess may be up to  intangible assets acquired 
on september   we acquired rosemont 
we allocated the aggregate purchase price of  based on the estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired  which was based on an independent appraisal and information available at the time of the acquisition 
the intangible assets acquired consist of developed products  trademarks and several patents and are being amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful life of approximately years 
goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of rosemont  we recorded  of goodwill 
under the accounting rules for goodwill  this intangible asset is not amortized 
instead  we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of rosemont with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of rosemont 
if the estimated fair value of rosemont is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year 
if  however  the estimated fair value of rosemont is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of rosemont 
the various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for rosemont s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for rosemont  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of rosemont 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
we have adopted a policy to review rosemont for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward looking information regarding market share  revenues and costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result  changes in these assumptions and current working capital could materially change the outcome of rosemont s fair value determinations in future periods  which could require a permanent write down of goodwill 
investments 
from time to time  we invest in nonmarketable equity securities for strategic purposes 
these investments are carried at cost 
we periodically monitor the liquidity  progress and financing activities of these entities to determine if impairment write downs are required 
in  we wrote down our investment in marco hi tech jv  ltd 
by  and our investment in omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc by  income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of capital loss  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
based upon our current business outlook and the change in our strategic direction  the likelihood of our being able to fully realize our deferred income tax benefits against future income became uncertain 
accordingly  as of december   we have a  valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
accounts receivable 
we extend credit to customers based on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
we generally do not require collateral from our customers when we extend credit 
accounts receivable are usually due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to us and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to recovery of accounts written off 

back to contents litigation 
we are currently involved in the legal proceedings referred to in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
if any of these matters is resolved in a manner unfavorable to us  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically assess impairments of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the factors that we consider include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above impairment indicators  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of these expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is equal to the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
capitalization and depreciation of cost of new production facility 
we have constructed a new manufacturing facility in israel 
all costs associated with design  construction and qualification activities  including labor  outside contractors and consultants  materials  utilities  other indirect costs and interest costs on funds borrowed to fund construction  have been capitalized 
costs associated with process validation  which involves the transfer of product manufacturing processes to the new facility and verification that product manufacture is reproducible  are being expensed 
we determined that qualification was substantially completed as of september  and that no further costs would be capitalized 
we began to depreciate our new manufacturing facility and certain equipment in be er tuvia  israel in january we estimate that depreciation expense will be approximately  annually once all equipment at the be er tuvia facility is placed in service 
as a result  depreciation will increase in as compared to  resulting in an increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales 
if  however  we are successful in closing the divestiture our global biologics manufacturing business  we will no longer incur these higher costs 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see consolidated financial statements included in this report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

if we are successful in divesting our israeli business operations  future funding from the office of the chief scientist would not be available to us 
our revenues and expenses have in the past displayed  and may in the future continue to display  significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing and amount of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  including generic products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from licensees

in  net cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income mainly due to a decrease in accounts receivable of  an increase in other current liabilities of  and deferred income tax of  and depreciation and amortization of  and amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisition of  net cash in was reduced by an increase in inventories of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable of  and  respectively  and deferred revenue of in  net cash provided by operating activities was less than net income primarily as a result of an increased accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred income taxes  and deferred revenues of  net cash in was increased by increased accounts payable in the amount of  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions and a provision for inventory reduction in connection with the validation of a new manufacturing site in the united states

loans under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus 
the credit facility is secured by the assets of btg israel and is guaranteed by us 
as of december  we had long term borrowings of  compared to  at december  as of december   the loans are at an average interest rate of approximately 
in june  rosemont commenced an upgrade of its manufacturing facility to obtain fda approval to enable rosemont to manufacture oral liquid products for supply into the us market 
the project was substantially completed in at a total cost of approximately million 
we believe that our cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales and anticipated proceeds from the divestiture of our global biologics manufacturing business  will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may fail to achieve our anticipated liquidity levels as a result of unexpected events or failure to achieve our goals 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following our ability to successfully close the divestiture of our global biologics manufacturing business  the timing and amount of product sales  particularly our continued ability to sell oxandrin prior to the introduction of generic versions of the product  continued progress in our research and development programs  particularly with respect to prosaptide and puricase  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  including regulatory approvals for prosaptide  puricase  and any other product candidates that we may seek to develop in the future and regulatory approval to enable rosemont to manufacture oral liquid pharmaceutical products for supply into the us market  the timing and magnitude of any future milestone payment obligations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the quality and timeliness of the performance of our third party suppliers and distributors  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the outcome of pending purported class action and other related  or potentially related  actions and the litigation costs with respect to such actions  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements 

back to contents if we are required to seek additional funding for our operations  we might not be able to obtain such additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding might be on unacceptable terms 
we continue to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered 
however  we may not be able to enter into any such agreements 
below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than one year years years after years undetermined long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet total includes interest expense of  in consists primarily of purchase commitments of  for oxandrolone  the active ingredient in oxandrin  and  for delatestryl in  and beyond

because these benefits are paid only upon termination of employment  it is not possible to allocate the liability across future years 
if we are successful in closing the divestiture of our global biologics manufacturing business  these obligations will become due immediately 
these amounts do not include contingent royalty obligations to the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

 consolidated financial statements  as amended by fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  which requires the preparation of consolidated financial statements when one entity has a controlling financial interest in a second entity 
usually a controlling financial interest is created when an investor owns a majority of the voting interests in an investee 
however  in some circumstances  an entity is created solely to fulfill a specific purpose and voting interests do not provide a substantive indicator of a controlling financial interest because there are typically limited matters on which investors may vote 
fin refers to those entities as variable interest entities vies and creates a model for consolidation based on an investor s ownership of variable interests 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for interests acquired in vies after january   and at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  for interests acquired in vies before february  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

back to contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
to date our exposure to market risk has been limited 
we do not currently hedge any market risk  although we may do so in the future 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk borrowings under our  credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and therefore  we are impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates 
our annual interest payable on the  outstanding under this facility as of december  would change by approximately  in for each basis point increase or decrease 
because these borrowings relate to the construction of our new facility  interest expense was capitalized until august  see note g of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our interest bearing assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  which currently consist of money market funds  commercial paper and other liquid short term debt instruments  and short term investments  which currently consist primarily of investments in mutual funds  corporate bonds and short term certificates of deposit 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates and other market conditions 
foreign currency risk as a result of our operations in israel and the united kingdom  we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can affect our results of operations 
our results of operations in benefited from the decrease in value of the us dollar against the british pound sterling 
we manage our israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars as a result of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on our non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of our operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset  or is offset on a delayed basis  by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the us dollar 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg israel s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency benefit our results of operations 
however  should btg israel s revenues in shekels exceed our expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel would adversely affect our results of operations 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  our results of operations would be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars would increase
