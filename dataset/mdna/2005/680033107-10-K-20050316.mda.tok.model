item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary net income for decreased compared to previous years  impacted primarily by nonrecurring charges related to ascend  decreased net securities gains and reduced mortgage banking revenue 
weak loan demand in the markets served by old national as well as low interest rates continue to negatively affect the net interest margin 
positive factors during included reduced provisions for loan losses  increased insurance premiums and commissions  and increased service charge income 
in addition  included a million reserve for the settlement of pending litigation 
old national s financial condition at december   reflected significant reductions in loans  time deposits and borrowed funds 
the reduction in loans was primarily the result of two loan sales occurring during the year as well as soft loan demand 
management uses various indicators such as return on assets  return on equity and asset quality ratios to evaluate the performance of the business 
these are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial basis the following discussion is an analysis of old national s results of operations for the years ended december  through  and financial condition as of december  and this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with old national s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements concerning old national s business that are based on estimates and involves certain risks and uncertainties 
therefore  future results could differ significantly from management s current expectations and the related forward looking statements 
see item  business for further information regarding forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in the annual report  are based upon old national s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires old national to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights and the valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance in the near future 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
old national s policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
old national monitors the quality of its loan portfolio on an on going basis and uses a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining its allowance for loan losses 
old national records provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for the company s highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect old national s borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
old national has a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews conducted at the community bank locations as well as regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
old national uses migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for non retail loans that are not impaired 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
old national calculates migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans 
management s analysis of probable losses inherent in the portfolio at december   resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million with the potential effect to net income ranging from a decrease of million to an increase of million 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
the total price of loans sold is allocated between the loans sold and the mortgage servicing rights retained based on the relative fair values of each 
the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights is estimated by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing income derived from related cash flows 
amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
impairment of mortgage servicing rights exists if the book value of the mortgage servicing rights exceeds its estimated fair value 
in determining impairment  mortgage servicing rights are stratified by interest rates 
critical assumptions used in determining fair value include expected mortgage loan prepayment rates  discount rates and other economic factors  which are determined based on current market conditions 
the expected rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the value of mortgage servicing rights 
increases in expected mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced 
fair values are derived by using a statistical modeling technique utilizing third party market based prepayment rate assumptions 
negative adjustments to the value  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges against mortgage servicing income 
the use of a valuation allowance enables the recovery of this value as market conditions become more favorable 
the decrease in fair value of mortgage servicing rights at december   to immediate and adverse changes in the current prepayment assumptions would be approximately million and million  respectively 
a and adverse change in the discount rate assumption would decrease the fair value of mortgage servicing rights at december   by million and million  respectively 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
also  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in other factors  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
goodwill and intangibles 
for acquisitions  old national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives for which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible with subsequent reversal of the impairment loss being prohibited 
the determination of fair values is based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
changes in these factors  as well as downturns in economic or business conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangibles and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 
management believes the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization and valuation of mortgage servicing rights  and the valuation of goodwill and intangibles are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require company management to make assumptions concerning  among other factors  the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  valuation assumptions and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on old national s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as net income 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis 
non gaap financial measures in january  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
this management s discussion and analysis may contain non gaap financial measures 
for purposes of regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of the registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows or equivalent statements of the issuer  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
in this regard  gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation g  old national has provided reconciliations  as necessary  of the non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure

noninterest expense increased as a result of the nonrecurring pre tax charges related to ascend of million  or million after tax  as well as increased severance benefits related to reorganization of management and increased occupancy expense due to the new evansville main financial center and corporate headquarters 
also  in a charge of million pre tax  or million after tax was recorded to establish a reserve related to litigation settlements 
the details of these expenses are discussed further in the noninterest expense section of this management s discussion and analysis 
also  see additional information on ascend and details regarding the new evansville main financial center and corporate headquarters below 
the most significant positive impact on december  earnings was the decrease in the provision for loan losses of million  largely a result of the reduction of nonperforming loans and charge offs and reflective of enhanced credit administration and underwriting functions during the company wide program  ascend  was announced in late the initial phase of the project was conducted with the assistance of ehs partners and was an intense evaluation of every aspect of operations for expense reductions and revenue growth ideas 
at december   ascend was in the implementation phase 
ideas representing approximately million of the targeted earnings were complete  million were on time  million were late  million were at risk of completion  million were withdrawn and an additional million of new ideas had been identified 
initiatives arising from the project are expected to be fully implemented by the end of  with full realization of benefits by in  the board of directors approved construction of a new evansville main financial center and corporate headquarters to be completed prior to expiration of the operating leases on the buildings then occupied 
prior to this decision  the board of directors evaluated renewal options for the leases on the then occupied buildings including capital investments that would be required for improvements to the leased facilities 
it was determined that the costs associated with continuing the leases and making the required capital investments would be relatively comparable to constructing a new building 
the new evansville main financial center and corporate headquarters was placed into service on august  at december   the total project cost was million including building components of million  furniture  fixtures and equipment of million  land of million and capitalized interest of million 
business line results old national is managed in three primary business segments 
table summarizes old national s business line results for the years ended december business line results table dollars in thousands community banking    non bank services    treasury    other   consolidated net income    the community banking segment profit increased million from the most significant impact on the community banking segment profit was the decrease of million in the provision for loan losses  which is reflective of enhanced credit administration and underwriting functions during  as well as a decline in the loan portfolio 
this decline in the provision was offset by decreased noninterest income of million  decreased net interest income of million and increased noninterest expense of million 
noninterest income was affected primarily by the decline in mortgage banking activity during the current year 
the decline in net interest income was reflective of a decrease in average earning assets as well as an increase in the cost of funding 
the most significant contributors to the increase in noninterest expense in were the nonrecurring charges related to ascend  severance benefits related to reorganization of management and professional fees related to compliance with banking regulations and the first year implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the non bank services segment profit decreased million from which is reflective of an increase in noninterest income of million that was offset by an increase in noninterest expense of million 
the growth in noninterest income was primarily due to the insurance acquisitions made during the increase in noninterest expense can be partially attributed to these acquisitions and partially to the allocation of the ascend charges 
the treasury segment profit showed a decline of million in as compared to  primarily as a result of the net securities gains decrease of million in compared to the other segment profit included gains or charges which management chose not to allocate to the various segments 
other for included expenses to record the litigation reserve of million  or million after tax 
net interest income net interest income was the most significant component of old national s earnings  comprising over of revenues 
net interest income and net interest margin in the following discussion is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which adjusts tax exempt interest income to an amount that would be comparable to interest subject to income taxes 
net income is unaffected by these taxable equivalent adjustments as an offsetting increase of the same amount is made in the income tax section 
net interest income included taxable equivalent adjustments of million for and million for net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources and interest rate fluctuations 
other factors include accelerated prepayments of mortgage related assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities 
funding from client deposits generally cost less than wholesale funding sources 
factors  such as general economic activity  federal reserve board monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments  can also exert significant influence on old national s ability to optimize its mix of assets and funding and its net interest income and margin 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million in  a decrease from the million reported in the net interest margin was for  compared to reported for the reduction in net interest income was a result of the increase in the cost of funding without offsetting increases in earning asset yields 
average earning assets declined by million  which consisted of decreased investment securities of million and decreased loans of million  net of increased money market investments of million 
the yield on average earning assets declined basis points from to 
average interest bearing liabilities declined by million or  which included decreased borrowings of million and decreased interest bearing deposits of million 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined basis points from to 
noninterest bearing deposits provided million in funding 
the continued decline in interest rates during and early had a notable effect on the volume  mix and yield of average earning assets 
the target federal funds rate  the rate that dictates national prime rate and determines many other short term loan and liability rates  began to rise in june from to by december market driven interest rates  as evidenced by the five year united states treasury note weekly yield  increased slowly but not significantly during from in january to in december 
significantly affecting average earning assets during was the sale of million of residential real estate loans at the end of the second quarter of in addition  commercial and commercial real estate loans continued to decline during as a result of continued weak loan demand in old national s markets  more stringent loan underwriting standards  and the sale of million in nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans during the fourth quarter of during  the company continued its strategy to reduce its investment portfolio assets because of the narrow spreads available on those assets in the current rate environment 
however  at the end of  the investment portfolio increased slightly as a short term investment of funds from the fourth quarter loan sale

noninterest income old national generates revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees and sales commissions from its core banking franchise and other related businesses  such as wealth management  investment consulting  investment products and insurance 
this source of revenue has remained steady as a percentage of total revenue at in compared to in noninterest income for was million  a decrease of million  or compared to million reported for  impacted most significantly by a million reduction of net securities gains and a million decrease in mortgage revenue 
in  old national realized million of gains on the sales of investment securities in comparison to million for investment securities transactions are considered part of the continuing management of the balance sheet to address interest rate and yield curve shifts 
the decrease in mortgage banking revenue was primarily attributable to the reduction in mortgage origination activity during residential real estate loan originations for were billion compared to the record level of billion for  with high levels of refinancing activity during being driven by unusually low interest rates

most of the growth occurred in insurance premiums and commissions which increased by million or  reflective of a full year s results for the insurance agencies acquired during also deposit related fees and service charges were million in  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the generation of increased revenue was primarily attributable to processing changes and ideas developed through the ascend process

this increase is primarily attributable to severance and related benefits expense of million recorded during  including expenses related to several members of management and senior executives leaving the company during the year as well as terminations related to ascend reflected in the table above 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense is also reflective of a full year s operations for three insurance agencies acquired during professional fees totaled million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
as indicated above  consulting fees paid to ehs partners during in connection with ascend accounted for million of the increase 
other increases related primarily to fees paid in connection with strengthening compliance with banking regulations and first year implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
other losses totaled million  a decrease of million compared to million for this decrease was primarily attributable to the million charge in to establish a reserve in connection with litigation 
for additional information on litigation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining components of noninterest expense totaled million for compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy expense partially related to the new evansville main financial center and corporate headquarters  the provision for unfunded commitments and increased processing expense offset partly by decreases in several other noninterest expense accounts 
old national completed construction of its principal executive offices in it is estimated that the net increase to occupancy  equipment and other noninterest expense components will have an annualized decrease to net income per share of

financial condition overview old national s assets at december   were billion  a decrease compared to billion recorded at december  investments increased million  loans decreased million and total liabilities declined million compared to december  total shareholders equity decreased million since december  earning assets old national s earning assets are comprised of loans and loans held for sale  investment securities and money market investments 
earning assets were billion at december   a decrease of from billion at december  the reduction in earning assets is due to a decline in the loan portfolio 
at december   total loans  including residential loans held for sale  decreased million compared to december  this decline can be attributed primarily to sales of million in commercial  commercial real estate and residential real estate loans during the year as well as to continued weakness in commercial lending 
investment securities increased at december   as a temporary source of earning assets  however  during old national reduced its average investment portfolio in light of fewer attractive investment opportunities and the company s desire to reduce its sensitivity to rising interest rates 
investment securities old national classifies investment securities primarily as available for sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed  based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in the company s funding requirements 
however  old national added and year fixed rate mortgage pass through securities to its held to maturity investment portfolio during emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  may potentially affect the treatment of investments in an unrealized loss position 
until final guidance is issued by the fasb  it is uncertain whether this eitf issue will have a material impact on old national 
at december   old national does not believe any individual unrealized loss on available for sale securities represents other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates 
old national has both the intent and ability to hold the securities for a time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
at december   the investment securities portfolio was billion compared to billion at december   an increase of 
investment securities represented of earning assets at december   compared to at december  during the first half of  old national increased the investment portfolio as a short term alternative source of earning assets to offset declining residential real estate and minimal commercial and consumer loan growth 
during the second half of and continuing into  old national decreased the size of the investment portfolio and used the cash flows generated by the declining investment portfolio to reduce borrowed funds 
at the end of  investments increased slightly as a short term investment of funds from the fourth quarter loan sale 
stronger economic activity and stronger commercial loan demand would likely result in increased investments in loans and a reduction in the investment securities portfolio 
investment securities available for sale portfolio had net unrealized gains of million at december   compared to million at december  these unrealized gains are driven by interest rate conditions 
the decrease was a result of higher market interest rates at december   compared to december  also  old national realized pre tax net gains on sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio of million during and million during as a result of a planned reduction  the investment portfolio had an effective duration of years at december   compared to years at december  the weighted average yields on available for sale investment securities were in and in the average yields on the held to maturity portfolio were in and in at december   old national had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values million by indiana  which represented of shareholders equity  and million by illinois  which represented of shareholders equity 
at december   the aggregate market values of the concentration of certain states and their political subdivisions were million by indiana  which represented of shareholders equity  and million by illinois  which represented of shareholders equity 
there were no other concentrations of investment securities issued by an individual state and its political subdivisions that were greater than of shareholders equity 
residential loans held for sale residential loans held for sale were million at december   compared to million at december  residential loans held for sale are loans that are closed  but not yet sold on the secondary market 
the amount of residential loans held for sale on the balance sheet varies depending on the timing of movement of originations and loan sales to the secondary market 
during  loan originations were down compared to  primarily due to a reduced level of loan refinancing resulting from an upturn in interest rates above the record low rates of lending and loan administration in  due to continued credit quality concerns  old national implemented certain credit approval disciplines in order to continue to focus on the reduction of problem and non performing loans in the portfolio  including a restructuring of the manner in which commercial loans are analyzed and approved 
community based credit personnel  which now include independent underwriting and analytic support staff  extend credit under guidelines established and administered by old national s credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  includes members from both the holding company and the bank  as well as outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  problem loans and charge offs and regularly reviews the loan policy to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
old national lends primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
as measured by old national at december   the company had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of its portfolio and has no exposure to foreign borrowers or lesser developed countries 
old national s policy is to concentrate its lending activity in the geographic market areas it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and tennessee 
old national has been affected by weakness in the economy of its principal markets  particularly in its home state of indiana  which has resulted in a decline of commercial loans and tighter credit underwriting standards 
old national anticipates that when the economy in old national s principal markets shows increased improvement  commercial loans will begin to show higher levels of growth 
in the past four years  commercial  commercial real estate and residential real estate loans declined  and per year  respectively while consumer loans rose annually over the same period

a write down of million was recorded against the allowance for loan losses related to these sales 
weak loan demand in old national s markets continued to affect commercial loan growth in consumer loans  including automobile loans  personal and home equity loans and lines of credit  and student loans  increased million or at december   compared to december   primarily the result of enhancements to marketing and customer contact programs

old national sells the majority of residential real estate loans originated as a strategy to better manage interest rate risk and liquidity 
these loans are generally sold with loan servicing retained in order to maintain client relationships and generate noninterest income and fees 
by using this strategy  old national is able to recognize an immediate gain in noninterest income versus a small net interest income spread over a longer period of time 
old national sells the majority of the residential real estate loans without recourse  currently having less than of loans sold with recourse 
residential real estate loans were million at december   a decrease of million or from december  the sale of million of residential real estate loans during the year was the most significant contributor to this decrease 
at december   old national was in the process of making a strategic shift from the mortgage operations being managed as a line of business with free standing offices to being an integral part of the focus on expanding customer relationships 
allowance for loan losses and asset quality administration old national monitors the quality of its loan portfolio on an on going basis and uses a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining its allowance for loan losses 
old national records provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for the company s highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect old national s borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
old national has a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews conducted at the community bank locations as well as regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
each month  problem loan reports are prepared and reviewed  which include borrowers that show indications of being unable to meet debt obligations in the normal course of business  and loans which have other characteristics deemed by bank management to warrant special attention or have been criticized by regulators in the examination process 
classified loans include non performing loans  past due days or more and other loans deemed to have well defined weaknesses while criticized loans  also known as special mention loans  are loans that are deemed to have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and also require specific monthly reviews by the bank 
assets determined by the various evaluation processes to be under performing receive special attention by old national management 
under performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans where the ultimate collectibility of interest or principal is uncertain  loans renegotiated in some manner  primarily to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments because the borrower s financial condition deteriorated  loans with principal or interest past due ninety days or more  and foreclosed properties 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest become days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  interest accrued during the current year is reversed against earnings  interest accrued in the prior year  if any  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
cash received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual is recorded to principal 
adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are made as deemed necessary for probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
while an estimate of probable losses is  by its very nature  difficult to precisely predict  management of old national believes that the methodology that it uses in determining an appropriate reserve for expected losses is reasonable 
loan officers and credit underwriters jointly grade the larger commercial and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio periodically as determined by loan policy requirements or determined by specific guidelines based on loan characteristics as set by management and banking regulation 
periodically  these loan grades are reviewed independently by the loan review department 
for impaired loans  an assessment is conducted as to whether there is likely loss in the event of default 
if such a loss is determined to be likely  the loss is quantified and a specific reserve is assigned to the loan 
for the balance of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  loan grade migration analysis coupled with historic loss experience within the respective grades is used to develop reserve requirement ranges based on expected losses 
a loan is considered impaired under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of fasb statement no 
and when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
an impaired loan does not include larger groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value  leases and debt securities 
old national uses migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for non retail loans that are not impaired 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
old national calculates migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans 
allowance for loan losses and asset quality at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  a decrease of million compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans  including loans held for sale  the allowance increased to at december   from at december  during  the provision for loan losses amounted to million  a decrease of million compared to reductions in nonperforming loans and charge offs were significant factors in the decrease of the allowance for loan losses during other factors included the sales of million of residential real estate loans and million of nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans  changes to separate the loan production functions from the underwriting functions  significant strengthening of the commercial underwriting processes and the elevation of the credit policy committee to a board level committee to improve credit quality 
in comparison  the amount necessary to cover the higher than normal losses in was significant  collateral values in the markets served by old national deteriorated which led to the need for higher reserves in the event of liquidation and loss experience elevated the rate of expected future losses 
in keeping with evolving industry practice and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the amount of the allowance for loan losses attributable to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments was reclassified into a liability account on the balance sheet during for consistency in presentation  the allowance for unfunded loan commitments has been reclassified for the year ended december   as well 
the balance of the allowance for unfunded loan commitments was insignificant for reclassification for years ended prior to december  for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the reserve decreased by million at december   compared to december  the reserve as a percentage of that portfolio decreased to at december   from at december   which is reflective of the sale of million of nonaccrual loans of this type during the fourth quarter of the absolute level of classified and criticized loans at december   decreased from december  the reserve for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio increased to at december   from at december  this increase reflected an increase in historical loss rates due to higher residential real estate loan charge offs during  including the losses resulting from the sale of residential real estate loans 
the reserve for consumer loans increased to at december   from at december  this was reflective of the acknowledgement of the relatively higher growth rate in the consumer portfolio as well as a change in the inherent loss estimate used for these types of loans

management believes that it has appropriately identified and reserved for loan losses related to nonaccrual loans at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
approximately million of nonaccrual loans less than thirty days delinquent were still contractually performing at december  management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non performing loans and will consider the possibility of additional sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional write downs to the allowance for loan losses 
interest income of approximately million and million would have been recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans outstanding at december  and  respectively if such loans had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms 
the amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans was million in and million in old national had no renegotiated loans at december  and the total portfolio of loans identified by old national as problem credits continues to decline 
under performing assets totaled million at december  and million at december  as a percent of total loans and foreclosed properties  under performing assets at december were for and for the nonaccrual category of under performing loans was million at december   a decrease of million since december   which is reflective of both the sale of million in nonaccrual loans and the enhanced credit administration and underwriting functions during at december   the allowance for loan losses to under performing assets ratio stood at compared to at december  classified loans were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  of this total  other problem loans  which are loans reviewed for the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  criticized loans  or special mention loans  were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  management believes it has taken a prudent approach to the evaluation of under performing  criticized and classified loans  and the loan portfolio in general both in acknowledging the portfolio s general condition and in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
old national has been affected by weakness in the economy of its markets  which has resulted in minimal growth of commercial loans and tighter credit underwriting standards 
management expects that trends in under performing  criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens 
old national operates in the midwest  primarily in the state of indiana  which has been particularly negatively affected by the weakness in the manufacturing segment of the economy 
the longer the significant softness in manufacturing continues the more stress it puts on old national s borrowers  increasing the potential for additional nonaccrual loans

the reduction in time accounts was also due to the maturity of a group of higher interest rate certificates of deposit during old national uses wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain its desired interest rate risk position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management inherent in old national s balance sheet is market risk  defined as the sensitivity of income  fair market values and capital to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
the primary market risk to which old national has exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises because assets and liabilities may reprice  mature or prepay at different times or based upon different market instruments as market interest rates change 
changes in the slope of the yield curve and the pace of interest rate changes may also impact net interest income and the fair value of the balance sheet 
old national manages interest rate risk within an overall asset and liability management framework that includes attention to credit risk  liquidity risk and capitalization 
a principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
asset and liability management activity is governed by a policy reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors has delegated the administration of this policy to the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  and the balance sheet management committee  a committee comprised of senior company management 
the funds management committee meets quarterly and oversees adherence to policy and recommends policy changes to the board 
the balance sheet management committee meets monthly and provides guidance to treasury and other operating units of the company regarding the execution of asset liability management strategies 
old national uses two modeling techniques to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company  net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
net interest income at risk is used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the impact of changing rates over a two year horizon 
economic value of equity is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
these models simulate the likely behavior of the company s net interest income and the likely change in the company s economic value due to changes in interest rates under various possible interest rate scenarios 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the company s net interest income and value  old national recognizes that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for this reason  old national models many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to best understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 
old national s board of directors  through its funds management committee  monitors the company s interest rate risk 
the funds management committee establishes policy guidelines for the allowable change in cumulative net interest income over a two year period and the change in economic value of equity in an basis point instantaneous parallel change to the yield curve basis point yield curve shock 
as of december   the guideline for net interest income at risk was of net interest income over a two year period in a basis point shock to the yield curve 
as of december   the guideline for the allowable fluctuation in economic value of equity was in a basis point shock to the yield curve 
in addition to the output of the model in basis point shocks to the yield curve  old national has provided the output of its rate risk model in and basis point yield curve shocks to provide a better understanding of old national s sensitivity to market interest rate changes 
as of december   old national projects that in a basis point shock to interest rates  net interest income at risk would be cumulatively over the next two years 
in a basis point shock to interest rates  old national projects net interest income at risk would be cumulatively over the next two years 
as of december   old national projects economic value of equity at in a basis point shock to interest rates and at in a basis point shock 
at december   modeling indicated old national was within its policy limit of net interest income at risk in a basis point interest rate shock 
estimated change in economic value of equity in a basis points yield curve shock was estimated at  well within the policy limit of 
estimated change in economic value of equity in a basis points yield curve shock was estimated at  which was outside of the company s policy guideline of 
the funds management committee has deemed this an acceptable risk given the company s outlook for rising interest rates 
estimated month estimated change cumulative impact on in economic interest rate net interest income value of equity change basis points policy actual policy actual at december   a notable change in the company s rate risk profile is reflected in the decrease in the company s estimated change in economic value of equity resulting from a basis points yield curve shock 
economic value of equity changed from in december to in december the company reduced its long term exposure to rising interest rates by reducing the effective duration of the investment portfolio to years at december   compared to years at december   by selling million of residential mortgages in june  and by executing million in forward starting interest rate swaps that become effective between january  and june  old national will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate on these derivatives beginning on future dates 
these derivatives will serve to fix the interest rates of future debt issuances 
the fixed interest rates range from to and have maturities of to years after the swaps become effective 
old national uses derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
the company s derivatives had an estimated fair value loss of million at december   compared to an estimated market gain of million at december  the decline in market value is due both to the increase in interest rates during the year and the fact that old national terminated certain receive fixed rate swaps 
as explained above  old national added forward starting pay fixed rate swaps in all of these transactions served to better position the company s balance sheet for rising rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
on january   the funds management committee approved new policy guidelines for the allowable change in net interest income at risk and the change in economic value of equity to enhance the monitoring of compliance within identified interest rate risk exposure zones 
red zone policy limits will represent old national s absolute interest rate risk exposure compliance limit 
policy limits defined as green zone will represent the range of potential interest rate risk exposures that the funds management committee believes to be normal and acceptable operating behavior 
yellow zone policy limits will represent a range of interest rate risk exposures falling below the bank s maximum allowable exposure red zone but above its normally acceptable interest rate risk levels green zone 
the new policy guidelines become effective for liquidity management the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and  along with the balance sheet management committee  monitors liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure old national has the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts 
the company maintains strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 
old national s ability to raise funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of the company s credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
all three rating agencies have issued a stable outlook in conjunction with their ratings as of december  the senior debt ratings of old national bancorp and old national bank at december   are shown in the following table 
senior debt ratings standard and poor s moody s investor services fitch  inc

old national bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of indianapolis  which provides a source of funding through fhlb advances 
old national maintains relationships in capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposits and short term and medium term bank notes as well 
in addition  at december   old national had million available for issuance under a billion global bank note program for senior and subordinated debt 
old national bancorp  the parent company  has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses  dividends to shareholders  debt service  net derivative cash flows and funds used for acquisitions 
old national bancorp obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities 
at december   the parent company s other borrowings outstanding was million  compared with million at december  the decrease in other borrowings in was driven by a million maturity of medium term notes payable and a million decline in derivative market values 
old national bancorp  the parent company  has no debt scheduled to mature within the next months 
federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
at december   prior regulatory approval was not required for old national s affiliate bank 
during  old national filed a form s for a million global shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  which became effective on december  the shelf permits the issuance of a variety of securities including debt  common and preferred stock  depositary shares  units and warrants of old national 
the proceeds of any issuance will be added to the general funds of the company and may be used for debt reduction or debt refinancing  including the refinancing of outstanding capital securities  investments in or advances to subsidiaries  repurchase of shares of common stock or other securities and other general corporate purposes 
at december   there were no borrowings under this shelf registration
