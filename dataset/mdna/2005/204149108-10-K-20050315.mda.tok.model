all per share data has been restated to reflect the stock dividend distributed on december  the increase in earnings is reflected in the corporation s return on average assets and return on average equity for return on average assets for was compared to and in and  respectively 
return on average equity for was compared to and in and  respectively 
the corporation s assets increased to billion at december  from the billion at december  the corporation experienced an increase of million in earning assets during the year the investment portfolio grew million and the loan portfolio grew million 
the growth in the investment portfolio was primarily a result of a million transaction completed in august  which increased our investment portfolio with funds borrowed from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  ohio 
loan growth has occurred in all three major loan categories  commercial  residential real estate  and consumer loans 
total deposits and repurchase agreements of billion at december  experienced growth of million from prior year end 
as was anticipated  the investment transaction completed in august has been accretive to earnings but has resulted in a lower net interest margin and return on average assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies loans loans are reported at the carrying value of unpaid principal reduced by unearned interest and an allowance for loan losses 
income is recorded on the level yield basis 
interest accrual is discontinued when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collateral value  and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
any loan greater than days past due must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest 
cash payments received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied against principal  and interest income is only recorded once principal recovery is reasonably assured 
loans are not reclassified as accruing until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear reasonably certain 
allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management using a methodology that includes several key factors 
the corporation utilizes an internal risk grading system for commercial credits  and those larger commercial credits identified through this grading system as having weaknesses are individually reviewed for the customer s ability and potential to repay their loans 
the borrower s cash flow  adequacy of collateral held for the loan  and other options available to the corporation including legal avenues are all evaluated 
based upon this individual credit evaluation  a specific allocation to the allowance may be made for the loan 
for other commercial loans that are not individually evaluated  an allowance allocation is determined by applying an eight quarter moving average historical loss rate for this group of loans 
consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded 
allowance allocations are provided for these pools of loans based upon an eight quarter moving average historical loss rate for each of these categories of loans 
an unallocated portion of the allowance is also determined in recognition of the inherent inability to precisely determine the loss potential in any particular loan or pool of loans 
the factors considered by management in determining this amount of inherent risk include delinquency trends  current economic conditions and trends  strength of the supervision and administration of the loan portfolio  level of nonperforming loans  trend in loan losses  recovery rates associated with previously charged off loans  concentrations within commercial credits  problem loan identification strengths and weaknesses  collateral evaluation strengths and weaknesses  and the level of financial statement exceptions 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and weighted as deemed appropriate by management 
the total of these weighted factors is then applied against the total loan portfolio and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
investments management determines the classification of securities at purchase 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the corporation classifies securities into held to maturity or available for sale categories 
held to maturity securities are those which the corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are those the corporation may decide to sell if needed for liquidity  asset liability management  or other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
if declines in fair value are not temporary  the carrying value of the securities is written down to fair value as a realized loss 
gains or losses on disposition of securities are computed by specific identification for all securities except for shares in mutual funds  which are computed by average cost 
interest and dividend income  adjusted by amortization of purchase premium or discount  is included in earnings 
mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value in the aggregate 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income 
goodwill the corporation evaluates total goodwill for impairment  based upon sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  using fair value techniques including multiples of price equity 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
effects of accounting changes consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either a the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or b the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the provisions of fin were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after january  the adoption of the provisions applicable to special purpose entities spes and all other variable interests obtained after january  did not have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
effective march   the corporation adopted the provisions of fin r applicable to non spes created prior to february  adoption of fin r had no impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
accounting for certain loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses the accounting for certain acquired loans that show evidence of credit deterioration since their origination ie impaired loans and for which a loss is deemed probable of occurring 
sop prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan loss on certain acquired loans within its scope 
sop is effective for loans that are acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the corporation will evaluate the applicability of this sop for all prospective loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the corporation does not anticipate this statement to have material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
application of accounting principles to loan commitments in march  the securities and exchange commission staff released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
this sab disallows the inclusion of expected future cash flows related to the servicing of a loan in the determination of the fair value of a loan commitment 
further  no other internally developed intangible asset should be recorded as part of the loan commitment derivative 
recognition of intangible assets would only be appropriate in a third party transaction  such as a purchase of a loan commitment or in a business combination 
the sab is effective for all loan commitments entered into after march   but does not require retroactive adoption for loan commitments entered into on or before march  adoption of this sab did not have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments in march  a consensus was reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the eitf reached a consensus on an other than temporary impairment model for debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and cost method investments 
the basic model developed to evaluate whether an investment within the scope of issue is other than temporarily impaired involves a three step process including determining whether an investment is impaired fair value less than cost  evaluating whether the impairment is other than temporary including the corporation s intent and ability to hold the impaired securities until the cost is recovered and  if other than temporary  requiring recognition of an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
the first step in the model used to determine other than temporary impairments shall be applied prospectively to all current and future investments in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  the second and third steps in the model have been delayed pending issuance of proposed fasb staff position eitf a  implementation guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
at december   the corporation had approximately million in gross unrealized losses  none of which is considered to be other than temporary impairment 
the corporation is evaluating the impact of this issue 
stock based employee compensation the corporation currently maintains two incentive stock option plans covering key employees  however  only one plan is active 
the stock option plan plan was approved by the board of directors and the shareholders in the plan had  shares authorized   of which were available at december  for future grants 
all options granted have a maximum term of ten years 
options granted as management retention options vest after five years  all other options vest ratably over four years 
the corporation has elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
under apb opinion no 
 because the exercise price of all employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
had compensation cost for the corporation s stock options granted in   and been determined under the fair value approach described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the corporation s net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december net income as reported stock based compensation expense tax effect net income pro forma basic net income per share as reported pro forma diluted net income per share as reported pro forma the fair value of the options presented above was estimated at the date of the grant using a black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for   and  respectively risk free interest rates of   and  dividend yields of   and  volatility factors of the expected market price of the corporation s common stock of   and  and a weighted average expected option life of   and in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of apb opinion no 
and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is the third quarter for calendar year companies  although early adoption is allowed 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  the compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
the corporation currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
the corporation has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions  as shown in the corporation s consolidated statement of cash flows  were million  million  and million  respectively  for   and the corporation currently expects to adopt sfas no 
r effective july   however  the corporation has not yet determined which of the aforementioned adoption methods it will use 
subject to a complete review of the requirements of sfas no 
r  based on stock options granted to employees through december  and stock options that were granted in january  the corporation expects that the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  will reduce both third quarter and fourth quarter net earnings by approximately million per share  diluted each

as was presented in the interest rate sensitivity table in the liquidity and market risk section that was included in the management discussion and analysis of the corporation s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the corporation s gap position on december  was relatively flat as the corporation had sold securities during the year and reinvested in securities with shorter maturities to offset the shortened term of its liabilities 
during  the corporation sold floating rate securities  us treasuries  and year mortgage backed securities and reinvested in agencies  municipals  and mortgage backed securities with a slightly longer duration  but with a favorable increase in the portfolio s taxable equivalent yield 
this extension of duration on the asset side of the balance sheet was the primary factor in the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity in a basis point increased rate environment declining from at december  to at december  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses that was added to the allowance was million as of december  compared to million for this provision represented a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level determined using the accounting estimates described above

foreclosed properties on december  were million  an increase from the million at december  during the fourth quarter of  the corporation was successful in obtaining title to million in real estate collateral from a problem credit that has been in foreclosure proceedings for approximately two years 
the property was recorded at cost which was lower than market value 
foreclosed properties consisted primarily of family residential real estate 
noninterest income noninterest income for the year ended december  of million was a increase from the million earned during increased deposit service charge income due to the overdraft honor program implemented in september and a increase in the overdraft fee effective june  gains on sales of securities  gains on sales of loans due to increased refinancing activity  and other noninterest income contributed to the increase in noninterest income year over year 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million from december  to december   securities gains increased million  gains on sales of loans increased million  and other noninterest income increased million 
as residential mortgage refinancing slowed  the corporation had a decrease in gains on sales of loans during the fourth quarter of while the increase in residential real estate loan refinancing activity  due to the low interest rate environment  resulted in higher noninterest income from the gains on sales of loans  noninterest income was negatively impacted by charges to our valuation reserve for capitalized mortgage servicing rights of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the impact to earnings per share for the years ended december  and was per share and per share  respectively 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense for the year was primarily attributable to increases in legal and professional fees  operating losses  and other noninterest expense 
legal and professional fees increased million from december  to december   primarily due to fees incurred as a result of implementing the overdraft honor program  operating losses increased million  and other noninterest expense increased million  including million in nonrecurring charges to miscellaneous expense 
salaries and employee benefits remained relatively flat to prior year at million  however  this line item included million in charges in relative to the corporation s performance incentive plan 
this plan requires a performance incentive payment to eligible employees if the corporation reaches goals established by the board of directors 
these goals were not met in  however  if they were met in  it was anticipated the cost would be approximately million 
our efficiency ratio was at year end compared to at year end the deposit to fte full time equivalent ratio decreased to million at december  from million at december  liquidity and market risk the objective of the corporation s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the corporation s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the corporation s consolidated balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates  and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity  and growth in core deposits 
as of december   the corporation had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in securities valued at estimated fair value designated as available for sale and available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
additional asset driven liquidity is provided by the remainder of the securities portfolio and the repayment of loans 
in addition to core deposit funding  the corporation also accesses a variety of other short term and long term funding sources 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
federal home loan bank advances were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in federal home loan bank advances was a result of a transaction completed in august  which increased our investment portfolio with funds borrowed from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  ohio  as discussed earlier in the management discussion and analysis 
as of december   the corporation had a million available borrowing position with the federal home loan bank 
the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased  and issuance of long term debt 
at december   the corporation had a million revolving line of credit  all of which is currently available to meet any future cash needs 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of securities and loan originations 
management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing consolidated balance sheet needs 
the corporation s stock repurchase program began in december with the authorization to acquire up to  shares and was increased by an additional  shares in july the corporation issued a press release on may  announcing its intention to repurchase up to  additional shares 
the corporation s stock repurchase program continues to be accretive to shareholder value 
during the year  the corporation acquired  shares of the corporation s stock 
as of december   a total of  shares have been repurchased through this program 
the following table shows board allocations and repurchases made through the stock repurchase program for the years through board allocations repurchases shares available for repurchase average price of shares total repurchased shares and average prices have been restated to reflect stock dividends that have occurred  however  board allocated shares have not been adjusted 
management considers interest rate risk one of the corporation s most significant market risks 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the corporation s net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
the corporation employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  which includes executive and senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the corporation s current exposure to interest rate risks is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming a basis point increase or decrease in rates  spread evenly over the twelve month period 
the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months the simulation model used a basis point increase in the yield curve spread evenly over a twelve month period 
the measurement at december  estimates that net interest income for the corporation would increase by over one year 
a basis point immediate and sustained decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the corporation has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
virtually all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
periodically  additional assets such as commercial loans are also sold 
in and  million and million  respectively  was realized on the sale of fixed rate residential mortgages 
management focuses its efforts on consistent net interest revenue and net interest margin growth through each of the retail and wholesale business lines 
the corporation does not currently engage in trading activities 
capital resources the corporation continues to grow its shareholders equity while also providing an average annual dividend yield during of to shareholders 
shareholders equity of million on december  is a increase from the million on december  the primary source of capital growth for the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for the corporation retained of its earnings in compared to in regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum capital ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than  and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were   and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc and it subsidiaries met the criteria for well capitalized at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
upon the early adoption of fin effective july   the corporation deconsolidated ctbi preferred capital trust and ctbi preferred capital trust ii  resulting in a recharacterization of the underlying consolidated debt obligations from the previous trust preferred securities obligations to junior subordinated debenture obligations 
under the current federal reserve board s regulatory framework  the junior subordinated debenture obligations both qualify as total capital for regulatory capital purposes 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether these capital securities should continue to qualify as tier capital as a result of deconsolidating the related trust preferred securities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals 
if the federal reserve board disallows the capital securities as tier regulatory capital  the effect of such a change could have a material impact on the corporation s regulatory ratios 
as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation  changing prices  and local economic conditions the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in non monetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
our success is dependent on the general economic conditions of the communities we serve 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide financial and banking services primarily to eastern  northeast  central  and south central kentucky and southern west virginia 
the economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on loan demand  the ability of borrowers to repay loans  and the value of the collateral securing loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions will affect these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
factors influencing general conditions include inflation  recession  unemployment  and other factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations and commitments as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the corporation has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments are contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total year years after years deposits without stated maturity certificates of deposit repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings advances from federal home loan bank interest on advances from federal home loan bank long term debt interest on long term debt annual rental commitments under leases total the amounts provided as interest on advances from federal home loan bank and interest on long term debt assume the liabilities will not be prepaid and interest is calculated to their individual maturities 
other commitments amount of commitment expiration by period in thousands total year years after years standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit total commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon
