item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under business risks related to our business and elsewhere in this report 
we utilize a fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to september for clarity of presentation  we have described all periods as if they end at the end of the calendar quarter 
overview we are a leading worldwide provider of flexible circuit interconnect solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems  in the electronics industry 
we offer a full range of customized flexible circuit applications and services from initial design  development and prototype to fabrication  assembly and test on a global basis 
we target high volume markets where miniaturization  form and weight are driving factors and flexible circuits are an enabling technology 
applications for flexible circuits currently addressed by us include data storage devices such as hard disk drives hdds  flat panel displays fpd including liquid crystal displays lcds for mobile communication devices and larger format screens  tape drives and printers 
our customers include m  hitachi  hp  maxtor  medtronic  philips  quantum  rosemount  sae magnetics a subsidiary of tdk  samsung  seagate  staktek  storagetek  xerox and other leading electronic oems 
net sales and revenue recognition we manufacture flexible circuits and perform certain additional assembly and test functions on these flexible circuits based on customer specifications 
we sell our products direct throughout the world  primarily in north america  europe and the pacific rim countries 
we use non exclusive sales representatives to augment our direct sales efforts  with sales through distributors representing less than of our total net sales for fiscal years  and we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment or delivery of our product to our customers  depending on the customer agreement or shipping terms 
we store some inventory in third party owned warehouses that are located close to customers manufacturing facilities 
sales from third party warehouses are recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgment of the receipt of the goods 
costs and expenses cost of sales consists primarily of material costs for raw materials and semi finished components used for assembly of our products  labor costs directly related to manufacture  assembly and inspection of our products  costs of general utilities  production supplies and chemicals consumed in the manufacturing processes  costs related to the maintenance of our manufacturing equipment and facilities  costs related to material and product handling and shipment  depreciation costs related to facilities  machinery and equipment used to manufacture  assemble and inspect our products  and salaries and overhead attributed to our supply chain  process engineering and manufacturing personnel 
selling  general  administrative and royalty expenses primarily consist of salaries and related selling commissions  travel  business development and program management  administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel expenses  other significant expenses related to external accounting  software maintenance and legal and regulatory fees  overhead attributed to our selling  general and administrative personnel  and royalties related to fsa net sales engineering expenses include costs associated with the design  development and testing of our products and processes 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and related development personnel expenses  overhead attributed to our development and test engineering personnel  and prototyping costs related to the development of new products 
restructuring charges are those costs primarily related to manufacturing facility closures  severance and product discontinuations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the planned closure of our maple plain facility and the plan to discontinue the support of the fsa attachment process 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges related to closing our chandler  arizona facility and transferring manufacturing operations to our minnesota and thailand locations 
because we initially underestimated the costs relating to this restructuring  we recorded additional restructuring charges in fiscal and as of march   the restructuring related to the closing of the chandler facility was substantially complete 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated for the years ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general  administrative and royalty engineering restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations net interest and other expense income loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and net sales our net sales were million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects higher flex suspension assembly fsa and flat panel display fpd revenue more than offsetting lower revenue generated by actuator flex circuit afc and stacked memory sales 
the fsa revenue increase was driven by the production ramp up of a new high end enterprise disk drive application in the fiscal second quarter 
the fpd revenue increase was related to a number of new program qualifications entering production over the last nine months of fiscal revenue growth was also accelerated by the high pass through material content associated with the assembly of components required for many of the new fpd and fsa products 
sales from the disk drive industry generated of our net sales for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september   fpd application net sales were versus  semiconductor packaging application net sales were compared to  network system application net sales were compared to and net sales from other industry applications were for the years ended september  and we expect fpd revenue to remain strong into fiscal as fpd programs remain in high volume production 
also  while we expect fsa revenue to decrease significantly when the disk drive industry transitions to its next generation of products in early calendar  our afc revenue should increase reflecting the significantly higher level of next generation  afc program qualifications 
gross profit our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  decreased to  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in gross profit and margin reflects numerous start up issues and inefficiencies caused by the sharp increase in new products entering production during the fiscal second quarter and the higher pass through material content of the new fsa and fpd programs which entered production during the year 
fiscal gross profit and margins were also impacted by the duplicate cost structures in place as the maple plain facility continued to operate while the new thailand facility was being brought on line 
the new thailand facility should be fully qualified on all product lines formerly manufactured in our maple plain facility and all remaining production operations at the maple plain facility should be discontinued by the end of the fiscal first quarter 
we anticipate that gross margins in fiscal will improve related to cost structure reductions from discontinuing production operations at maple plain  improved operating efficiencies and reductions in pass through material costs as a result of the product mix including lower levels of fsa revenue 
selling  general  administrative and royaltye selling  general  administrative and royalty expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  down significantly as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  administrative and royalty expenses were in fiscal and for fiscal as compared to fiscal  increased fiscal royalty expense related to higher fsa revenue was more than offset by lower payroll and contract services costs and lower depreciation related to the full years impact of organization structure changes made in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general  administrative and royalty expenses for fiscal are expected to decrease as a result of organizational cost reductions made in the fiscal fourth quarter and to be made in the fiscal first quarter related to the maple plain facility closure and lower royalty expense on fsa revenue 
engineering engineering expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
the increase in fiscal engineering expenses was primarily due to higher payroll expenses related to an increased focus on qualifying products and processes for new applications including flat panel displays and inkjet printers and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses were of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal engineering expenses for fiscal are expected to remain flat as compared to fiscal restructuring during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges of million and million related to the planned closure of the maple plain facility and the plan to discontinue support of the fsa attachment process 
the impairment was triggered by the lower than expected financial performance of the company during the quarter ending june resulting from the impact of the high fixed cost structure in place at that time on lower than expected revenue and the decision of our largest fsa customer to shift a significant level of next generation business to a competing technology 
the assets that were impaired included the maple plain facility and related equipment and equipment used in the fsa attachment process 
the fair value of these assets was determined using quoted market prices where available and appraised values or estimated future cash flows where more definitive values were not available 
the maple plain building was written down at june  to its expected net realizable value   the building has been listed for sale since september the assets used to support the fsa attachment process were written down to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the fsa attachment equipment over its expected remaining operating life which ranged from to months as of june  the assets are expected to have no net realizable value at the end of their expected remaining operating life 
in order to reduce our cost structure  we are closing our maple plain facility and consolidating its operations with our lamphun  thailand and litchfield  minnesota facilities 
in addition  we plan to discontinue supporting the fsa attachment process in order to utilize its resources in other growth areas where we believe we have an advantage 
the total restructuring charges are expected to be approximately million  consisting of the million asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal and approximately million of other restructuring charges 
the asset impairment charge had no cash flow impact 
the million is expected to be comprised of million for one time termination benefits  million for contract termination costs and million for other moving and closing costs associated with the consolidation of the maple plain location with our other locations 
the one time termination benefits and moving and closing costs are expected to have a negative impact on cash flow as the costs are incurred 
charges of million related to this restructuring have been recorded through september   of which restructuring charges of million and million were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the charges for fiscal were comprised of  for one time termination benefits and  related to moving and closing costs 
we expect to incur the remaining expected restructuring charges of million during the first six months of fiscal as expected  capital expenditures of approximately million were incurred in connection with the restructuring primarily related to the expansion of the lamphun thailand facility through fiscal as part of the june restructuring  engineering support of future fsa attachment development was discontinued 
we are continuing to maintain engineering support of fsa attachment programs which were in production or programs for which we are qualified for future production 
as the fsa programs reach their end of life  we will lower the level of engineering and production personnel supporting them 
we will continue to develop flexible circuits to be used by other companies for their fsa development needs but we are not allocating any personnel or resources to develop or support future internal fsa attachment programs 
as of june   we estimated an annual operating expense reduction of approximately million related to the restructuring charges 
million of this amount was expected to be realized by the end of the september quarter based on actions taken in june and july the remaining savings were expected to occur after the maple plain facility is closed and its operations transferred to our lamphun thailand and litchfield minnesota locations 
approximately million of the operating cost reductions were projected to be compensation related and have a positive impact on cash flow upon realization 
the remaining benefits were expected to be depreciation and contract termination related and have no impact on cash flow 
through september   operating cost savings of approximately million per quarter have been realized primarily comprised of compensation savings of  per quarter or million on an annual basis and depreciation and contract termination savings of  per quarter or million on an annual basis 
the full benefit of actions taken during the quarter ending september  and to be taken during the quarter ending december  should result in an additional cost savings realization of approximately million per quarter by the march quarter 
the original restructuring plan called for the elimination of positions comprised of direct labor positions  indirect labor production support positions and administrative positions 
as of september   positions have been eliminated and the overall plan remains substantially unchanged 
net interest and other expense net interest expense was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
interest expense increased in primarily due to an increase in interest bearing debt during fiscal primarily caused by capital expenditures related to the thailand facility expansion 
net other income was  in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended september  income taxes income tax expense for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to a benefit of million for the fiscal year ended september  the tax expense for fiscal related to a charge to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to zero as a result of our net operating loss position 
the tax benefit for fiscal was calculated at a rate lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the exclusion of income generated from our foreign operating corporation and the exclusion of restructuring charges 
comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and net sales our net sales were million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of 
this increase was the result of higher sales generated by disk drive  semiconductor packaging and flat panel display fpd applications being partially offset by decreases in revenue from non strategic consumer product lines 
the increased disk drive sales were related to our improved actuator flex afc market share as additional afc programs entered production 
semiconductor packaging net sales increased due to higher demand from our stacked memory customers in early fiscal the fpd sales improvement was related to new fpd programs beginning to ramp late in the fiscal year 
sales from the disk drive industry generated of our net sales for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september   net sales from semiconductor packaging applications were compared to  fpd application net sales were versus  network system application net sales were compared to and net sales from other industry applications were compared to for the years ended september  and  respectively 
gross profit our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  decreased to  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in gross margin was primarily related to a higher fixed cost structure put in place to meet higher expected demand for afc and fpd products 
revenue from afc and fpd products was lower than expected due to inventory corrections in the disk drive industry and a customer delay of the production ramp up of new fpd programs resulting in higher than expected unabsorbed overhead expenses 
selling  general  administrative and royalty selling  general  administrative and royalty expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  virtually unchanged as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  administrative and royalty expenses were in fiscal and for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal  increased fiscal spending for sarbanes oxley related consulting and higher payroll costs were offset by lower depreciation costs and training costs related to implementation of the company wide six sigma program during fiscal engineering engineering expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
the increase in fiscal engineering expenses was primarily due to increased spending on qualifying products and processes for new applications including flat panel displays and inkjet printers and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses were of sales for both the fiscal year ended september  and restructuring during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the planned closure of our maple plain facility and the plan to discontinue the support of the fsa attachment process 
related to this restructuring  we recorded asset impairment charges of million and restructuring charges of million during the last two quarters of fiscal these charges were comprised of  for one time termination benefits   related to contract termination costs and  related to moving and closing costs 
the assets that were impaired included the maple plain facility and related equipment and equipment used in the fsa attachment process 
the fair value of these assets was determined using quoted market prices where available and appraised values or estimated future cash flows where more definitive values were not available 
restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended september  were  in fiscal  the charges were recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs  primarily to buy out the remainder of the chandler  arizona facility lease through its june termination 
as of september   the restructuring was substantially complete 
net interest and other expense net interest expense was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to average interest bearing debt being million lower for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  net other income was  in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to net other expense of  in the fiscal year ended september  the increase was the result of foreign currency exchange gains being incurred in fiscal while a foreign currency exchange loss was generated in fiscal and the write off of loan origination fees related to the us based credit facility that was paid off in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  the tax benefit for fiscal was calculated at a rate lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the exclusion of income generated from our foreign operating corporation and the exclusion of restructuring charges 
as of september   we had determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize the tax benefit in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories  which are composed of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  our cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly different than the established reserves  a revision to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
goodwill 
we have determined goodwill relates to one reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
if events or circumstances change  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by operations  goodwill could become impaired and result in a charge to earnings 
deferred taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established where the realization of any deferred taxes becomes less likely than not to occur 
we analyze the valuation allowance periodically which may result in income tax expense being different than statutory rates 
revenue recognition 
we make electronic components flexible circuits based on customer specifications 
our revenue recognition policy is consistently applied regardless of sales channels utilized and product destination 
we have an implied warranty that the products meet our customers specification 
credits only are issued for customer returns 
in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  a binding purchase order is used as evidence of an arrangement 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment or delivery of our products to our customers  depending upon the customer agreement or shipping terms 
we also store inventory in warehouses jit hubs third party owned warehouses that are located close to our customers manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from jit hubs upon the transfer of title and risk of loss which follows our customers acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities  sales of equity securities  bank credit facilities and employee stock option exercises 
cash and equivalents were million at september  and million at september  net cash used by operating activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to  in the fiscal year ended september  for fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was the result of increases in accounts receivable and inventory more than offsetting increased accounts payable and the net of the pretax loss and non cash charges for deferred tax allowance charges and depreciation 
accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable all increased as a result of the increased level of pass through material content in the new fsa and fpd programs which entered production during the year 
net cash used by operating activities was  in the fiscal year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended september  for fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was the result of increases in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets more than offsetting increased accounts payable and the net of the pretax loss and non cash charges for restructuring and depreciation 
accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable all increased as a result of the fpd program ramp ups beginning near the end of fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to non cash charges for restructuring and depreciation more than offsetting the pre tax loss for the period and the increase in accounts receivable at september  from september  as a result of the increased level of sales at the end of september  net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited from an increase in accounts payable for the same period as a result of the increased manufacturing activity levels and by decreases in inventory and the receipt of a tax refund 
a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from the payment of accrued restructuring charges during the period reduced the net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was attributed to the purchase of equipment to manufacture copper clad polyimide  spending related to the expansion of our thailand facility and the purchase of equipment required to meet our expected increase in production of flexible circuits for fpd applications net of proceeds from the sale of the acquired eastlake  ohio facility 
fiscal net cash used in investing activity was the result of capital expenditures including capacity increases for selected processes related to the expected increase in fpd and afc sales  new equipment to support the next fsa generation product  thailand capacity expansion and upgrades of current capabilities 
in the fiscal year ended september   net cash used in investing activities was attributed to the purchase of test equipment and equipment to expand capacity in selected areas 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was the result of the million borrowed under our short term thailand credit facilities  borrowed under our new us federal credit union credit facility and a million draw down under our long term thailand credit facilities partially offset by scheduled debt payments on our existing thailand debt facilities and us based capital leases 
fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from our new thailand long and short term credit facilities more than offsetting scheduled payments made under our existing credit facilities 
during the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of net proceeds from a follow on stock offering of million partially offset by the pay down of interest bearing debt 
in june  we entered into a new credit facility with bank of ayudhya public company limited bay and the industrial finance corporation of thailand ifct which expanded the existing credit facility with these banks 
ifct merged with thai military bank during with the surviving bank being named thai military bank tmb 
the long term facilities were increased by  million baht  the packing credit facility was increased by million baht and the short term working capital facility was increased by million baht 
the facility is now comprised of a million baht long term facility  a million baht long term facility  a million baht long term facility  a million baht long term facility  packing credit facilities totaling  million baht  short term working capital facilities totaling million baht and a million baht overdraft facility 
the thailand credit facilities are secured by certain receivables  inventory and assets held by us in thailand 
as of september   approximately million was outstanding under the long term thailand credit facilities and million under the packing credit facilities 
total unused availability under the thailand credit facilities as of september  was approximately million related to the packing credit and working capital facilities 
in april  the company entered into a new financing arrangement with us federal credit union us federal pursuant to which the company borrowed million in addition to the million the company had previously borrowed from us federal in january the total borrowing of million is under a note and secured by the company s maple plain and litchfield facilities 
monthly principal and interest payments are due under the note which bears interest at a rate of per annum 
monthly principal payments are determined using a year amortization schedule with any remaining unpaid balance due on february  we believe that with our existing us and thailand credit facilities and cash generated from operations  we will have adequate funds to support projected working capital and capital expenditures for the next twenty four months 
we are considering alternatives for generating additional working capital and long term financing and will continue to pursue financing opportunities to better leverage our assets 
our financing needs and the financing alternatives available to us are subject to change depending on  among other things  general economic and market conditions  changes in industry buying patterns  customer acceptance of our fsa  afc  stacked memory flex and fpd flex products and cash flow from operations 
contractual obligations the table below discloses a summary of the company s specified contractual obligations at september  in thousands under year to years to years after years total long term debt obligations operating leases total includes interest at fixed rate of on a portion of the debt and excludes interest on all debt with variable interest rates 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees at an amount determined by the fair value of the options 
sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning october  as such  effective with the company s first fiscal quarter of fiscal  sfas no 
r will eliminate our ability to account for stock options using the method permitted under apb and instead require us to recognize compensation expense should the company issue stock options to its employees or non employee directors 
the company intends to apply the modified prospective method and estimates that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in approximately  of compensation expense in fiscal in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
the provisions of this statement become effective for us in fiscal sfas amends the existing guidance on the recognition of inventory costs to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
existing rules indicate that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the valuation of inventory or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement addresses the fair value concepts contained in opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions which included certain exceptions to the concept that exchanges of similar productive assets should be recorded at the carrying value of the asset relinquished 
sfas eliminates that exception and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that lack commercial substance 
only nonmonetary exchanges in which an entity s future cash flows are expected to significantly change as a result of the exchange will be considered to have commercial substance 
sfas must be applied to nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results 
the fasb issued two final fasb staff positions fsps addressing the financial accounting for certain provisions of the american jobs creation act of act 
a provision of the act allows taxpayers a deduction equal to the percentage of the lesser of the taxpayer s qualified domestic production activities income or taxable income subject to a limitation of of annual wages paid 
fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  addresses whether the qualified domestic production activities should be treated as a special deduction or a rate reduction under sfas no 
additionally  another provision of the act provides taxpayers a special  one time dividend received deduction for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company s first taxable year beginning on or after the date of the act s enactment or the last taxable year beginning before such date 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results 
forward looking statements statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  elsewhere in this report and in future filings by the company with the sec  except for the historical information contained herein and therein  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties are set forth under business risks related to our business in this annual report and include the timely availability and acceptance of products including the fpd flexible circuits  next generation products for disk drive and semiconductor packaging substrate applications  the impact of competitive products and pricing specifically including our largest customer increasing utilization of an alternative technology that competes with our fsa product resulting in fsa revenue expected to be significantly lower in future disk drive generations  interruptions in the operations of our single source suppliers  impact of restructuring charges  changes in manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is generated from the disk drive  semiconductor packaging substrates  consumer electronics and data storage industries and the effect of world wide economic conditions on flexible circuit demand may have an adverse impact on our operations 
we disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we transact business predominately in us dollars a portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  we enter into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage our risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of months or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange thailand baht for us dollars or us dollars for thailand baht at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges  therefore  the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in income 
we periodically review the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short or balanced for those currencies in which we have significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   we had open forward exchange contracts to buy thailand baht maturing october   october   november   november   november  and march  with notional amounts of million baht  million baht  million baht  million baht  million baht and million baht  respectively 
the total open contracts for  million baht equates to approximately million 
no assurance can be given that our strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a large portion of our interest bearing debt is subject to interest rates which fluctuate with changes in market interest rates or are periodically reset based on market interest rates 
a large change in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations
