in this regard  gaap refers to generally accepte d accounting principles in the united states 
additionally  ebitda is a basis upo n which our management assesses financial performance and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in measuring the operating performance and creditworthiness of companies with comparable market capitalization to the company  many of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
furthermore  ebitda is one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
ebitda is widely used by the company to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies du e to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered a primary measure of the company s performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with  and not as substitute for  financial measurements prepared in accordance with gaap that are presented in this form k 
a reconciliation of the calculation of ebitda  is presented below 
k for the year ended december   cash flows from operations included million of income tax refunds resulting primarily from the loss on divestiture of assets
