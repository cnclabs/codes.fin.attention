all forward looking statements included herein are based upon information presently available  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  asset impairment  intangible assets and inventory and accounts receivable 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  accounting policies  for a summary of each significant accounting policy 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue related to sales of our products and systems is generally recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered  the title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we accrue related product return reserves and warranty expenses at the time of sale 
additionally  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if economic or political conditions were to change in the countries where we do business  it could have a significant impact on the results of operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable 
furthermore  we are dependent on customers in the retail markets 
economic difficulties experienced in those markets could have a significant impact on our results of operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value  less disposal costs and reasonable profit margin  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill  but test for impairment of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we completed our annual impairment test as of october  and determined that there was no goodwill impairment to be recognized 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units included a cash flow periods of years  b terminal values based upon a terminal growth rate of  and c a discount rate of  which was based on the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and software development costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends 
research and development software development costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses may fluctuate due to the timing of expenditures for the varying states of research and product development and the availability of capital resources 
we capitalize costs incurred for internally developed product software where economic and technological feasibility has been established and for qualifying purchased product software 
we assess the recoverability of our software development costs against estimated future revenue over the remaining economic life of the software 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization is our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
see the section on forward looking statements included at the beginning of this item on management s discussion and analysis for a listing of factors that may affect the achievement of our forecasted taxable income 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
the company operates within federal  state and international taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures 
exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the liabilities are reviewed on an ongoing basis for their adequacy and appropriateness 
to the extent the audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized in the provision for income taxes line in our consolidated statement of operations in the period of the event

fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
that was issued in january companies are required to apply fin r to vies generally as of march  and to special purpose entities as of december  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts  and any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest would be recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
fsp no 
provides guidance with respect to reporting the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act on an enterprise s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october   and provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by a company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
although the act was signed into law in october  the practical application of a number of the provisions of the repatriation provision remains unclear 
tax authorities are expected to provide clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision 
we have conducted a preliminary identification of potential repatriation and reinvestment opportunities  however  the clarifying language may affect our evaluation of the economic value of implementing any individual opportunity and its ability to meet the overall qualifying criteria 
as a result  we will be unable to complete a determination of the act s effect on our plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings until the clarifying language is released 
in december  the fasb issued statement no

this statement requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim period beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the permitted transition methods include either retrospective or prospective adoption 
under the retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period presented 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or effect of adopting sfas r  and have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas see accounting for stock options in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

overview we are experts in optical image capture and processing solutions 
in recent years  we have increased sales  cash flow from operations and net income primarily through the introduction of new products  penetration into new markets and a focus on cost reduction activities to maintain a competitive advantage 
success factors critical to our business include sales growth through continued penetration within our existing markets through new product introductions and expanded sales efforts  entering into new markets  maintaining a highly responsive and cost efficient infrastructure  achieving the financial flexibility to ensure that we can respond to new market opportunities in order to return value to our shareholders  and selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions 
in order to continue our penetration into new and existing markets  our strategy involves expanding our sales channels and expanding our product development activities 
we have concentrated our direct sales efforts to further penetrate some of the largest retailers in the united states as well as focusing on the early adoption of bar coding technology in the healthcare industry 
during fiscal  we added several new key retail accounts which contributed to our year over year sales growth of 
another key factor in achieving this double digit sales growth has been our ability to continue our growth in eastern europe and throughout asia 
we believe these geographic areas will continue to be an opportunity for continued growth  as evidenced by our investment in the expansion of our suzhou manufacturing facility which was completed in the third quarter of as well as the opening of new sales offices in these territories 
in addition  we continue to invest in developing new and improved products to meet the changing needs of our existing customers 
we are continuing to focus on executing our core strategy of leveraging our engineering expertise to produce new bar code scanners and industrial automation products that will allow us to penetrate new markets that we have not previously served and gain market share in our existing markets 
furthermore  we currently have several promising new products in the pipeline 
we continue to believe sales for and beyond will be positively affected as these new products either begin to ship or ship in larger quantities 
to maintain a highly responsive and cost efficient infrastructure  our focus is to maximize the efficiency of our organization through process improvements and cost containment 
we continue to focus on our strategy for margin expansion through specific engineering initiatives to reduce product and manufacturing costs 
during the year ended december   we continued to realize the benefits of these process improvements 
in addition  the expansion of our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china was completed during the third quarter of this expansion nearly doubled the size of the existing china operations and more importantly  is providing cost efficiencies through lower direct labor costs as we continue to produce more of our products in this facility 
during fiscal approximately of our data capture collection products were manufactured in our suzhou  china manufacturing facility  an increase of approximately from fiscal we intend to expand our manufacturing capabilities at our suzhou  china facility in fiscal to continue to take advantage of these cost efficiencies 
the factors discussed above are key contributors to the year over year growth of approximately in our gross margin percentage closely linked to the success factors discussed above is our continued focus to achieve financial flexibility 
in october  we completed a follow on public offering  which provided us with net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of those net proceeds to pay down existing indebtedness and purchase our blackwood  new jersey facility 
we are using the remaining net proceeds to fund working capital requirements for continued growth of our business 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately million 
furthermore  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december  we believe that our current cash and working capital positions and expected operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital  planned capital expenditures and debt repayment requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to our internal development and organic growth  we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will broaden or complement our current technology base and allow us to serve additional end users and the evolving needs of our existing customers 
in march  we purchased the remaining interest in metrologic eria france for approximately million euros  or million at the exchange rate on march  during september  we acquired of the common stock of omniplanar inc omniplanar  an imaging software company for approximately million 
omniplanar supplies a complete package of bar code reading software for d imaging for fixed position  conveyor belt and hand held readers which can be optimized for specific hardware applications 
our acquisition of omniplanar broadened and strengthened our portfolio of decoding software to include robust omnidirectional decoding of linear  matrix and postal bar code images 
metrologic has licensed from omniplanar the swiftdecoder software since the year for use in our iq r line of industrial vision based products 
we also intend to make use of the software in other products as well 
by acquiring this d imaging technology  we will be able to reduce our licensing costs for our current and future imaging based products 
we expect this acquisition to be accretive to sales and earnings on a prospective basis 
forward looking statements contained in this overview are highly dependent upon a variety of important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
for list of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations  refer to the section on forward looking statements included at the beginning of this item on management s discussion and analysis 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
december  sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses severance costs total operating expenses operating income other income expenses  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income our business is divided into two major segments data capture collection  and industrial automation and optical systems 
bar code scanners are typically either handheld scanners or fixed projection scanners 
handheld bar code scanners are principally suited for retail point of sale  document processing  library  healthcare and inventory applications 
fixed projection scanners  which can be mounted on or in a counter  are principally suited for supermarkets  convenience stores  mass merchandisers  health clubs and specialty retailers 
industrial automation products are comprised of fixed position systems that are either laser or vision based 
these systems range from simple  one scanner solutions to complex  integrated systems incorporating multi scanner  image capture and dimensioning technologies 
optical systems are comprised of advanced electro optical systems including wavefront sensors  adaptive optics systems and custom instrumentation 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding our revenues by our two business segments for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands data capture collection    industrial automation optical systems industrial automation    optical    total industrial automation optical systems    total company    most of our product sales in western europe  brazil and asia are billed in foreign currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a significant percentage of our products are manufactured in our us facility and  therefore  sales and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 
manufacture of our point of sale products in our suzhou  china facility accounted for approximately and of point of sale unit sales in and  respectively 
in and  sales and gross profit were favorably affected by the continuing decline in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain foreign currencies  especially the euro 
the following table sets forth certain information as to our sales by geographical location year ended december  dollars in thousands north america    europe    rest of world    total    we derive revenue from product sales  engineering development  system maintenance and other services 
our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  labor costs related to service revenues  the costs associated with quality control and the payment of royalties on license agreements 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses primarily consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and sales support functions  costs associated with other marketing activities  salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  legal and human resources personnel  and professional fees and corporate expenses 
research and development r d expenses primarily consist of salaries and expenses for development and engineering and prototype costs 
we also participate in government and customer funded research programs 
costs of the engineers working on such programs are charged to cost of sales for the time spent on the programs 
when the engineers are not working on these programs  they are available to work on our own internal development projects and their costs are included in research and development expense 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased to million in from million in the increase was attributed to higher sales in both the data capture collection and industrial automation optical systems business segments 
sales of our data capture collection products increased by  sales of industrial automation products increased by  and sales of optical systems increased by 
approximately million of the increase in data capture collection sales resulted from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in data capture collection sales increased approximately million due to increased unit sales of our handheld scanners 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million resulting from lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures experienced in the retail sector during  in all geographic regions 
the increase in the industrial automation product sales is primarily due to continued sales under a contract with a large systems integrator for use in a new automated parcel and package system for the us postal service  ongoing integration services with regard to a contract with a major airline customer for bar code scanning equipment and installation services to build and install scanning stations and tunnels for use in baggage handling systems  and also the sales contribution from our omniplanar acquisition which closed at the end of the third quarter of the increase in optical system sales reflects an increase in ongoing customer funded research and development programs  an increase in the scope of work of selected cost plus type contracts during the year  and the completion of certain short term fixed price contracts in international sales accounted for million or of total sales in and million  or of total sales in the increase in international sales was from increased sales in our europe and row geographic regions 
no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues in or the increase in european sales can be attributed to increased unit volume along with the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  offset by lower average selling prices 
the increase in our unit volume within europe is attributed to increased sales though our expansive distributor network coupled with the addition of several new key end user accounts 
the increase in our row sales is primarily attributable to year over year growth due to continued penetration into both new and existing key markets 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in compared with in the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales in was due to the following o the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  as discussed above  net of the decreases in average selling prices 
o a decrease in direct labor costs as a percent of sales as a result of increased unit production in our suzhou  china facility during o a decrease in direct material costs as a percent of sales resulting from cost reduction initiatives  primarily product redesigns lowering our bill of material costs 
o a decrease in royalty costs due to a reduction in the number of products covered by the agreement between symbol o technologies and the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  located elsewhere in this document 
o more favorable product mix resulting from increased sales of certain more profitable handheld scanners in o lower overhead expenses  including a decrease in rent expense due to the purchase of the blackwood manufacturing o facility in december and a decrease in indirect labor attributed to efficiencies in manufacturing engineering and product support efforts 
these factors were partially offset by increased sales of certain lower margin products  including our portable data terminals that are not manufactured by us  but purchased from other sources 
these items generally have margins lower than our own manufactured products 
sg a expenses increased million or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in as compared with in the increase in sg a expenses was due to increased variable selling expenses associated with the higher sales volume in  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar on euro denominated expenses  increased professional service fees related to our sarbanes oxley section compliance  an increase in legal costs associated with ongoing litigation matters  and an increase in personnel costs as we started to increase our infrastructure to support the increased sales levels during and beyond 
r d expenses increased million or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in as compared with in in absolute dollars  the increase in r d expenses  which consists primarily of higher salaries and r d material costs  was the result of ongoing new product development efforts including expanded efforts focused on our development of the iq camera based vision system 
net interest income expense reflects million of net interest income in compared to million of net interest expense in the decrease can be attributed to the following factors i lower interest expense and related outstanding borrowings in due to repayments and or termination of outstanding debt issuances during fiscal and ii higher interest income due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from the proceeds received from the follow on public offering that closed in october interest expense in includes million of unamortized original issue discount associated with repayment of the subordinated note to mr 
and mrs 
knowles in october other income expense reflects net other income of million in compared to net other income of million in the decrease in other income was due to i a million gain on the early repayment of subordinated debt related to the acquisition of aoa in  offset by ii foreign exchange gains of million in as compared with foreign exchange gains of million in  and iii million of bank charges in incurred in connection with our efforts to refinance our bank debt and restructure our overall debt position that enabled us to realize the gain on early extinguishment of debt 
net income was million in as compared with million in net income reflects a and effective income tax rate in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the recognition of research development tax credits 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of our data capture collection products 
sales of our data capture collection products increased by  sales of industrial automation products increased by  while sales of optical systems decreased by 
approximately million of the increase in data capture collection sales resulted from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in data capture collection sales increased approximately million due to increased unit sales of our handheld scanners  of which million was attributed to the introduction of new products in these factors were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million resulting from lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures experienced in the retail sector during  primarily in europe 
the increase in the industrial automation product sales is primarily due to increased sales attributable to i a contract with a large systems integrator for use in a new automated parcel and package system for the us postal service  and ii a contract with a major airline customer for bar code scanning equipment and installation services to build and install scanning stations and tunnels for use in baggage handling systems 
the decrease in optical system sales reflects the termination of certain optical projects at aoa in these projects included certain government contracts related to programs that were cancelled or downsized by the government as well as purchase orders from a customer involved in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
revenue from these customers was million in as compared with million in which included a million negotiated settlement for purchase order cancellations from one customer 
these purchase order cancellations were the result of our customer s excess capacity due to an acquisition 
international sales accounted for million or of total sales in and million  or of total sales in the largest portion of the growth in international sales was from increased sales in europe 
no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues in or the increase in european sales can be attributed to increased unit volume along with the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  offset by lower average selling prices 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in compared with in the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales in was due to the following o the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  as discussed above  net of the decreases in average selling prices 
o a decrease in direct labor costs as a percent of sales as a result of increased unit production in our suzhou  china facility and the workforce reductions in o a decrease in direct material costs as a percent of sales resulting from product redesigns lowering our bill of material costs 
o a decrease in royalty costs due to a reduction in the number of products covered by the agreement between symbol technologies and the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  located elsewhere in this document 
o more favorable product mix resulting from increased sales of certain more profitable handheld scanners in these factors were partially offset by increased sales of certain lower margin products  including our portable data terminals that are not manufactured by us  but purchased from other sources 
these items generally have margins lower than our own manufactured products 
sg a expenses increased million or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in as compared with in sg a expenses in included million of expenses incurred prior to the finalization of the amended and restated credit agreement that was executed on july  excluding these expenses  sg a expenses were million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were of sales in compared with excluding the financing related expenses of million in the increase in sg a expenses was due to increased variable selling expenses associated with the higher sales volume in  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar on euro denominated expenses  increased marketing expenses and an increase in incentive compensation expense during these increases were partially offset by lower personnel costs resulting from workforce reductions in r d expenses remained relatively flat in dollars at million in compared to million in  however  as a percent of sales  r d expenses decreased to of sales from of sales 
the decrease in r d expenses was the result of expanded r d efforts focused on our development of the iq camera based acquisition vision system during severance costs in of million is attributed to workforce reductions in march  april  august  and september net interest expense decreased by to million in from million in the decrease is due to lower outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates in interest expense in includes million of unamortized original issue discount associated with repayment of the subordinated note to mr 
and mrs 
knowles in october interest expense in includes million of additional interest expense that resulted from the incremental basis point default interest rate charged by our bank group from april  to july  other income expense reflects net other income of million in compared to net other expenses of million in the increase in other income was due to i a million gain on the early repayment of subordinated debt related to the acquisition of aoa  ii foreign exchange gains of million in as compared with foreign exchange losses of million in  and iii million of bank charges in incurred in connection with our efforts to refinance our bank debt and restructure our overall debt position that enabled us to realize the gain on early extinguishment of debt 
net income was million in as compared with million in net income reflects a and effective income tax rate in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the million gain on early extinguishment of debt which  for tax purposes  was treated as a reduction of the purchase price of aoa  and as such was not subject to federal or state income tax 
inflation and seasonality inflation and seasonality have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
however  our sales are typically impacted by decreases in seasonal demand from european customers in our third quarter 
we have historically experienced our strongest quarter during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
for quarterly results of operations  see supplementary data following the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for the period ended december  net cash provided from operations increased million  or from million in to million in net cash provided by operating activities in can be attributed primarily to net income of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million  offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable of million

foreign currency exchange our liquidity has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the brazilian real  the singapore dollar and the chinese renminbi 
in an effort to mitigate the financial implications of the volatility in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  we may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments to offset our exposure to foreign currency risks 
derivative financial instruments may include i foreign currency forward exchange contracts with our primary bank for periods not exceeding six months  which partially hedge sales to our german subsidiary and ii euro based loans  which act as a partial hedge against outstanding intercompany receivables and the net assets of our european subsidiary  which are denominated in euros 
additionally  our european subsidiary invoices and receives payment in certain other major currencies  including the british pound  which results in an additional mitigating measure that reduces our exposure to the fluctuation between the euro and the us dollar although it does not offer protection against fluctuations of that currency against the us dollar 
no derivative instruments were outstanding at december  acquisition of minority interests our original interest in metrologic eria iberica contained an option for us to purchase the remaining interest 
the purchase price under the option is calculated based on a twelve month multiple of sales and provides us with a twelve month period in which to find a buyer or negotiate a purchase price with a default minimum 
in  we agreed to purchase the of metrologic eria iberica that we did not own for approximately million euros 
payments will be made over years commencing in august as of december   we had purchased an additional  of which was purchased during the year ended december  for approximately million euros or million at the exchange rate on december  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments less than over contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases      option to purchase minority interest in mei    total contractual cash obligations      total less amounts than over other commercial committed year years years years commitments in thousands revolving credit facility   item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments 
the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and position is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
interest rate risk 
our bank loans expose our earnings to changes in short term interest rates  since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable 
the fair values of our bank loans are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the impact on earnings of a hypothetical change in interest rates on our outstanding debt would have been approximately million and million in and  respectively 
actual results may differ 
foreign exchange risk 
we periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  namely the euro  thereby mitigating our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
principal transactions hedged are intercompany sales and payments 
a large percentage of our foreign sales are transacted in foreign local currencies 
as a result  our international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro could have had an impact of million and million on our net earnings in and  respectively 
actual results may differ 
we are subject to risk from fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar for our european subsidiaries  which use the euro as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
such changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in other comprehensive income loss 
at december  and  we had translation exposure 
the potential effect on other comprehensive income loss resulting from a hypothetical change in the quoted euro rate amounts to million in and  respectively 
actual results may differ 
in addition  we held debt denominated in euros at december  and  and recognized foreign currency translation adjustments in net income 
the potential effect resulting from a hypothetical adverse change on the quoted euro rate amounts to million and million in and  respectively 
actual results may differ
