item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview new jersey resources njr or the company is an energy services holding company providing retail natural gas service in the state of new jersey and wholesale natural gas and related energy services to customers in states from the gulf coast to new england  and canada 
its principal subsidiary  new jersey natural gas njng  is a natural gas utility  which provides regulated retail natural gas service in central and northern new jersey and also participates in the off system sales and capacity release markets 
njng is regulated by the new jersey board of public utilities bpu 
njr s most significant unregulated subsidiary  njr energy services njres  provides unregulated wholesale energy services 
the retail and other segment includes njr home services njrhs  which provides service  sales and installation of appliances  njr energy  an investor in energy related ventures  commercial realty and resources cr r  which holds and develops commercial real estate  and njr investment  which makes energy related equity investments 
net income and assets by business segment are as follows thousands net income natural gas distribution energy services retail and other total thousands assets natural gas distribution energy services retail and other total natural gas distribution operations have been managed with the goal of growing profitably without the need for traditional base rate increases 
njng  working together with the bpu and the new jersey division of the ratepayer advocate  has been able to accomplish this goal for more than years through several key initiatives including managing its customer growth  which is expected to total about percent annually 
generating earnings from various bpu authorized gross margin sharing incentive programs  which are currently approved through october  reducing the impact of weather on njng s earnings through an updated weather normalization clause wnc 
managing the volatility of wholesale natural gas prices through a hedging program to help keep customers prices as stable as possible 
improving its cost structure through various productivity initiatives 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as a regulated company  njng is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements 
as a result  significant costs are deferred and treated as regulatory assets pending bpu decisions regarding their ultimate recovery from customers 
the most significant costs incurred that are subject to this accounting treatment include manufactured gas plant mgp remediation costs and wholesale natural gas costs 
actual remediation costs may vary from management s estimates due to the developing nature of remediation requirements and related litigation 
see item legal proceedings manufactured gas plant remediation and long branch mgp site litigation 
if there are changes in the regulatory position on the recovery of these costs  such costs would be charged to income 
the energy services segment focuses on providing wholesale energy services  including base load natural gas services  peaking services and balancing services  utilizing physical assets it controls  as well as natural gas management services to third parties 
njres contribution to earnings has increased over the past several years due primarily to increases in its portfolio of pipeline and storage capacity  the volatile nature of wholesale natural gas prices and higher management fees 
the volatile nature of wholesale natural gas prices over short periods of time can significantly impact njres revenue and gross margin 
furthermore  gross margin for njres is generally greater during the winter months  while the fixed costs of its capacity assets are generally spread throughout the year 
future growth is expected to come from opportunities that include the acquisition of additional storage and pipeline capacity assets and portfolio management services for third parties 
in the retail and other segment  njrhs is focused on growing its installation business and expanding its service contract customer base 
cr r seeks additional opportunities to enhance the value of its undeveloped land 
in the conduct of the company s business  management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on the company s future financial results 
njr s policy is to work with all stakeholders  including customers  regulators and policymakers  to achieve favorable results 
these factors include njng s regulation by the bpu and the rate of njng s customer growth in its service territory  which can be influenced by general economic conditions as well as political and regulatory policies that may impact the new housing market 
a portion of njng s customer growth comes from the conversion market  which is influenced by the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels  interest rates and other economic conditions 
while the impact of weather on njng s gross margin has been significantly mitigated due to the wnc  significant variations from normal weather  as well as increased commodity prices  both of which affect customer usage patterns  can impact njng s gross margin 
njng s operating expenses are heavily influenced by labor costs  large components of which are covered by a recently negotiated collective bargaining agreement that expires in labor related fringe benefit costs  which are also subject to numerous factors  may also influence the company s results 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued due to the capital intensive nature of njng s operations and the seasonal nature of njr s working capital requirements  significant changes in interest rates can also impact njr s results 
critical accounting policies management believes that it exercises good judgment in selecting and applying accounting principles 
the consolidated financial statements of njr include estimates  and actual results in the future may differ from such estimates 
njr s critical accounting policies are described below 
regulatory assets and liabilities njr s largest subsidiary  njng  maintains its accounts in accordance with the uniform system of accounts as prescribed by the bpu 
as a result of the ratemaking process  njng is required to follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  and consequently  the accounting principles applied by njng differ in certain respects from those applied by unregulated businesses 
njng is required under sfas to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements 
njng s basic gas supply service bgss requires njng to project its natural gas costs and provides the ability  subject to bpu approval  to recover or refund the difference  if any  of such actual costs as compared with the projected costs included in prices through a bgss charge to customers 
any underrecovery or overrecovery is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflected in the bgss in subsequent years 
njng also enters into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases  and the offset to the resulting fair value of derivative assets or liabilities is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the bgss  other regulatory assets consist primarily of remediation costs associated with mgp sites  which are discussed below under environmental costs  the wnc and the new jersey clean energy program  which are also subject to bpu approval 
if there are changes in future regulatory positions that indicate the recovery of such regulatory assets is not probable  the related cost and carrying costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination 
derivatives derivative activities are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  under which njr records the fair value of derivatives held as assets and liabilities 
njr s unregulated subsidiaries record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of common stock equity 
under sfas  njr also has certain derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges 
the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in gas purchases on the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  the changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting are recorded as increases or decreases in natural gas costs or interest expense  as applicable  based on the nature of the derivatives 
njng s derivatives that are used to hedge its natural gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its bgss  subject to bpu approval 
accordingly  the offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued consolidated balance sheets 
njr has not designated any derivatives as fair value hedges as of september  and the fair value of derivative investments is determined by reference to quoted market prices of listed contracts  published quotations or quotations from independent parties 
in providing its unregulated wholesale energy services  njres enters into physical contracts to buy and sell natural gas 
these contracts qualify as normal purchases and sales under sfas in that they provide for the purchase or sale of natural gas that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by njres over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  njres accounts for these contracts under settlement accounting 
environmental costs at the end of each fiscal year  njng updates the environmental review of its mgp sites  including a review of its potential liability for investigation and remedial action  based on assistance from an outside consulting firm 
from this review  njng estimates expenditures to remediate and monitor these mgp sites  exclusive of any insurance recoveries 
njng s estimate of these liabilities is developed from then currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
where available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the liability  it is njng s policy to accrue the full amount of such estimate 
where the information is sufficient to establish only a range of probable liability  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  it is njng s policy to accrue the lower end of the range 
since management believes that recovery of these expenditures  as well as related litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  in accordance with sfas  it has recorded a regulatory asset corresponding to the accrued liability 
the actual costs to be incurred by njng are dependent upon several factors  including final determination of remedial action  changing technologies and governmental regulations  the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay  the impact of litigation and any insurance recoveries 
if there are changes in future regulatory positions that indicate the recovery of all or a portion of such regulatory asset is not probable  the related cost and carrying costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination 
as of september   million of previously incurred remediation costs  net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received and anticipated  are included in regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
also included in regulatory assets at september   are million of accrued future remediation costs 
unbilled revenue revenues related to the sale of natural gas are generally recorded when natural gas is delivered to customers 
however  determining natural gas sales to individual customers is based on actual or estimated meter reading  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of natural gas delivered to customers since the date of the last meter read are estimated  and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded 
this unbilled revenue is estimated new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued each month based on natural gas delivered monthly into the system  unaccounted for natural gas based on historical results and applicable customer rates 
postretirement employee benefits njr s costs of providing postretirement employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
postretirement employee benefit costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compen sation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans and the return on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future postretirement employee benefit costs 
postretirement employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligations pbo 
in determining the pbo and cost amounts  assumptions can change from period to period  which could result in material changes to net postretirement employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized by njr 
njr s postretirement employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of us equity securities  international equity securities and fixed income investments  with a targeted allocation of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
fluctuations in actual market returns  as well as changes in interest rates  may result in increased or decreased postretirement employee benefit costs in future periods 
postretirement employee benefit expenses are included in operations maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the following is a summary of a sensitivity analysis for each actuarial assumption 
pension plans actuarial assumptions current increase estimated decrease on pbo thousands estimated decrease to expense thousands discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a other postretirement benefits actuarial assumptions current increase estimated decrease on pbo thousands estimated decrease to expense thousands discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new accounting policies the company did not change any of its existing accounting policies in fiscal the company has discussed new accounting standards and their impact or potential impact in note summary of significant accounting policies new accounting standards 
results of operations consolidated net income increased percent to million in fiscal  percent to million in fiscal and percent to million in fiscal the fiscal results of per basic share and per diluted share include a gain of 
per share on the sale of a commercial office building  a charge of 
per basic share associated with an early retirement program for officers and a charge of

net of these items  njr s earnings in fiscal were million  or per basic share and per diluted share 
dividends declared per share increased percent to in fiscal  percent to in fiscal and percent to in fiscal following is a reconciliation of as reported and as adjusted information for net income and basic and diluted earnings per share 
this reconciliation reflects the impact of the gain on sale of the commercial office building  the charge related to an early retirement program for officers and the charge for the impairment of certain undeveloped land 
management believes that this reconciliation is needed due to the unusual nature of these items and that they are not indicative of core results 
it also provides a more consistent comparison for year over year results 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued unaudited thousands  except per share data for twelve months ended september  njng njres njrhs and other total net income  as reported exclude gain on sale of commercial office building  net of tax charge for early retirement program  net of tax charge for impairment of undeveloped land  net of tax net income  as adjusted earnings per share basic  as reported exclude gain on sale of commercial office building  net of tax charge for early retirement program  net of tax charge for impairment of undeveloped land  net of tax earnings per share basic  as adjusted earnings per share diluted  as reported exclude gain on sale of commercial office building  net of tax charge for early retirement program  net of tax charge for impairment of undeveloped land  net of tax earnings per share diluted  as adjusted amount does not foot due to rounding natural gas distribution operations njng is a local natural gas distribution company that provides regulated retail energy services to more than  residential and commercial customers in central and northern new jersey and participates in the off system sales and capacity release markets 
njng s goal is to manage its growth without filing traditional base rate cases in order to provide competitive prices to its customers 
in february  the electric discount and energy competition act edeca  which provides the framework for the restructuring of new jersey s energy markets  became law 
in march  the bpu issued an order to fully open njng s residential markets to competition  restructure its rates to segregate its bgss and delivery ie  transportation service prices as required by edeca and expand an incentive for residential and small commercial customers to switch to transportation service 
njng earns no gross margin on the commodity portion of its natural gas sales 
njng earns gross margin through the delivery of natural gas to its customers 
in january  the bpu ordered that bgss could be provided by suppliers other than the state s natural gas utilities  but bgss should be provided by the state s natural gas utilities until further bpu action 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued njng s financial results are summarized as follows thousands revenue gross margin residential and commercial transportation total firm gross margin incentive programs interruptible total gross margin operation and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization other taxes not reflected in gross margin operating income other income interest charges  net net income gross margin njng s gross margin is defined as natural gas revenues less natural gas purchases  sales tax  a transitional energy facilities assessment tefa  which is included in energy and other taxes on the consolidated statements of income  and regulatory rider expenses 
regulatory rider expenses consist of recovery of state mandated programs and the remediation adjustment clause costs 
these expenses are designed to be primarily offset by corresponding revenues 
management believes that gross margin provides a more meaningful basis than revenue for evaluating utility operations since natural gas costs  sales tax  tefa and regulatory rider expenses are passed through to customers and  therefore  have no effect on gross margin 
natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices in njng s bgss tariff  approved by the bpu 
the bgss price includes projected natural gas costs  net of supplier refunds  the impact of hedging activities and credits from non firm sales and transportation activities 
any underrecoveries or overrecoveries from the projected amounts are deferred and reflected in the bgss in subsequent periods 
sales tax is calculated at percent of revenue and excludes sales to cogeneration facilities  other utilities  off system sales and federal accounts 
tefa is calculated on a per therm basis and excludes sales to cogeneration facilities  other utilities and off system sales 
regulatory rider expenses are calculated on a per therm basis 
njng s operating revenues increased percent to billion and percent to million in fiscal and  respectively 
gas purchases increased percent to million and percent to million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in operating revenues and gas purchases in fiscal and were the result of higher prices due primarily to the increase in wholesale commodity costs 
sales tax and tefa  which are presented gross in the consolidated statements of income  totaled million  million and million in fiscal new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  and  respectively 
the increase in sales tax and tefa is due primarily to higher sales tax associated with the increase in revenues 
regulatory rider expenses totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in regulatory rider expenses is due primarily to higher rates associated with the remediation and clean energy riders 
firm gross margin gross margin from residential and commercial customers is impacted by the wnc  which provides for a revenue adjustment if the weather varies by more than one half percent from normal weather ie  year average 
on october   the bpu approved njng s request to update factors used in the wnc 
several components of the calculation had not been adjusted to reflect njng s growth since the conclusion of njng s last traditional base rate case in january updating the consumption factors has made the resulting calculations from the wnc more effective in mitigating the impact of weather 
the accumulated adjustment from one heating season ie  october through may is billed or credited to customers in subsequent periods 
this mechanism reduces the variability of both customers bills and njng s earnings due to weather fluctuations 
the wnc does not  however  reflect reductions in customer usage from the assumed level in the wnc 
customers switching between sales service and transportation service affect the components of gross margin from firm customers 
njng s total gross margin is not negatively affected by customers who use its transportation service and purchase natural gas from another supplier because its tariff is designed so that no profit is earned on the commodity portion of sales to firm customers 
all customers who purchase natural gas from another supplier continue to use njng for transportation service 
total firm gross margin decreased million  or less than percent  and million  or less than percent  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in usage per degree day 
management believes that the lower usage per degree day was due primarily to the impact of higher wholesale natural gas prices and inconsistent weather patterns 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the percent warmer weather  compared with fiscal  which was partially offset by continued customer growth 
njng added  and  new customers and added natural gas heat and other services to another and  existing customers in fiscal and  respectively 
this customer growth represents an estimated annual increase of approximately billion cubic feet bcf in sales to firm customers  assuming normal weather and usage 
the weather in fiscal was percent colder than normal  therefore njng deferred million of gross margin for future refunds to customers under the wnc 
on september   njng filed a request to apply the value of this wnc balance to other sbc clauses 
the weather in fiscal was percent warmer than normal  which resulted in no deferral or accrual of gross margin 
in accordance with a bpu order  njng applied a million cumulative wnc credit to other clauses that were in an underrecovered position 
the weather in fiscal was percent colder than normal  which  in accordance with the wnc  resulted in the deferral of million of gross margin  which was credited to njng s customers 
njng estimates that the colder new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued weather in fiscal resulted in approximately million of additional gross margin beyond the amount captured in the wnc 
gross margin from sales to residential and commercial customers increased  or less than one percent  and increased million  or percent  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales to residential and commercial customers were bcf in fiscal  compared with bcf in fiscal  and bcf in fiscal the relatively stable gross margin was due primarily to the lower usage per degree day  discussed above  which offset customer growth 
gross margin from transportation service decreased million  or percent  and million  or percent  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
njng transported bcf for its firm customers in fiscal  compared with bcf in fiscal and bcf in fiscal the decreases were due primarily to a reduction in customers utilizing the transportation service and the lower usage per degree day discussed above 
njng had  and  residential customers and  and  commercial customers using its transportation service at september  and  respectively 
the decrease in transportation customers was due primarily to a decline in third party marketing efforts in njng s service territory 
in fiscal and  njng currently expects to add approximately  new customers each year and convert an additional existing customers each year to natural gas heat and other services 
achieving these expectations would represent an estimated annual customer growth rate of approximately percent and result in an estimated sales increase of approximately bcf annually  assuming normal weather and average usage 
it is believed that this growth would increase gross margin under present base rates by approximately million annually 
these growth expectations are based upon management s review of local planning board data  recent market research performed by third parties  builder surveys and studies of population growth rates in njng s service territory 
however  future sales will be affected by the weather  actual energy usage patterns of njng s customers  economic conditions in njng s service territory  conversion and conservation activity  the impact of changing from a regulated to a competitive environment  changes in state regulation and other marketing efforts  as has been the case in prior years 
incentive programs to reduce the overall cost of its natural gas supply commitments  njng has entered into contracts to sell natural gas to wholesale customers outside its franchise territory when the natural gas is not needed for system requirements 
these off system sales enable njng to spread its fixed demand costs  which are charged by pipelines to access their supplies year round  over a larger and more diverse customer base 
njng also participates in the capacity release market on the interstate pipeline network when the capacity is not needed for its firm system requirements 
on october   the bpu approved the extension of an incentive related to these programs through october   whereby njng retains percent of the gross margin from these sales  with percent credited to firm customers through the bgss 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the financial risk management frm program is designed to provide price stability to njng s natural gas supply portfolio 
the frm program includes an incentive mechanism designed to encourage the use of financial instruments to hedge njng s natural gas costs  with an percent sharing of the costs and results between customers and shareowners  respectively 
on october   this program was extended through october  the bpu also approved  on october   a pilot for a storage incentive program that shares gains and losses on an percent basis between customers and shareowners  respectively 
this program  which was subject to review after one year of operation  measures the difference between the actual cost of natural gas in storage and a benchmark applicable to the april through october injection season 
the results of the first year of the storage incentive were reviewed with the bpu in january  and no modifications were made to the program 
njng s june   bgss filing requested an additional one year extension to the current bgss related incentive program 
njng s incentive programs totaled bcf and generated million of gross margin in fiscal  compared with bcf and million of gross margin in fiscal and bcf and million of gross margin in fiscal the increases in gross margin in fiscal and  were primarily due to the successful optimization of the storage incentive program and increased off system sales resulting from the strategic management of the existing supply portfolio  while considering customer supply obligations 
interruptible njng serves customers through interruptible sales and or transportation tariffs 
sales made under the interruptible sales tariff are priced on market sensitive energy parity rates 
although therms sold and transported to interruptible customers represented approximately percent of total throughput in fiscal and and percent of the total throughput in both fiscal and  they accounted for less than percent of the total gross margin in each year due to the sharing formulas that govern these sales 
under these formulas  njng retains percent of the gross margin from interruptible sales and percent of the gross margin from transportation sales  with percent and percent  respectively  credited to firm sales customers through the bgss 
interruptible sales were bcf  bcf  and bcf in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  njng transported bcf  bcf and bcf in fiscal  and  respectively  for its interruptible customers 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance o m expense decreased  or percent  fiscal  compared with last year 
the decrease was due primarily to lower costs associated with incentive compensation plans and lower allocations from njr service corporation  which more than offset njng s share of the early retirement charge 
o m expense decreased million  or percent  in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due primarily to lower allocation of expenses from affiliated companies as a result of revised allocation factors and lower fringe benefit and advertising costs 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating income operating income decreased million  or percent  in fiscal  compared with last year  due primarily to the lower gross margin described above and higher depreciation expense offset by lower o m expense  as described above 
operating income increased million  or percent  in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to the lower o m expense described above 
net income net income decreased million  or percent  in fiscal due primarily to lower operating income discussed above  lower other income due to reduced interest income associated with various regulatory riders and higher interest expense due to higher short term interest rates 
net income increased million  or percent  in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due primarily to the higher operating income discussed above and higher other income 
the increase in other income was due primarily to higher interest income associated with various regulatory riders  which more than offset increased interest expense due to higher average long term debt outstanding 
energy services operations njres financial results are summarized as follows thousands operating revenues gas purchases gross margin operation and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization other taxes operating income net income njres operating revenues increased million  or percent  in fiscal compared with last year due primarily to higher natural gas prices 
njres revenues decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due to the inclusion in fiscal revenue of a relatively large volume  low margin transportation contract  which expired in march natural gas sold and managed by njres totaled bcf in fiscal  compared with bcf in fiscal and bcf in fiscal njres gross margin is defined as natural gas revenues and management fees less natural gas costs and fixed demand costs 
njres gross margin increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to favorable time spreads on storage asset positions  as well as to favorable locational spreads on transportation capacity 
njres net income million increased in fiscal  primarily due to the increase in gross margin described above 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued njres gross margin increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to sales generated from its portfolio of storage and transportation capacity contracts  as well as higher management fees associated with njres management of other companies storage  transportation and fuel contracts 
njres net income increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due primarily to the higher gross margin  which more than offset increased o m expenses related to higher allocation expenses from affiliated companies  as a result of revised allocation factors  and higher labor and legal expenses 
future results are subject to njres ability to maintain and expand its wholesale marketing activities and are contingent upon many other factors  including an adequate number of appropriate counterparties  sufficient liquidity in the energy trading market and continued access to the capital markets 
retail and other operations the financial results of retail and other consists primarily of njrhs  which provides service  sales and installation of appliances to over  customers  cr r  which holds and develops commercial real estate  and njr energy  which consists primarily of equity investments in capstone turbine corporation  and the iroquois gas transmission system  lp iroquois 
the consolidated financial results of retail and other are summarized as follows thousands operating revenues other income net income retail and other earnings for the fiscal year increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due primarily to the million after tax gain on the sale of the commercial office building  partially offset by the million after tax loss on the impairment of acres of undeveloped land 
net of these items and this segment s portion of the early retirement charge  earnings for fiscal increased to million  compared with million last year 
net income increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  due to improved results in the appliance service business at njrhs and higher results at iroquois 
other income includes the amortization of a gain related to the sale leaseback of a building  discussed below  and earnings generated from njr energy s equity investment in iroquois 
in fiscal  cr r entered into a sale leaseback transaction that generated a pre tax gain of million  which is included in deferred revenue and is being amortized to other income over the year term of the lease 
the primary tenant of the facility  njng  is leasing the building under a long term master lease agreement approved by the bpu and continues to occupy a majority of the space in the building 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources consolidated njr s objective is to maintain a consolidated capital structure that reflects the different characteristics of each business segment and provides adequate financial flexibility for accessing capital markets as required 
njr s consolidated capital structure at september was as follows common stock equity long term debt short term debt total njr satisfies its external common equity requirements  if any  through issuances of its common stock  including the proceeds from stock issuances under its automatic dividend reinvestment plan drp and proceeds from the exercise of options issued under the company s long term incentive program 
the drp allows njr  at its option  to use shares purchased on the open market or newly issued shares 
the company currently has a million share repurchase plan 
as of september   the company had repurchased million shares of its common stock under this plan 
the decrease in short term debt at september   was due primarily to improved cash flow from operations 
in december  njr entered into a million committed credit facility with several banks  which replaced a million credit facility 
this facility has a year term  expiring in december in november  njr amended the facility to increase it to million 
in november  njr entered into a year million committed credit facility with a bank 
these facilities provide liquidity to meet working capital and external debt financing requirements of njr and its nonregulated companies 
neither njng nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support the njr facilities 
in december  njng entered into a million committed credit facility with several banks  with a year term  expiring in december which replaced a million committed credit facility with a shorter term 
this facility is used to support njng s commercial paper program 
in november  njng amended this facility to increase it to million 
njng satisfies its debt needs by issuing short and long term debt based upon its own financial profile 
njng does not guarantee or otherwise directly support the debt of njr 
the seasonal nature of njng s operations creates large short term cash requirements  primarily to finance natural gas purchases and customer accounts receivable 
njng obtains working capital for these requirements  new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and for the temporary financing of construction and mgp remediation expenditures and energy tax payments  through the issuance of commercial paper and short term bank loans 
to support the issuance of commercial paper  njng maintains the committed credit facility  discussed earlier  totaling million 
njr had borrowings of million and million at september  and  respectively  under its committed credit facilities to fund the debt requirements of its nonregulated subsidiaries and its working capital and investment activity 
njng had zero and million of commercial paper borrowings supported by njng s committed credit facilities at september  and  respectively 
financial covenants contained in njr s credit facility include a maximum debt to total capitalization of percent and minimum interest coverage of times 
at september   the debt to total capitalization was percent  and for the year ended september   the interest coverage was times

as of september   there were njr guarantees covering approximately million of natural gas purchases and demand fee commitments of njres and njng  included in natural gas supply purchase obligations above  not yet reflected in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
njng issued a million letter of credit  which will expire in december  in conjunction with a long term swap agreement 
the long term swap agreement was entered into as a hedge related to an offsetting physical purchase for the same time period and volume 
this letter of credit new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued reduces the amount available under njng s committed credit facility by the same amount 
njng does not anticipate that this letter of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparty 
the company made a million tax deductible contribution to its pension plans during fiscal the company is not currently required to make minimum pension funding contributions during fiscal if market performance is less than anticipated  additional funding may be required 
in fiscal   of tax deductible contributions were made to the other postretirement benefit opeb plans 
the company s funding level to its opeb plans is expected to be approximately  annually over the next five years 
additional contributions to the pension and opeb plans may be made based on market conditions and various assumptions 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
cash flows operating activities cash flow from operating activities totaled million in fiscal  compared with cash flow used in operations of million in fiscal and cash flow from operations of million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to higher net income and improved working capital 
the improvement in working capital was due primarily to the reduction in broker margin requirements and underrecovered gas costs  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to the increase in working capital requirements associated with the increase in wholesale natural gas prices and volumes of natural gas in storage  which caused higher natural gas inventory balances  additional margin requirements associated with njres hedging activity and increased receivable balances 
these additional working capital requirements more than offset higher net income and depreciation 
njng s mgp expenditures  exclusive of insurance recoveries  are currently expected to total million in see note commitments and contingent liabilities 
financing activities cash flow used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared with cash flows from financing activities of million in fiscal and cash flows used in financing activities of million in fiscal the change in fiscal was due primarily to the payment of long term debt  higher share repurchases and reduction in short term debt 
the change in fiscal was due primarily to the issuance of both long and short term debt of million 
the increase in short term debt in fiscal was due primarily to the working capital requirements associated with higher wholesale natural gas prices discussed above 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in march  njng issued million of unsecured senior notes with a year maturity and percent interest rate and njr issued million of unsecured senior notes with a year maturity and percent interest rate
