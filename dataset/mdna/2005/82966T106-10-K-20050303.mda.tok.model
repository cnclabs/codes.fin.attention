item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  and in particular under the heading business outlook below  and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  potential  or continue  the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including those described above under risk factors 
we begin md a with a discussion of sirenza s overall strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving  followed by an overview of the critical factors that affect our net revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe require the most significant judgments to be made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in the next section we discuss the results of our operations for compared to and for compared to we then provide an analysis of our cash flows  including the impact on cash of important balance sheet changes  and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations 
we conclude this md a with our business outlook section  discussing our outlook for company overview we are a leading designer and an iso and iso certified supplier of high performance rf components for the commercial communications and a d equipment markets 
our products are designed to optimize the reception and transmission of voice and data signals in mobile wireless communications networks and in other wireless and wireline applications 
our commercial communications applications include components for mobile wireless infrastructure applications  wireless lans  fixed wireless networks  broadband wireline applications such as coaxial cable and fiber optic networks  cable television set top boxes  rfid readers and wireless video transmitters 
as a result of our acquisition of isg in december  we have expanded our products and end markets to include antennae and receivers for satellite radio  as well as tuner ics and transceivers for hdtv set top boxes 
sales of components for the a d end markets include components for government  military  avionics  space and homeland security systems 
we believe a fundamental value we provide to our commercial and a d customers is derived from our focus on the needs of infrastructure applications  our wide array of highly engineered products in multiple technologies  and our commitment to support our customers worldwide with sales and application engineering support 

table of contents we offer a broad line of products that range in complexity from discrete components to ics and mcms 
our discrete  ic and mcm products employ a broad array of semiconductor process technologies  which we believe allows us to optimize our products for our customers applications 
a significant downturn affected our end markets beginning in although our net revenues were significantly impacted by this downturn in  our net revenues have increased in each of  and  driven by new product introductions  increased market share and the addition of complementary products through our strategic acquisitions of other companies and assets 
we have made three acquisitions since on december   we acquired isg  a designer of rf gateway module and ic products for the cable tv  satellite radio and hdtv markets 
this acquisition enables us to address new end markets  including hdtv and satellite radio  and broadens our product offering in the set top box market by adding isg s silicon based receiver tuner products to our existing product lines targeting this market 
we have had limited sales of these products to date 
on may   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed specified liabilities of vari l company  inc  a designer and manufacturer of vcos  plls and other mcm products for the mobile wireless infrastructure market  as well as certain components for the a d market 
this acquisition strengthened our product portfolio by adding rf signal source components while strengthening our presence in the a d markets 
the acquisition of vari l added a significant amount of net revenues to sirenza subsequent to the date of the transaction 
we intend to constitute a d as a separate division and report it as a separate business segment beginning in on september   we acquired xemod incorporated  a designer and fabless manufacturer of rf power amplifier modules and components based on patented ldmos technology 
the acquisition strengthened our product portfolio of rf components by adding high power amplifier module products 
we have not had significant sales of these products to date 
after the acquisition of vari l  we relocated our corporate headquarters and consolidated our manufacturing facilities in broomfield  colorado  which allowed us to achieve significant operational cost synergies  primarily in operations  general and administrative and  to a more limited degree  in sales and marketing 
the achievement of these operational cost synergies in combination with a significant increase in our net revenues subsequent to the vari l transaction was the primary factor that caused a decrease in the ratio of our operating expenses ie  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative to our net revenues from in to approximately in if we had not achieved these cost synergies  our cost of revenues  general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses would have been higher  both in terms of dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for historically we have utilized a divisional organization structure focused on either specific end markets and or product types 
we currently operate in two  product focused divisions  or business segments our amplifier division and our signal source division 
the two divisions are generally focused on similar end markets and customers and are managed separately in order to better manage the research and development and marketing efforts for particular products 
the amplifier division s main product lines are primarily ic based and include discrete  amplifier  low noise amplifier lna and power amplifier ic products  transceiver ic products and an mcm product line including power amplifier modules 
the signal source division s primary product lines are mcms used in wireless infrastructure applications to generate and 
table of contents control rf signals  including vcos  plls  cros  passive and active mixers  an ic based modulator and demodulator product line and a line of signal couplers 
the majority of our current a d sales is credited to the signal source division and consists of sales of government and military specified versions of our vcos and various passive components 
for a further description of our divisional organizational structure  see our disclosure under note segments of an enterprise and related information in our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth below 
revenue overview we present our revenue results as net revenues 
net revenues are defined as our revenues less sales discounts  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments 
historically  these revenue related adjustments have not represented a significant percentage of our revenues 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales channel and a distribution sales channel 
we recognize revenues on sales to our distributors under agreements providing for rights of return and pricing discount programs  at the time our products are sold by the distributors to third party customers 
our distribution channel  which accounted for of total net revenues for  consists of those sales made by our four distribution channel partners avnet  acal  nu horizons  and rfmw under such agreements that provide for rights of return and pricing discounts 
sales to avnet and acal as resellers  and to other resellers of our products  are not contracted under agreements that provide for rights of return and pricing discounts 
we recognize revenue from sales to these resellers of our products  and from sales to all other non distribution customers  at the time product has shipped  title has transferred and no obligations remain 
our direct sales channel  which accounted for of total net revenues for  consists of those sales made to all non distributor customers and resellers of our products  including sales to avnet and acal as resellers 
for further detail on our revenue recognition  please see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies in our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth below 
although we have typically not experienced a delay in customer acceptance of our products  should a customer delay acceptance in the future  our policy is to delay revenue recognition until a customer accepts the products 
historically  a significant percentage of our net revenues has been derived from a limited number of customers  including our distributors 
from to  our customer base shifted significantly as a result of our focus on strengthening our direct sales channel 
our sales and marketing efforts contributed to a majority of our and net revenues being derived from a specific set of large wireless infrastructure oems including andrew  ericsson  lucent and their contract manufacturers 
this trend was strengthened in by the acquisition of vari l whose customers were also large infrastructure oems  including nokia  siemens and motorola 
we believe that these and other global oems and their cms will continue to account for a majority of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
we have grown our net revenues through the introduction of new products  increasing our market share and adding complementary products through strategic acquisitions 
our strategy is to continue to grow our net revenues by the same means 
in addition to these strategies  we continue to focus on growing sales to customers in other wireless  wireline and a d end markets  through both our direct and distribution channels 
our sales have also shifted in their geographic location 
from through we broadened our geographic reach so that as we exited  our net revenues were evenly split between asia  north america and europe 
sales into asia increased during as a result of oems increasingly outsourcing their manufacturing to contract manufacturers  primarily in china 
as a result of the increase in shipments to our oems contract manufacturers  we anticipate that a higher percentage of our sales will be in the asia region 

table of contents since  we have had essentially the same group of competitors 
with respect to products sold in our amplifier division  we compete primarily with other suppliers of high performance rf components used in communications infrastructure equipment  such as agilent  m a com  nec and wj communications 
for our products gained through the acquisition of isg  we expect our most significant competitors will include maxim integrated products  microtune  motorola and philips 
with respect to our signal source division products  our primary competitors are alps  m a com and minicircuits 
we also compete with communications equipment manufacturers  some of whom are our customers  that design rf components internally  such as ericsson  lucent  motorola  nokia and nortel networks 
since  our oem customers have been increasingly outsourcing the manufacturing of their equipment to cms  including celestica  flextronics  sanmina and solectron 
as a result  we sell directly to both oems and cms 
currently  our oem customers make the sourcing decisions for our sales to cms 
when we report customer net revenues in our public announcements  we attribute all net revenues to the ultimate oem customer and not the respective cms 
cost of revenues overview cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with wafers from third party wafer fabs for our ic products  raw material components from third party vendors  for both our ic and mcm products  packaging for our ic products performed by third party vendors  assembling and testing of our mcm products in our facility  testing of our ic products in our facility  and costs associated with procurement  production control  quality assurance  reliability and manufacturing engineering 
for our ic products  we outsource our wafer manufacturing and packaging and then perform a significant majority of our final testing and tape and reel assembly at our colorado manufacturing facility 
for our mcms  we manufacture  assemble and test most of our products at our manufacturing facility in colorado 
historically  we have relied upon a limited number of foundries to manufacture most of our semiconductor wafers for our ic products 
we have contractual agreements with most  but not all  of these suppliers in which pricing is established based on volume  and in which price  volume and other terms are reset on a periodic basis through negotiations between the parties based on current market conditions 
we source our ic packaging assembly from a limited number of established  international commercial vendors 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on a limited number of vendors for our wafer and packaging requirements 
generally  raw materials utilized by us for our mcm products are readily available from numerous sources 
these vendors are competitive and we expect that to the extent our volumes increase  we may be able to reduce costs by obtaining better volume pricing and delivery terms 

table of contents we currently outsource a portion of our manufacturing and testing function  and may increasingly do so where economically viable for both the vendor and us 
gross profit and margin overview our gross profit and gross margin percent can be influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to product features historically  customers have been willing to pay a premium for new or different features or functionality 
therefore  increased sales of such products in a given period are likely to have a positive effect on our gross margin percent 
product type in the markets in which we operate  ic products have historically yielded a higher gross margin percent than mcms 
therefore  increased sales of ic products in a given period will have a positive effect on our gross margin percent 
market our products are sold into a wide variety of markets and each of these markets has a pricing structure that is dictated by the economics of that particular market 
therefore  the gross margin percent on our products can vary by the markets into which they are sold 
therefore  increased sales into higher margin markets in a given period will have a positive effect on our gross margin percent 
sales channel historically  the gross margin percent on sales to our large oem customers has been lower than the gross margin percent on sales through our distribution channel or sales to some of our smaller direct customers 
this is primarily due to the bargaining power attendant to large oem customers based on their higher product volumes 
therefore  increased sales to our large oem customers in a given period may have a negative effect on our gross margin percent 
level of integration of the product our customers generally seek more integrated products with enhanced functionality  which enables them to procure fewer products from fewer suppliers 
these integrated products typically command a higher average selling price than our stand alone components 
however  the manufacturing costs of these integrated products are higher  which generally results in a lower gross margin percent on initial sales of our integrated products in comparison to our stand alone components 
therefore  increased sales of our more integrated products in a given period will generally have a positive impact on our average selling prices and a negative effect on our gross margin percent 
the efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing operations our gross margin percent is generally lower in periods with less volume and higher in periods with increased volume 
in periods in which volumes are low  our fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to fewer units  thereby negatively impacting our gross margin percent when those products are sold 
likewise  in periods in which volumes are high  our fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to more units  thereby positively impacting gross margin percent when those products are sold 

table of contents provision for excess inventories as discussed in more detail in critical accounting policies and estimates  our cost of revenues and gross margin percent may be negatively influenced by provisions for excess inventories and positively influenced by the sale of previously written down inventory 
these actions can have material impacts on cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percent 
we believe that each of the above factors will continue to affect our cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percentage for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the interaction of the factors listed above could have a significant period to period effect on our cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percent 
operating expense overview research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and salary related expenses for personnel engaged in r d activities  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and  to a lesser extent  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers 
we expense all of our r d costs as they are incurred 
our r d costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing and quantities of materials bought for prototype and test units 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to offer a broad range of highly engineered products designed to meet the needs of our customers 
our strategy is to continue to invest in r d at sufficient levels in order to maintain our competitive advantage 
we historically have performed our r d activities in multiple  geographically dispersed locations in north america 
we believe maintaining multiple r d design centers allows us to attract key personnel we might not otherwise be able to hire 
in addition  we believe that having stand alone r d centers allows the personnel there to better concentrate on their development tasks 
we plan to continue our strategy of conducting our r d activities in multiple locations 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and salary related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and application engineering functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows  promotional activities  advertising and public relations 
we record as an expense commissions to our external  independent sales representatives when revenues from the associated sale are recognized 
we record as an expense quarterly commissions to internal sales employees based on the achievement of targeted net revenue and sales related goals 
the nature of our sales and marketing expenditures has changed significantly over time 
starting in we invested in increasing the number of direct sales personnel and application engineers supporting our customers 
in particular  to support our customers  we placed both sales personnel and application engineers in various time zones around the world 
we believe that our direct sales force and application engineers provide us with a key competitive advantage in our markets 
we intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing functions in order to sustain our advantage in this area 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and salary related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resources personnel  as well as insurance and professional fees 
we intend to increase our general and administrative expenses as the need arises 

table of contents in process research and development ipr d consists of projects undertaken by isg that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition of isg and for which no alternative future use exists 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was determined using the income approach 
the income approach estimates costs to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the purchased ipr d were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by isg 
the million of ipr d charged to our results of operations in the fourth quarter of resulting from sirenza s acquisition of isg consisted of three projects using sige bicmos technology as follows an hdtv tuner ic project  an ic low power hdtv ic  and a satellite radio transceiver ic project 
the development of these projects remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts required to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially feasible products consists principally of planning  designing  experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on hdtv and satellite radio markets 
the following table summarizes key assumptions and the underlying valuations for the three ipr d projects described above related to sirenza s acquisition of isg hdtv ic low power hdtv ic satellite radio ic estimated fair value estimated of completion estimated cost to complete estimated completion date risk adjusted discount rate estimated revenue commencement year the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue and expense projections assuming the products have entered the market at a certain time  and discount rates based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management believes the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  in particular the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors  and of the valuation of long lived assets including acquisition related intangible assets 
however  we do not believe these policies currently meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
non marketable equity securities in  we acquired million shares of gcs  a privately held semiconductor foundry 
the acquired shares represented of the shares outstanding at the time 
the investment strengthened our supply chain for ingap semiconductor technologies 
in connection with the investment  our president and ceo joined the seven member gcs board of directors 
we regularly evaluate our investment in gcs to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
factors that may cause an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in gcs would include  but not be limited to  a degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operates  the failure of gcs to achieve certain performance milestones  financial performance below that anticipated in gcs current annual business plan  the inability of gcs to continue as a going concern or a reduced valuation as determined by a new financing event 
evaluating each of these factors involves a significant amount of judgment on management s part 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline in value has occurred  we will write down our investment in gcs to fair value 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
for example  in the fourth quarters of and  we wrote down the value of our investment in gcs by million and million  respectively  after determining that gcs value had experienced an other than temporary decline 
the ultimate realization of our investment in gcs will be dependent on the occurrence of a liquidity event for gcs  and or our ability to sell our gcs shares  for which there is no public market 
the likelihood of any of these events occurring will depend on  among other things  the market conditions surrounding the wireless communications industry and the related semiconductor foundry industry  as well as the public markets receptivity to liquidity events such as initial public offerings or mergers and acquisition activities 
for a further description of the events that resulted in our fourth quarter of impairment of our investment in gcs  see our disclosure under comparisons of to and to in our md a set forth below 
valuation of goodwill goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual review in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to that reporting unit 
our fair value methodology consists of a forecasted discounted cash flow model and a market value model 
the forecasted discounted cash flow model uses estimates of revenue for the business unit  based on estimates of market segment growth rates  estimated costs  and an estimated appropriate discount rate 
these estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates  various external market sources of information  and management s expectations of future trends 

table of contents our market value model considers our market capitalization and market multiples of revenue for comparable companies in our industry  as determined by management 
this information is derived from publicly available sources 
all of these estimates  including the selection of comparable publicly traded companies  involve a significant amount of judgment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
our expectations are that the most important factor in our estimation will be our ability to accurately forecast the demand for our products 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the third quarter of we concluded that we did not have any impairment of goodwill based on our forecasted discounted cash flows  our market capitalization and market multiples of revenue of comparable companies in our industry 
excess and obsolete inventories our provision for excess inventories is based on levels of inventory exceeding the forecasted demand of such products within specific time horizons 
we forecast demand for specific products based on the number of products we expect to sell  with such assumptions dependent on our assessment of market conditions and current and expected orders from our customers  considering that orders are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
the estimation of future demand used in the valuation of inventory is the basis for our announced revenue outlook and our factory loading factors 
if forecasted demand decreases or if inventory levels increase disproportionately to forecasted demand  inventory write downs may be required 
likewise  if we ultimately sell inventories that were previously written down  we would reduce the previously recorded excess inventory provisions which would have a positive impact on our cost of revenues  gross margin percent and operating results 
in  in response to the cancellation of several key customer programs and an overall severe and sudden downturn in demand for telecommunications equipment and components  we recorded a provision for excess inventories of million 
we subsequently began selling some of these written down inventory products 
in  we sold previously written down inventory products with an original cost basis of approximately  as the cost basis for written down inventories is less than the original cost basis when such products are sold  cost of revenues associated with the sale will be lower  which results in a higher gross margin on that sale 
sales of previously written down inventories had a positive impact on our gross margin in of approximately one percentage point 
the following table illustrates the impact on cost of revenues of additions to written down inventories and sales of previously written down inventory products for historical sirenza amplifier division products and also provides a schedule of the activity of sirenza s written down inventories in thousands year ended december  additions to written down inventories charged to cost of revenues sales of written down inventories with no associated cost of revenues disposition of written down inventories via scrap and other written down inventories at end of period 
table of contents the single largest factor affecting the accuracy of our provisions for excess inventories will be the accuracy of our end customers forecasts 
affecting these forecasts will be demand for communications components in our market segments 
also impacting it will be the speed at which our products are designed in or out of our customers products 
we will ultimately dispose of written down inventories by either selling such products or scrapping them 
we currently expect sales of written down inventory products in to be lower than in similarly  we anticipate that we will scrap additional written down inventories in the near term 
deferred tax assets we perform quarterly and annual assessments of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
as a result of these assessments  we previously concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the valuation allowance established in was recorded as a result of our analysis of the facts and circumstances at that time  which led us to conclude that we could no longer forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
in  we had taxable income in every quarter 
we continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance 
to the extent we continue to generate taxable income in and if our projections indicate that we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income  we may determine that some  or all  of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
in the quarter in which the valuation allowance is reduced  we may recognize a benefit from income taxes on our income statement

restructuring 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for a portion of one of our exited facilities 
we expect to receive net proceeds of  over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in june  from our sublessee 
accordingly  we reduced our accrued restructuring liability in the third quarter of by  this restructuring liability adjustment was recorded through the same statement of operations line item that was used when the liability was initially recorded  or restructuring 
in the second quarter of  as a result of the acquisition of vari l  the resulting new focus of sirenza and a new management structure  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  primarily related to a workforce reduction and costs of exiting excess facilities 
this restructuring plan was approved by management with the appropriate level of authority 
as part of the same process that led to the restructuring we decided to reoccupy a facility in sunnyvale  california  the costs of which had been included in our restructuring 
we determined that  of our restructuring liability accrual was no longer necessary as of june  we adjusted our restructuring liability accordingly 
the net restructuring charge in totaled  in the fourth quarter of  as a result of continued softness in the wireless telecommunications industry management of sirenza approved and committed to a restructuring plan including the termination of certain employees and exiting of excess facilities

impairment of investment in gcs 
during the fourth quarter of each of and we wrote down our investment in global communication semiconductors  inc gcs by approximately million and million  respectively 
these write downs resulted from our regular evaluations made to determine if factors have arisen that would indicate that an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of this investment has occurred 
the significant indicators we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the carrying value has occurred include  but are not limited to a degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operates  the failure of gcs to achieve certain performance milestones  financial performance below that anticipated in gcs current annual business plan  
table of contents the inability of gcs to continue as a going concern  or a reduced valuation as determined by a new financing event 
during there was a significant degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operated  as evidenced by the sharp decline in the economy in general and the telecommunications and semiconductor industry in particular 
the economic decline resulted in gcs experiencing a series of operating losses in excess of its then current business plan 
as a result of the foregoing  management concluded that we had incurred an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment 
management concluded  after considering alternative methodologies  and after applying an appropriate private company discount  to utilize a ratio of average stock price to net book value of comparable publicly traded companies to the book value of gcs 
management considered the methodology to be appropriate because as a semiconductor foundry  a large portion of gcs value could be identified in its fixed asset investments  the ratio of stock price to net book value moderated some of the non company specific valuation factors built into public stock prices during periods of high volatility  gcs was a going concern  and the methodology was clear and repeatable 
management continued to regularly evaluate its investment in gcs through the third quarter of and concluded no other than temporary decline in value had occurred 
in the fourth quarter of  management noted that there were indicators in the general business press regarding a degradation of the business environment for semiconductor companies and semiconductor foundries in particular 
our impression that gcs was operating in an increasingly challenging business environment was supported by a severe drop in the stock prices of comparable public companies in the second half of in addition  we noted that since the fourth quarter of  the book value of gcs continued to decline as a result of ongoing losses and the depreciation of their fixed assets 
while gcs achieved positive operating cash flow in the third quarter of  they returned to negative operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of offsetting these negative factors were the facts that gcs sales were increasing  its operating expenses were decreasing and that it had achieved several significant technical milestones 
after considering all of the above factors  management determined that our investment in gcs had experienced an other than temporary decline 
in determining a methodology for determining the value of our investment in gcs as of december   management concluded  after considering alternative methodologies  to use a combination of valuation techniques 
the first was to utilize a ratio of average stock price to net book value of comparable publicly traded companies 
in using this method  we once again applied an appropriate private company discount 
the second valuation methodology we used was a liquidation value 

table of contents management considered the following factors in determining that the combination valuation method was appropriate given its business prospects  technical capabilities and cash position  gcs was a going concern  as a semiconductor foundry  a large portion of gcs value could be identified in its fixed asset investments  the ratio of stock price to net book value of a portfolio of companies moderated some of the company specific valuation factors built into public stock prices during periods of high volatility  the methodology was clear and repeatable  gcs cash position had declined significantly from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  and gcs book value  which included its cash and net fixed assets  had declined significantly since the fourth quarter of the estimated fair value of our investment in gcs approximated million using the liquidation value and million using the price to book methodology 
management concluded that using the mid point of that range would be the most appropriate measure of estimated fair value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of to reduce the value of our investment in gcs to its estimated fair value  or million 
management reviewed with the audit committee and obtained the audit committee s approval of both management s conclusion about the other than temporary impairment of the value of our investment in gcs in the fourth quarter of and the valuation methodology used to determine the new fair value 
the ultimate realization of our investment in gcs will be dependent on the occurence of a liquidity event for gcs  and or our ability to sell our gcs shares  for which there is currently no public market 
the likelihood of any of these events occurring will depend on  among other things  market conditions surrounding the wireless communications industry and the related semiconductor foundry industry  as well as the public markets receptivity to liquidity events such as initial public offerings or merger and acquisition activities 
even if we are able to sell our gcs shares  the sale price may be less than the carrying value of the investment  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  includes income from our cash and available for sale securities  interest expense from capital lease financing obligations and other miscellaneous items 
we had net interest and other income of  in   in  and  in the decrease in net interest and other income in compared to and compared was primarily attributable to a reduction in our cash and available for sale securities 
provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a  tax provision in the income tax provision represents federal and state minimum taxes and income taxes on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the difference between the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the statutory rate to our income before income taxes and the provision actually recorded is due primarily to the impact of state and foreign taxes including other miscellaneous non deductible items offset by the utilization of federal net operating losses 
we recorded a  benefit from income taxes in the income tax benefit resulted from a reversal of  of previously accrued canadian income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the closeout of prior year canadian income tax audits and the evaluation by management of future canadian income tax reserve requirements 
the difference between the benefit from income taxes that 
table of contents would be derived by applying the statutory rate to our loss before income taxes and the benefit actually recorded is due primarily to an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  nondeductible amortization of stock based compensation and the net effect of the foreign income taxes incurred in taxable jurisdictions in which we operated offset by the reversal of previously accrued canadian income taxes 
we recorded a  provision for foreign income taxes in the difference between our provision for income taxes in and the tax benefit that would be derived from applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before taxes is primarily due to foreign income taxes  an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  non deductible amortization of deferred stock compensation and a non deductible in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of xemod 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we have evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   we had no ability to realize our deferred tax assets through carrybacks or available tax planning strategies 
additionally  based on cumulative pre tax losses we have sustained in the three years ended december  and the current economic uncertainty in our industry that limits our ability to generate verifiable forecasts of future domestic taxable income  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our deferred tax assets was recorded as of december  the valuation allowance decreased by approximately million in and increased by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in the valuation allowance for the period ended december  was primarily due to the company re evaluating acquisition related tax attributes and determining that these attributes would not be available for use in future periods 
as a result  the valuation allowance attributable to acquisition related items was reduced to million for the period ended december  from million for the period ended december  the remaining million valuation allowance attributable to acquisition related items  if and to the extent realized in future periods  will first reduce the carrying value of goodwill  next reduce the carrying value of other long lived intangible assets of our acquired subsidiary and lastly reduce income tax expense 
approximately million of our valuation allowance was attributable to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to additional paid in capital when and if realized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times beginning in and  respectively  if not utilized 
the tax credit carryforwards will expire at various times beginning in if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the private sale in of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock which was subsequently converted to common stock and from the net proceeds received upon completion of our initial public offering in may as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
at december   our working capital approximated million 
in addition  we had million of restricted cash as of december  at december   total short term and long term debt totaled  and represented less than one percent of stockholders equity 

table of contents net cash used in  provided by operating activities operating activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million in and million in in  the primary source of cash was net income  as adjusted for the non cash charges for acquired in process r d  the impairment of our investment in gcs and depreciation and amortization 
uses of cash in were increases in accounts receivable and inventories and decreases in accounts payable and accrued restructuring 
our accounts receivable were million higher at the end of compared to the end of two factors were the primary contributors to the increase in accounts receivable from the end of to the end of first was the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of to million from million in fourth quarter of second we had approximately million in accounts receivable related to our acquisition of isg at the end of our annual days sales outstanding decreased from days in to days in the addition of isg s receivables and sales had the effect of increasing our days sales outstanding at the end of by nine days 
the improvement in days sales outstanding from days in was due to improvement in collections during inventories increased from million at december  to million at december  two factors were the primary contributors to the increase in inventory from the end of to first was the necessity of carrying a higher level of inventory to support the company s sales as net revenue grew from million in to million in second  the higher inventory balance at the end of included approximately  of inventories related to our acquisition of isg at the end of our annual inventory turns increased from at december  to at december  the addition of isg s inventory had the effect of decreasing our annual inventory turns by the improvement in annual turns from in was the result of better efficiency in the purchasing and manufacturing areas in we expect our days sales outstanding  and inventory turns for to be fairly consistent with what they were in  absent the impact of the isg acquisition 
accounts payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in accounts payable in was primarily the result of more efficient processing of payments to our vendors 
accrued restructuring decreased from  at december  to  at december  accrued restructuring decreased by  due to severance payments made to terminated employees and lease commitment payments 
this was partially offset by an increase to the accrued restructuring of  related to the acquisition of isg in december see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information pertaining to our restructuring activities 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  and provided cash of  in and million in the primary use of cash in investing activities in was for the purchase of isg million  purchases of capital equipment million and the purchase of available for sale securities  net million 
in addition to the consideration paid at the closing of our acquisition of isg  additional cash consideration of up to  may become due and payable for the achievement of margin contribution objectives attributable to sales of selected products for periods through december  
table of contents the first installment of any such payments would be due in if earned  and would be a maximum amount of million 
additional payments of up to million each may be paid in and in we used cash of approximately million related to our acquisition of vari l 
the capital expenditures of million in decreased from million in primary capital expenditures in were for factory automation equipment for the plant in broomfield 
we expect that our capital expenditures for to be fairly consistent with expenditures for cash provided by financing activities totaled million for compared to  in cash used in financing activities totaled  in the major financing inflow of cash in all three years was related to proceeds from employee stock plans 
the major financing use of cash in all three years was for principal payments on capital lease obligations 
we expect that our capital lease payments will decrease in the near future as our capital lease obligations recorded on our balance sheet have decreased in recent periods and totaled  as of december  we expect cash provided by employee stock plans in to be fairly consistent with this number can vary widely depending on the price of our stock and the cash needs of our employees 
under the current economic and telecommunications market conditions and the current company structure  and outlook for  we expect that we will be able to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs from the cash generated from operations for the foreseeable future 
other sources of liquidity that may be available to us are the leasing of capital equipment  a line of credit at a commercial bank  or the sale of company securities 
the issuance of any additional shares would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we draw on the other sources of liquidity and capital resources noted above to grow our business  execute our operating plans  or acquire complementary technologies or businesses  it could result in increased expense and lower profitability 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments capital lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations total total does not include certain purchase obligations as discussed in the three paragraphs immediately below 
purchase commitments are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
we include in purchase commitments contractual obligations we have with our vendors who supply us with our wafer requirements for ic based products 
because the wafers we purchase are unique to these suppliers and involve significant expense  our agreements with these suppliers prohibit cancellation subsequent to the production release of the products in our suppliers manufacturing facilities  regardless of whether our end customers cancel orders with us or our requirements are reduced 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials  other than wafer requirements for ic based products  and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase 
table of contents rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
except for wafers for our ic based products  we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also include in purchase commitments contractual obligations we have with a vendor for outsourced manufacturing services 
because certain of the components purchased by this vendor are unique and cannot be used by its other customers  our agreement to fulfill the contract prohibits cancellation of certain components subsequent to the vendor placing purchase orders with its suppliers 
we also enter into contracts with other vendors for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is based upon current information 
timing and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect sfas to have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r 

table of contents business outlook this business outlook represents the view of management as of the date of this annual report on form k and under the current economic and telecommunications market conditions  and the current company structure 
it contains many forward looking statements 
actual events or results may differ materially from any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including those described under risk factors above 
in as compared to  we saw an increase in the demand for our products across a broad spectrum of customers and applications and for a wide variety of our products 
we experienced a slight weakening in our sales level in the fourth quarter of relative to the immediately preceding quarter  due in large part to a reduction in orders by one of our large oem customers 
given our sales results in the fourth quarter of  it is uncertain whether the overall increase in sales in over represents a significant long term upturn in demand from our end customers  or a short term upturn  which is a critical factor in assessing our financial outlook 
we believe that the primary factors affecting our revenue outlook for will be the extent of growth in the overall communications and a d markets  as well as the demand from our customers for any new products we may introduce 
we continue to focus on our goal of growing revenues by increasing the market share of our existing products  and by diversifying our end markets through the development of new products and the addition of complementary products 
we believe the most significant influences on our outlook for gross margin for will be the factors mentioned under gross profit and margin overview above  including product features  product type  market  sales channel  level of integration of the product  and the efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing operations 
increasing our gross profit and maintaining our gross margin are key goals for with respect to operating expenses  we believe that the single largest factor affecting our overall operating expenses will be the extent of growth in our customers end markets and the resulting impact on our net revenues 
if the increase in sales we saw in as compared to fails to continue during  we anticipate taking actions to adjust operating expenses accordingly 
as mentioned earlier in this md a  we believe our continued success is dependent on technological advancement  including developing new technologies and differentiated products for our various market segments  driven by our research and development spending for our research and development expenses could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending largely on the timing of wafer and mask set purchases 
regarding general and administrative expense  we believe the most significant factor that might impact our estimates will be the amount and timing of the cost for complying with corporate governance and accounting rule pronouncements 
our expenses will also vary depending upon the level and type of any acquisition activity we may engage in during a given period 
these acquisition related expenses may include transaction expenses  one time charges and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
we have not yet assessed the impact that implementation of fas r  which relates to the recognition of stock based compensation expense  will have on our reported operating results 
we expect  however  that any such impact will be material and adverse to reported earnings 

table of contents we believe the most significant factors influencing our cash flow from operations for will be our net income  the length of time it takes to collect our accounts receivable and the amount of inventory we will have to buy to support our customer orders 
we believe the most significant factors influencing our non operating cash flow for will be our capital expenditures and the amount of cash received from employee stock plans 
we expect that we will be able to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future from the cash generated from operations 
we believe the most important items affecting our accounts receivable management will be the linearity of our shipments to  and the percentage of total net revenue from  our large oem customers  and their cms 
our large oems  and in particular their cms  generally pay more slowly than our other customers thereby slowing our cash collection of our accounts receivable 
we expect the current trend toward large wireless oems outsourcing their manufacturing to continue 
with the visibility we have now into this mix  our goal for is to keep our dso reasonably consistent with our experience in  absent the impact of the isg acquisition 
we believe that the two largest factors affecting our cash usage in inventory will be the order pattern of our customers and the amount of inventory required to support our forecasted demand 
as a result of our expectations regarding our future sales  we may have to increase our inventory 
with the visibility we now have into these factors  our goal is to keep our inventory turns reasonably consistent with our experience in we believe the largest factors influencing cash usage for capital expenditures will be the order patterns of our customers 
to the extent the order and sales patterns experienced in and continue  we will continue to purchase a limited amount of capital equipment in response to these orders 
factors that may influence the level of proceeds we receive from employee stock plans include our stock price level and employee cash needs for personal reasons 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although of our sales were to non us based customers and distributors in  all sales continue to be denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not had any material exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect sales into foreign markets to continue at current levels or increase in future periods  particularly in europe and asia 
because sirenza s sales are denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make its products less competitive in foreign markets 
alternatively  if the us dollar were to weaken  it would make our products more competitive in foreign markets  but could result in higher prices from our foreign vendors 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of bank deposits  federal agency and related securities and money market funds issued or managed by large financial institutions in the united states 
we did not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and available for sale investments 
for example  assuming that our cash and available for sale investments balance at december  remains unchanged  a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease sirenza s annual interest income by approximately
