item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on january  we acquired the connectivity solutions business of avaya 
the historical financial and other information included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for periods prior to january  reflects the business of commscope prior to our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business  unless otherwise noted 
because the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business is significant to us  our historical financial information may not be indicative of our financial condition and performance for future periods 
overview commscope  inc is a world leader in the design and manufacture of cable and connectivity solutions for communications networks 
we focus on the last mile in communications networks  which is the distribution access  or final link to the customer 
through our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business of avaya on january   we became a global leader in structured cabling for business enterprise applications 
we believe we are a global leader in broadband coaxial cables for the cable television industry 
we also design  manufacture and market a broad line of high performance electronic  coaxial and fiber optic cable products for data networking  internet access  wireless communication  telephony and other broadband applications 
in addition  we are a leading provider of environmentally secure enclosures and structured cabling solutions supporting central offices for telecommunication service providers in the united states 
during and  our operations were conducted within one reportable business segment  based on the similarity of products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environment 
during  as a result of the acquisition of connectivity solutions  management evaluated the results of operations in two reportable business segments the cable segment  which is the same as our cable business prior to the acquisition  and the connectivity solutions segment  which is the business acquired in january as we continue to integrate the connectivity solutions segment into our global operations and financial reporting systems  we are evaluating alternative operational and financial reporting structures that may integrate cable segment product groups with similar product groups offered by the connectivity solutions segment 
this may require us to report our results in more or different reportable segments during future periods 
net sales for increased by million to  million as compared to  primarily due to the inclusion of eleven months of net sales from the connectivity solutions segment 
net income for increased by million to million as compared to  primarily due to the gain million  after tax from the sale of our interest in ofs brightwave  an increase in gross margin to approximately during compared with approximately during  and a reduction in equity in losses of ofs brightwave million  after tax 
this increase in net income was partially offset by various charges directly and indirectly related to the connectivity solutions acquisition 
during the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the primary source of revenue from our cable segment was product sales to cable television system operators  telecommunication service providers  oems and distributors 
demand for our cable products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television system operators for maintaining  constructing and rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the primary source of revenue for our connectivity solutions segment was product sales to large  multinational companies  which are made primarily through a global network of distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
demand for connectivity solutions products depends primarily on capital spending by enterprises on communications projects in new buildings or campuses  building expansions or upgrades of network systems within buildings or campuses 
our future financial condition and performance will be dependent  in large part  on our ability to successfully complete the integration of the connectivity solutions business and on economic conditions in the industries in which we operate 
our revenues and profitability are affected by increasing consolidation in the telecommunications industry and the capital spending of our major customers  which has declined in recent years 
in addition  the financial condition of several of our customers has deteriorated in recent years 
these conditions may result in lower sales volumes to our customers  write offs of our receivables  the impairment of certain of our manufacturing assets and reductions in our workforce 
our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers  competitive pricing pressures and changes in the price of our raw materials  many of which are linked to the commodity markets 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in raw material prices through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
in addition  during we announced price increases for certain products due to the rising cost of certain raw materials 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales  cost increases could have a material effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  and rebates and distributor price protection reserves  inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  product warranty reserves  income tax valuation allowances  impairment reviews for investments  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles  pension and postretirement benefit costs  and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances and rebates and distributor price protection reserves we record estimated reductions to revenue for potential sales returns as well as customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased estimates of sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in incremental reductions to revenue 
inventory excess and obsolescence reserves we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of the cost or market principle  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
product warranty reserves we recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products 
the product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty five years from the date of sale  depending upon the product subject to the warranty 
we record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates  as appropriate  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
income tax valuation allowances we establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider the amounts and timing of future deductions or carryforwards and sources of taxable income that may enable utilization 
we maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or in future income may have a material impact on the amount of a deferred tax asset ultimately realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
impairment reviews management reviews intangible assets  investments  and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of august and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to arise from these assets 
operating performance  market conditions  and other factors may adversely impact future cash flows 
if an impairment is indicated by this analysis  the impairment charge to be recognized  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if actual future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
pension and postretirement benefit costs our pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
critical assumptions inherent in these valuations include the discount rate  health care cost trend rate  rate of return on plan assets  and mortality rates 
assumptions are subject to change each year based on changes in market conditions and in management s assumptions about future events 
changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on future pension and postretirement benefit costs 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of connectivity solutions the acquisition of connectivity solutions as of january  was accounted for using purchase accounting  which required management to make significant estimates 
first  management must estimate the cost of the acquired entity based on the fair value of the consideration paid or the fair value of the net assets acquired  whichever is more clearly evident 
this cost must then be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
in addition  management must identify and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
management utilized third party appraisals to assist in estimating the fair value of tangible property  plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired

the connectivity solutions segment s operating results have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
accordingly  the consolidated results for the year ended december  include the operating results of the connectivity solutions segment for the eleven month period from february  through december  however  the consolidated results reflected above for the year ended december  do not include any actual or pro forma results for the connectivity solutions segment 
this information should be considered when comparing the financial results of and see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
net sales below is a summary that reflects our actual net sales for the year ended december   which includes the connectivity solutions segment net sales for the eleven month period from february  through december  this summary also reflects pro forma net sales for the years ended december  and  as if connectivity solutions had been acquired on january  and  respectively 
the pro forma net sales of the connectivity solutions segment for the one month period ended january   which are included in the pro forma net sales for the year ended december   and the pro forma net sales of the connectivity solutions segment for the year ended december  are based on the historical results of the connectivity solutions business as operated by avaya during the periods presented and therefore may not be indicative of the actual results of the connectivity solutions segment as operated by us 
actual inter segment sales eliminations for the eleven month period ended december  and pro forma inter segment sales eliminations for the pro forma periods are included below 
actual pro forma dollars in millions net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollar change change net sales by segment cable segment connectivity solutions segment inter segment eliminations consolidated net sales    total domestic sales total international sales total worldwide sales    overall  consolidated net sales  on a pro forma basis  increased during primarily due to an increase in international sales of broadband video products and domestic sales of lan products within the cable segment 
in addition  improving business conditions and continuing benefits of deregulation in selected international markets contributed to the overall increase in net sales of our broadband video products 
our connectivity solutions segment experienced an increase in domestic sales of the systimax products 
as the economic environment improved during  companies increased capital spending 
cable segment dollars in millions net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollar change change broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total cable segment the increase in net sales of broadband video products for primarily resulted from strong international sales volumes and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
despite lower sales of fiber optic cable and lower sales to our largest domestic cable segment customer  sales of broadband video products increased moderately during due to price increases  higher international sales related in part to deregulation in selected markets and reconstruction related to certain storms that occurred in the southeastern us the increase in net sales of lan products was primarily driven by improved project business and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
we announced two price increases for certain lan products during as a result of significant increases in the cost of certain raw materials 
in addition  the launch of our uniprise brand contributed to the increase in net sales of lan products 
we believe that the overall improvement in the financial condition of our customers has and will continue to contribute to an increase in their information technology budgets 
the increase in net sales of wireless and other telecom products was mainly due to a higher volume of sales  primarily in wireless products in domestic markets 
the improvement in general financial conditions of our customers has led to increased spending by the major wireless carriers 
in addition  we have developed relationships with certain new customers  who generally purchase larger diameter products  which have comparatively higher prices 
we believe we continue to make steady progress communicating the cell reach value proposition to new and existing customers  both domestically and internationally 
while we expect sales of wireless products to be somewhat volatile since customer spending is mainly project driven  we remain optimistic about our long term global wireless opportunities 
connectivity solutions segment pro forma actual years ended december  eleven month period ended december  dollars in millions net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollar change change systimax products exchangemax products integrated cabinet solutions products total connectivity solutions segment the pro forma net sales in the table above for the year ended december  reflect the actual sales of the connectivity solutions segment for the eleven month period ended december  in addition to sales recognized by the connectivity solutions business in january as operated by avaya prior to our acquisition of this business on january  the pro forma net sales in the table above for the year ended december  reflect sales recognized by the connectivity solutions business during that period as operated by avaya 
the discussion below compares the pro forma net sales for the years ended december  and  since the actual net sales for the eleven month period ended december  would not be comparable with the pro forma net sales for the year ended december  however  these pro forma results may not be indicative of the actual results of the connectivity solutions segment as operated by us 
the net sales of systimax products were moderately higher during primarily due to strong domestic sales volumes driven by improved project business and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
during the first quarter of  we announced two price increases for certain products on new projects  primarily due to the rising cost of copper and certain polymers 
during the first half of  systimax sales volume was negatively impacted by an effort to reduce external inventory balances held by distributors to a more appropriate level 
during the second half of  the systimax product line reported strong sales which more than offset the impact of the first half weak sales growth 
we expect demand for systimax products to be driven by the ongoing need for bandwidth and high performance structured cabling in the enterprise market and by global information technology spending  among other things 
the decrease in net sales of exchangemax products for was primarily related to the continued impact of competitive pricing pressure and weak demand for central office telecommunications equipment 
the increase in ics net sales for was primarily due to increased sales volumes resulting from increasing service provider dsl deployments 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit increased by million to million  primarily due to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
gross profit margin increased to during compared to during  primarily due to the contribution of the connectivity solutions systimax product  as these products generated higher margins  on average  than our other products 
gross profit margin for was adversely affected by the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on the connectivity solutions segment inventory 
these purchase accounting adjustments resulted from the write up above replacement manufacturing cost of connectivity solutions finished goods and work in process inventory to reflect its acquired fair value as of the acquisition date 
this write up to fair value resulted in an increase of approximately million in cost of sales and lower margins following the connectivity solutions acquisition as the acquired inventory was sold 
the rising cost of raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  plastics and other polymers  and steel also increased cost of sales 
as a result of these higher costs  we announced price increases for certain products during  which somewhat offset the impact of higher raw material prices on gross margin during although we expect to continue to recover these increased raw material costs by raising prices of certain products  the inability to achieve market acceptance of the price increases could result in lower gross profit and gross profit margin 
gross profit margin should benefit from cost reduction initiatives begun during the fourth quarter of at csmi s omaha facility see restructuring costs below 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million to million during  primarily due to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to of net sales during compared to of net sales during in addition to costs associated with the acquisition  the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales  was primarily driven by increases in sales and marketing expenses to bring new products to market and to market existing product groups 
additional increases in sg a were primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs  insurance costs  professional fees related to new regulatory requirements  and travel costs 
research and development r d expense increased by million to million during primarily due to the acquisition of connectivity solutions  which involves more extensive research and development activities than the cable segment 
at the time of the acquisition of connectivity solutions  we gained over r d professionals who focus on fundamental research  product development and enhancements  and manufacturing processes related to our connectivity solutions segment products 
during  we incurred r d costs primarily related to developing new enterprise structured cabling solutions as well as cost effective designs for cables  apparatus and cabinets 
impairment charges for fixed assets during the fourth quarter of  million of fixed asset impairment charges were recognized as a component of the restructuring costs incurred in connection with the cost reduction initiatives at csmi s omaha facility see restructuring costs below 
during the second quarter of  as a result of the difficult global business environment in telecommunications and an ongoing decline in demand  both domestically and internationally  and reduced export sales from our brazilian operation  we determined that certain domestic and brazilian manufacturing fixed assets were impaired 
accordingly  we obtained third party appraisals of the majority of these specifically identified assets to determine their fair values and the resulting amount of impairment charges to be recognized 
in total  we recognized pretax impairment charges as follows in millions domestic broadband cable manufacturing assets brazilian broadband cable manufacturing assets brazilian wireless cable manufacturing assets other domestic manufacturing assets total impairment charges in process research and development charges we recognized a million pretax charge in for the write off of in process r d acquired in our acquisition of connectivity solutions 
this r d was valued as an intangible asset by independent appraisal in accordance with purchase accounting guidance 
since r d activities are required to be expensed as incurred under us generally accepted accounting principles  this acquired intangible asset was written off immediately following the acquisition date  with subsequent adjustments and write offs resulting from changes in the purchase price allocation 
acquisition related transition and startup costs we incurred pretax charges of million during as a result of startup  transition and other costs related to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
these charges primarily related to information technology  transition activities and other acquisition related costs 
we reduced the connectivity solutions segment workforce by approximately employees  or of the segment s global workforce  during the first quarter of the reductions were primarily related to our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost 
we recorded net pretax charges of approximately million in acquisition related transition and startup costs for employee termination benefits related to this workforce reduction 
restructuring costs we recognized a million pretax charge for restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of related to organizational and cost reduction initiatives at csmi s omaha  nebraska facility 
csmi s omaha facility is part of the connectivity solutions segment and was acquired on january  as part of the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business of avaya 
the charge consisted of million of employee related costs  including severance pay and related fringe benefits and a net curtailment loss  million of impairment charges related to manufacturing equipment that is no longer used in operations  and million of process improvement costs related to consulting and other costs associated with modifying the manufacturing operations 
we anticipate that we will recognize additional pretax restructuring charges of million to million to complete the implementation of the initiatives during the first half of as a result of these initiatives  there is excess real estate and equipment capacity at the omaha facility 
management is evaluating alternatives for such excess capacity and additional charges  which could be material to our results of operations and financial position  may result from such evaluation 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recognized a million pretax loss during on the early extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes 
this loss includes premiums paid and accrued to note holders of million and the write off of the remaining balance of related long term financing costs of million 
see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
net interest expense net interest expense during was million  compared to million during our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  although our average interest rate decreased  net interest expense increased due to higher average outstanding balances of long term debt  incurred primarily for the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
the decrease in the effective interest rate was primarily due to the refinancing in march and april of our then existing million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes with the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for  compared to for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
in conjunction with our connectivity solutions acquisition  we significantly increased the number of international locations in which we conduct business 
ofs brightwave  llc effective april   furukawa made additional equity investments in ofs brightwave and we elected not to make further corresponding investments in ofs brightwave 
as a result  our ownership percentage was reduced from to 
primarily as a result of the continuing weakness in the fiber optic cable market and furukawa s continuing efforts to restructure its ofs operations  we agreed with furukawa to further amend our existing contractual arrangements in the second quarter of for the mutual benefit of both companies 
on june   we agreed with furukawa to change the period in which we could exercise our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa from to any time on or after june  and changed the exercise price from million in cash to the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa 
on june   we exercised our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa in exchange for the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa  which had a fair value of million as of the transaction date 
we currently hold these shares as treasury stock 
as a result of this transaction  we no longer own any equity interest in ofs brightwave 
however  we maintained our strategic relationship with furukawa by entering into a new four year optical fiber supply agreement with ofs fitel  llc fitel  a wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa  replacing the existing supply agreement with fitel that was scheduled to expire in november through this supply agreement  we continue to have access to a broad array of technologically advanced optical fibers 
we also have a cross license arrangement with a subsidiary of furukawa for key intellectual property 
the ofs brightwave transaction resulted in a net pretax gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share during this gain represents the fair value of the common stock received by us in exchange for the transfer of our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa  plus the realized gain from our cumulative equity method share of ofs brightwave s unrealized foreign currency translation gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  less an million impairment charge related to fully impairing the million note receivable from ofs brightwave 
this transaction does not affect our right to receive full payment from ofs brightwave under the million revolving note due in  based on its original terms 
our share of the losses of ofs brightwave for the period from january  through june  was approximately million  pretax  compared to approximately million during the results reflected the impact of impairment charges for certain fixed assets and intangible assets  restructuring and employee separation costs 
we realized a tax benefit related to our share of the losses of approximately million in and million in outlook we currently anticipate an overall improvement in business conditions in both north america and europe 
in addition  the completion of our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china should increase our presence in the asia pacific region 
we believe market conditions for both the cable segment and connectivity solutions segment should allow for modest revenue growth during  due to price increases and a slight increase in sales volume 
we have increased prices in response to increases in the cost of raw materials such as copper  aluminum and plastics 
in order to achieve an increase in sales  we are dependent upon continued spending for maintenance of existing infrastructure and ongoing capital investment by our customers 
we expect operating income to increase during as we continue to integrate the connectivity solutions segment into our global operations 
we also believe the impact of restructuring the omaha facility operations should result in improved profitability during comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  millions of net sales millions of net sales dollar change change net sales gross profit sg a expense r d expense impairment charges for fixed assets and investments equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc  net of tax net income loss net income loss per share net sales net sales decreased due to lower sales of broadband video products to certain domestic broadband service providers and lower sales of fiber optic cable 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in net sales of our lan products and our wireless and other telecom products 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollar change change broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales the decrease in net sales of broadband video products primarily resulted from a lower volume of sales to certain domestic broadband service providers  including charter  comcast and adelphia  in addition to a significant decline in fiber optic cable pricing 
comcast merged with at t broadband in november during the year ended december   comcast accounted for approximately of our net sales compared to approximately of our net sales as if they were combined with at t broadband for the full year ended december  accounts receivable from comcast comprised approximately of the company s net accounts receivables as of december   compared to  as of december  international sales  primarily for broadband video products  were relatively stable 
the increase in net sales of lan products was primarily driven by a higher volume of sales of fiber optic cable and improved project business 
the increase in net sales of wireless and other telecom products was mainly due to a higher volume of sales primarily in wireless products 
the improvement in general economic conditions led to increased spending by the major wireless carriers 
in addition  we developed relationships with new customers  who generally purchase larger diameter products  which have comparatively higher prices 
we believe we continue to make steady progress communicating the cell reach value proposition to new and existing customers  both domestically and internationally 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales although gross profit declined by approximately primarily due to lower sales  gross profit margin remained stable at of net sales 
an increase in the cost of certain raw materials was offset by cost savings due to the reduction in workforce in and early  detailed below 
while gross profit margins for broadband video and lan products were relatively stable  gross profit margins for wireless and other telecom products increased significantly 
however  gross profit margins for wireless and other telecom products were below corporate average and were volatile as a result of aggressive competition  mix and ongoing pricing pressures 
we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or  during the third quarter of in december  we announced an additional reduction of our workforce of approximately employees  or  that was effective in january the reductions were primarily in response to the challenging global telecommunications environment 
we recorded total pretax charges related to these workforce reductions of approximately million in cost of sales for employee termination benefits during selling  general and administrative expense the higher sg a expense in was primarily due to the bad debt expense incurred related to the write off of adelphia receivables  which totaled million 
excluding the adelphia write off  sg a expense increased million  or  during  which was primarily driven by higher insurance premiums and increased incentive compensation and other employee benefit costs 
sg a expenses for also included approximately million related to the then pending acquisition of connectivity solutions 
we have taken charges for doubtful accounts as a result of the difficult market environment based on our analysis of customer financial difficulties  age of receivable balances and other relevant factors 
research and development r d expense remained stable at approximately of net sales 
during  our major r d projects consisted of research and engineering activities related to expanding our drop cable and lan optical fiber product offerings 
we also focused on developing more cost effective product designs 
impairment charges for fixed assets during the second quarter of  as a result of the difficult global business environment in telecommunications and an ongoing decline in demand  both domestically and internationally  and reduced export sales from our brazilian operation  we determined that certain domestic and brazilian manufacturing fixed assets were likely impaired 
accordingly  we obtained third party appraisals of the majority of these specifically identified assets to determine their fair values and the resulting amount of impairment charges to be recognized 
in total  we recognized pretax impairment charges on fixed assets as follows in millions domestic broadband cable manufacturing assets brazilian broadband cable manufacturing assets brazilian wireless cable manufacturing assets other domestic manufacturing assets total impairment charges due to the difficult business environment in telecommunications and the continuing decline in demand for our products  we performed a test of recoverability for our long lived assets during as a result of this impairment test we recognized pretax impairment charges as follows in millions wireless cable manufacturing assets fiber optic cable manufacturing assets other telecommunications cable manufacturing assets other manufacturing assets total impairment charges net interest expense net interest expense for was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  although our average interest rate increased  net interest expense decreased primarily due to lower average outstanding balances of long term debt 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc for the years ended december  and  our share of the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million and million  pretax  respectively 
we realized a tax benefit related to our share of the losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
ofs brightwave operates in some of the same markets we do and its financial results were also adversely affected by the difficult global business conditions 
as a result  ofs brightwave incurred pretax losses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the losses included charges of million related primarily to the impairment of certain fixed assets and intangible assets  restructuring and employee separation costs 
the losses included charges of million  net of a million tax benefit from losses generated by a domestic corporate subsidiary of ofs brightwave  for the write off of goodwill and certain fixed assets  restructuring and employee separation costs and other cost reduction activities 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview our principal sources of liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis  are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce cash provided by operations and limit availability under credit facilities 
in addition  increases in working capital  excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  related to increasing sales could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections of accounts receivable catch up to the higher level of billings 
dollar change change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities working capital  excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and current portion of long term debt capital expenditures long term debt  including current portion book capital structure long term debt as a percentage of book capital structure the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  was primarily due to the use of million of cash on hand as a portion of the purchase price for connectivity solutions 
we borrowed million under our new senior secured credit facility for the balance of the acquisition cost 
in addition  we used the proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures during to repurchase and redeem all million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  to repay million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 
this net decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was partially offset by cash flows from operations  as discussed below 
the increase in working capital was driven by our acquisition of connectivity solutions during the first quarter of see further discussion of working capital changes below 
our long term debt as a percent of book capital structure increased during primarily due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures and borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  which was partially offset by the extinguishment of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
our book capital structure was also impacted by our issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million  as a portion of the purchase price for the connectivity solutions business and our receipt of approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million  from furukawa in a nonmonetary exchange for our investment in ofs brightwave 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased year over year primarily due to the additional operating cash inflows provided by the connectivity solutions segment for the eleven months ended december  as we worked to reduce inventory balances in our connectivity solutions segment to a more appropriate level 
partially offsetting this increase were acquisition related transition and startup costs paid in of approximately million 
in addition  we also paid approximately million in income taxes in we expect to generate net cash from operations during primarily due to increased margins from sales of certain product groups 
in addition  we will continue to focus on enhancing operational efficiency and internal growth from all of our product groups and the further integration of the connectivity solutions segment 
investing activities our investment in property  plant and equipment was higher during primarily due to the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business 
the increase in capital spending during was primarily related to cost reduction efforts  information technology initiatives and additional production capability in asia  including the construction of a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
we expect total capital expenditures to remain at a level below consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the next several years 
as discussed further below  as of january   we completed the acquisition from avaya of substantially all of the assets  subject to certain current liabilities  and assumed approximately million of other specified liabilities  primarily related to employee benefits  of connectivity solutions 
financing activities on january   in connection with our acquisition of connectivity solutions  we replaced our then existing million secured credit facility with a new million senior secured credit facility 
the purchase price for connectivity solutions consisted of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at million 
the cash portion of the purchase price consisted of million from our existing cash balances and million from borrowings under the new year million senior secured credit facility  which amended and restated our previous secured credit facility 
this new senior secured credit facility is comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility and is secured by substantially all of our assets  is guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries and contains certain financial and restrictive covenants 
the balance outstanding under the term loan facility as of december  was million and is required to be repaid by us in consecutive quarterly installments of million with a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest on december  we had availability under the new revolving credit facility of approximately million and had no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  our ability to borrow under this revolving credit facility depends on the amount of our borrowing base  which is determined as specified percentages of our eligible receivables and inventory  reduced for certain reserves and the total amount of letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants under this senior secured credit facility as of december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of the terms of this senior secured credit facility 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures due march  the proceeds from these debentures were used primarily to extinguish our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due december   to repay million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and for general corporate purposes 
we repurchased or redeemed all of our convertible subordinated notes during march and april the repurchase and redemption of these notes resulted in a million pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of the terms of these debentures 
as of october   we  together with furukawa  purchased million shares of our common stock from lucent

of the million shares of our common stock purchased from lucent  furukawa purchased approximately million shares and we repurchased the remaining approximately million shares  which are currently classified as treasury stock 
we funded our million repurchase using existing cash balances 
as of december  and  furukawa owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in june  we exchanged our entire equity interest in ofs brightwave for the approximately million shares of our stock owned by furukawa and those shares are currently classified as treasury stock 
future cash needs we expect that our primary future cash needs will be to fund working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and employee obligations 
we believe we have incurred all of the acquisition related transition and startup costs associated with connectivity solutions during in addition  we assumed approximately million of other specified liabilities in connection with our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business  primarily related to employee benefits 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans during these noncurrent employee benefit liabilities will be funded with cash flows from future operations 
in conjunction with the restructuring initiatives at csmi s omaha facility  we have accrued a million liability as of december   which is expected to be paid during the first half of we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs 
we may  from time to time  borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities  if market conditions are favorable  to meet our future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs

the principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum  plastics and other polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
prices for copper  fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have increased substantially over the last twelve months 
as a result  we have significantly increased our prices for certain enterprise and broadband products and may have to increase prices again in the future 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales  these cost increases could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations upon final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing the use  discharge  disposal and remediation of hazardous materials 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
newly issued accounting standards in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  disclosure requirements under fasb statement no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  relating to contingently convertible securities 
this fsp interprets how the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
apply to contingently convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on net income loss per share 
the guidance in this fsp was effective immediately and applies to all existing and newly created securities 
we believe that our disclosures comply with the requirements of this fsp 
in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
the fsp states that if the benefits provided by a plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d  measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost on or after the date of enactment should reflect the effects of the act 
it also requires employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act 
we implemented this fsp on a prospective basis as of july  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
in october  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
issue no 
requires that all instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingent on market conditions indexed to an issuer s share price be included in diluted net income per share if dilutive regardless of whether the market conditions have been met 
this consensus was effective for the year ended december  issue no 
applies retroactively to instruments outstanding at the date of adoption of this consensus and requires prior period diluted net income per share amounts to be restated to conform to this consensus 
we believe that our convertible senior subordinated debentures issued in march are subject to the requirements of issue no 
see notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for the impact of the application of this consensus on our diluted net income per share 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement is the result of efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  and rehandling costs be recognized as expenses in the current period 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective on a prospective basis for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   though earlier adoption is permitted 
application of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which establishes standards related to the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instrument for goods or services 
this revised standard also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of these equity instruments 
sfas no 
focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this standard is effective for periods beginning after june  we believe that this standard will have a material impact on our statement of operations 
the pro forma effects on net income loss and net income loss per share related to the application of this standard  had we applied fair value recognition provisions for the years ended december   and  are reported in note of the notes in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the reasonable use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments which may be used by us  include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts  and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as fabricated aluminum  plastics and other polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products have resulted in  and may continue to result in  higher overall production costs 
in conjunction with our connectivity solutions acquisition  we significantly increased the number of international locations in which we conduct business 
approximately of our sales were to customers located outside the us  compared to in although we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars  a portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly sales from some of our foreign subsidiaries 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
the acquisition of our belgian subsidiary created a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the euro compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
prior to its termination  our eurodollar credit agreement served as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
in december  we terminated this hedging relationship and entered into a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange swap agreement expiring in  which we designated as a new hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
our investment in brazil during created a new foreign subsidiary and a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
we continue to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk of our net investment in the brazilian subsidiary 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange swap agreement  which serves as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
settlement of the fair value of this net investment hedging instrument as of december  and would have resulted in a loss of approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax 
these unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate hedging alternatives related to additional foreign currency exposures 
in addition  we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
our non derivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade receivables  trade payables  and debt instruments 
at december  and  the carrying values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and or short terms to maturity  with the exception of our convertible debentures  which were recorded in the financial statements at million and had a fair value of approximately million at december   and our convertible notes  which were recorded in the financial statements at million and had a fair value of approximately million at december  fair value of our debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements  or quoted market prices whenever available 
the following tables summarize our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure as of december  and the tables present principal and interest cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates for each year represent the interest rate effective for the related loan as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
the foreign currency exchange rate used to disclose the net interest payments under the cross currency swap agreement was based on the us dollar euro exchange rate as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
the tables assume payments will be made in accordance with due dates in the respective agreements and no prepayment of any amounts due 
the tabular format used below does not reflect our option to redeem all or a portion of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures at any time on or after march  at of the principal amount plus accrued interest  the holders option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the debentures on march   march  and march  for of the principal amount plus accrued interest  or the holders right to convert the debenture into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k
