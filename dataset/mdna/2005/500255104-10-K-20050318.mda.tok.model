restatement of financial statements following a review of the company s lease accounting practices in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company corrected its method of accounting for leases related to stores that are located on leased land as well as for certain stores with operating leases 
to reflect this correction  the company restated its consolidated financial statements beginning with fiscal historically  when accounting for leases with renewal options  the company recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable lease term  with the term commencing when actual rent payments began 
depreciation of the buildings  leasehold improvements and other long lived assets on those properties occurred over a period that may have included both the initial non cancelable lease and the option periods provided for in the lease 
kohl s previously believed that their audited financial statements  which reflected longstanding lease accounting treatments  were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company revised its accounting to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
this accounting adjustment resulted in the company using a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term will be the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise 
these adjustments are further discussed in note  restatement of financial statements  to the consolidated financial statements 
the correction of this accounting requires the company to record additional deferred rent in other long term liabilities and to adjust deferred income taxes and retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets  as well as to correct rent expense included in s  g a expense  depreciation expense and preopening expense  and the resulting effect on the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
the cumulative effect of these accounting changes is a reduction of retained earnings of million as of the beginning of fiscal and decreases to retained earnings of million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
see note  restatement of financial statements to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheets as of january   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of income and cash flows for fiscal years and the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the aging of accounts  historical write off experience and specific review for potential bad debts 
delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
for all other accounts  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience 
factors that would cause this allowance to increase primarily relate to increased customer bankruptcies or other difficulties that make further collection unlikely 
conversely  improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease in the provision 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out lifo basis using the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
based on a review of historical clearance markdowns  current business trends  expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories  an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes that the company s inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program

impairment of assets and closed store reserves the company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights 
the related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to years 
the company reviews long lived assets held for use including favorable lease rights for impairment annually or whenever an event  such as decisions to close a store  indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves 
decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
if the store is leased  a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use 
a significant change in cash flows  market valuation  demand for real estate or other factors  could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge

new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
as of january   the company had two long term compensation plans  which are described in note  preferred and common stock  to the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
no stock based employee compensation expense is reflected in fiscal  and net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant and the number of shares is fixed 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to reduce diluted net income per share by approximately in fiscal with the expense being incurred in approximately equal quarterly amounts throughout the year 
if the company had adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in the table in note  business and summary of accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than august  with early adoption permitted in periods in which the financial statements have not yet been issued 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the company will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified retrospective method 
the company will restate its financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings 
at january   the company s long term debt  excluding capital leases  was million  all of which is fixed rate debt 
long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital 
when these debt instruments mature  the company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates  which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt

during fiscal  average borrowings under the company s variable rate revolving credit facilities and its short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were million 
if interest rates on the average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt changed by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would change by  and  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments
