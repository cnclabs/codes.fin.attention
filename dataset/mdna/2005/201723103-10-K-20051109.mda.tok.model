item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we manufacture  recycle  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
our segment reporting includes five reportable segments domestic mills  cmc zawiercie cmcz  domestic fabrication  recycling and marketing and distribution 
the domestic mills segment includes the company s domestic steel minimills including the scrap processing facilities which directly support these mills and the copper tube minimill 
the copper tube minimill is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics 
the cmcz minimill and subsidiaries in poland have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of their markets and the regulatory environment in which they operate are different from the company s domestic minimills 
the domestic fabrication segment consists of the company s rebar and joist fabrication operations  fence post manufacturing plants  construction related and other products facilities 
the recycling segment consists of the cmc recycling division s scrap processing and sales operations primarily in texas  florida and the southern united states 
marketing and distribution includes both domestic and international operations for the sales  distribution and processing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals and other industrial products 
the segment s activities consist only of physical transactions and not speculation 
domestic mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes  scrap processing facilities that directly support these minimills  and a copper tube minimill 
cmcz operations we conduct our cmcz minimill operation through a rolling mill that produces primarily reinforcing bar  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  and our majority owned scrap processing facilities that directly support cmcz 
domestic fabrication operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel fabrication and processing plants that bend  weld  cut  fabricate and place steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce special sections for floors and ceiling support  plants that produce steel fence posts  plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility  and a railroad salvage company 
recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  south carolina  tennessee  and texas 

table of contents marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures around the world 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
you should read this management s discussion and analysis in connection with your review of our consolidated audited financial statements and the accompanying footnotes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are received based on the terms of the sale 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the entire loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
contingencies we make accruals as needed for litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we base our environmental liabilities on estimates regarding the number of sites for which we will be responsible  the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that we expect we will share with other parties and the timing of the remediation 
where timing of expenditures can be reliably estimated  we discount amounts to reflect our cost of capital over time 
we record these and other contingent liabilities when they are probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
where timing and amounts cannot be precisely estimated  we estimate a range  and we recognize the low end of the range without discounting 
also  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
beginning fiscal  we refined our method of estimating our interim lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at quarter end and recording the resulting lifo expense in its entirety 
at the end of each of the prior years quarters  we estimated both inventory quantities and costs that we expected at the end of the fiscal years for these lifo calculations  and we recorded an amount on a pro rata basis 
these estimates could vary substantially from the actual year end results  causing an adjustment to cost of goods sold in our fourth quarter 
see note  quarterly financial data  to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our domestic mills  cmcz and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred

table of contents consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings per diluted share ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo effect on net earnings expense income per diluted share last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management 
reconciliations to net earnings are provided below for the year ended august in millions net earnings interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
because we have borrowed money in order to partially finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes 
our ebitda increased to million for our fiscal year ended august  as compared to million in the following events had a significant financial impact during our fiscal year ended august  as compared to our fiscal year we reported our highest net sales and net earnings ever 
increased selling prices and margins resulted in significantly higher adjusted operating profits in all of our segments  except for cmcz 
our domestic steel mills adjusted operating profit increased due to much higher selling prices and metal margins  which more than offset a decline in finished goods shipments as compared to selling prices and margins at cmcz decreased as compared to due largely to the relatively strong polish zloty which limited its exports and weak construction activity in western europe  resulting in more competition in poland 
adjusted operating profit in our domestic fabrication segment increased significantly due to higher selling prices  margins and increased shipments 

table of contents ferrous and nonferrous scrap prices were volatile although average prices increased during as compared to total domestic scrap processed and shipped decreased slightly during we attained record adjusted operating profits in our marketing and distribution segment due to robust demand across multiple product lines and geographic areas 
we recorded a million after tax lifo expense per diluted share compared to million lifo expense per diluted share in we recorded million pre tax related to insurance recoveries primarily for business interruption insurance at our smi texas and smi south carolina mills 
our overall effective tax rate increased to as compared to in due to shifts in profitability among tax jurisdictions 
in  our net earnings reached all time record levels as a result of the combination of historically high selling prices and margins in most of our segments 
these positive factors more than offset increased purchase prices and other input costs 
global market conditions were favorable which resulted in significantly increased selling prices and metal margins  especially for our domestic steel mills  domestic fabrication and various products in our marketing and distribution segment 
these market conditions included strong demand in asia  a resilient us economy and the relatively weak us dollar 
our strategy of diversifying our business by segment  products and geography allowed us to take advantage of the positive environment 
conditions improved significantly during the fourth quarter of fiscal as end users had depleted their inventories  and our net earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal exceeded those for any previous fiscal quarter that we have ever reported 
segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before minority interests and income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit is the sum of our earnings before income taxes  minority interests and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for our domestic mills and domestic fabrication segments because these segments require minimal outside financing 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations adjusted operating profit loss domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations acquired december dollars are before minority interests 

table of contents compared to domestic mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in our domestic mills segment 
in  our domestic mills segment set an all time annual record for adjusted operating profits 
our domestic mills segments adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  increased by million as compared to on million more net sales 
net sales and adjusted operating profit were higher in due primarily to higher selling prices and metal margins at our domestic steel mills as compared to metal margins the difference between the average selling price and cost of scrap consumed for the segment increased significantly in as compared to because increases in selling prices at our domestic steel mills more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs 
although our copper tube minimill increased its selling prices during as compared to  purchase prices of copper scrap increased even more 
as a result  our metal margin declined for this mill 
also  expenses related to valuing our inventories under the lifo method decreased as compared to primarily because scrap purchase and other input costs did not increase as rapidly in as compared to during the year ended august   we recorded million recoveries for the settlement of insurance claims relating to prior year transformer failures at our steel minimills 
adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for selling prices and metal margins increased in as compared to due to strong global demand for steel 
also  the competition from foreign steel imports was less as a result of the weaker us dollar and stronger global markets 
average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year due primarily to increased world demand for ferrous scrap 
our overall metal margins increased  resulting in significantly higher total adjusted operating profits for the four steel minimills in as compared to the table below reflects domestic steel and ferrous scrap prices per ton for the year ended august increase average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average ferrous scrap purchase price average fifo metal margin the domestic steel minimills production and shipment levels tons melted  rolled and shipped for the year ended august  decreased slightly as compared to the at all time record levels set in as our customers worked through excess inventories 
during  we scheduled our maintenance and lowered our production in order to most effectively manage our inventory levels 
the table below reflects our domestic steel minimills operating statistics for the year ended august decrease short tons in thousands amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped adjusted operating profits for our domestic steel minimills were as follows for the year ended august increase decrease in thousands smi texas smi south carolina smi alabama smi arkansas 
table of contents overall  our domestic steel minimills recorded million lifo expense in as compared to million in our utility expenses increased by thousand in as compared to electricity decreased by thousand due to both lower usage from decreased overall production and rate decreases due to refunds 
natural gas costs increased by million due to higher rates which more than offset lower usage 
costs for ferroalloys increased by million in as compared to largely due to more demand from us mills  the impact of the weaker us dollar and higher ocean freight costs on these imported items 
also  in  all of our domestic steel minimills focused on controlling costs and improving productivity  quality and safety 
the texas highway building program provided good business opportunities for smi texas 
a new scrap yard was established at smi alabama to improve scrap flow and reduce congestion inside the mill and reduce scrap handling costs 
the installation of a new electric arc furnace transformer and expansion of the baghouse at smi south carolina increased our steel melting capacity 
during the year ended august   smi texas and smi south carolina recorded million and million  respectively  from insurance recoveries see note commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was million during the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million for although our average selling price for copper tube increased  our average copper scrap purchase cost increased more than our average selling price resulting in decreased metal margins in as compared to copper scrap purchase prices increased because global demand for copper scrap exceeded supply 
however  we could not increase our selling prices for copper tube because of pressure from alternative competing products such as plastic water tubing and consolidation among our customers 
the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s prices per pound and operating statistics for the year ended august increase decrease pounds in millions amount pounds shipped pounds produced average selling price average scrap purchase cost average fifo metal margin our copper tube minimill recorded thousand lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million in cmcz on december   our swiss subsidiary acquired of the outstanding shares of huta zawiercie  sa cmcz  a steel minimill in zawiercie  poland

also  our ability to export cmcz s products from poland to 
table of contents other key international markets was limited in due to the strong polish zloty  especially relative to the euro 
however  we reported an adjusted operating profit from cmcz of million during our fourth quarter as market conditions improved 
functional currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on adjusted operating profits 
domestic fabrication our domestic fabrication businesses reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in net sales were billion in  an increase of million as compared to during the year ended august   we acquired the operating assets of jl davidson company s rebar fabricating facility in california and a joist manufacturing plant in juarez  mexico 
these acquisitions did not significantly impact our adjusted operating profit 
on december   we acquired of the stock of lofland acquisition  inc lofland which operates steel reinforcing bar fabrication and construction related product sales facilities in texas  arkansas  louisiana  oklahoma  new mexico and mississippi 
during the first four months of  this acquisition accounted for million and million in net sales and adjusted operating profit  respectively  and also accounted for thousand tons shipped during the same period 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
our domestic fabrication segment s overall adjusted operating profit increased in as compared to due to our overall higher average selling prices and higher shipments which more than offset increases in our steel purchase costs 
market conditions were favorable  resulting in higher gross margins in all of our product lines including rebar fabrication  construction related products  steel fence posts  steel joists  castellated beams and structural steel fabrication 
the table below shows our average fabrication selling prices per short ton excluding stock and buyout sales and total fabrication plant shipments for the years ended august increase amount average selling price tons shipped in thousands excluding stock and buyout sales we recorded million of lifo expense in our domestic fabrication segment for the year ended august   due to the higher cost of steel and more inventories on hand 
during the year ended august   we recorded million of lifo expense 
during the year ended august   we recorded impairment charges of million 
see note  asset impairment charges  to the consolidated financial statements 
we are continuing to evaluate certain other facilities which are performing below our expectations or for which we are considering alternative uses 
our current estimates of cash flows do not indicate that the assets are impaired 
however  these estimates and expected uses could change resulting in additional asset impairments 
recycling our recycling segment reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared with an adjusted operating profit of million in net sales for the year ended august  were higher at million 
gross margins in were higher as compared to our ferrous and nonferrous scrap selling prices increased because demand from far eastern buyers  especially china  and the weaker us dollar resulted in more scrap exports by our competitors  especially early in fiscal the ferrous scrap market was extremely volatile during  and scrap prices generally decreased after our first quarter 
our ferrous sales volumes decreased slightly during as compared to due to production cutbacks and cautious buying by our steel mill customers 
however  by the end of the fourth quarter  global demand for ferrous scrap increased which resulted in increased prices 
during  our nonferrous scrap shipments increased as compared to due to higher demand for aluminum  copper and stainless steel scrap  although demand for stainless weakened in our fourth 
table of contents quarter 
the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per short ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august increase decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped includes all of our domestic processing plants 
also  we recorded million lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million in  due primarily to increased average material purchase costs for the fiscal year 
marketing and distribution net sales in our marketing and distribution segment increased by billion for the year ended august  to billion as compared to  million of which resulted from functional currency fluctuations 
our adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
our increased profitability in marketing and distribution was largely the result of our strategy in recent years to build up our regional business around the world and to increase our downstream presence 
the net effect of functional currency fluctuations on our adjusted operating profit was immaterial 
the majority of the increases in net sales and adjusted operating profit were due to higher shipments and selling prices in as compared to the effect of these increases was partially offset by million lifo expense in lifo expense of million was recorded in markets were favorable in most geographic regions around the world 
we imported more steel  aluminum  copper and stainless steel semi finished products into the united states  and gross margins for these products were higher in as compared to our net sales to and within europe  asia including china and australia increased significantly in as compared to due mainly to significant selling price increases which more than offset increases in purchases costs for our products and higher freight costs 
our sales and adjusted operating profits for industrial materials and products including minerals  ores  refractories  ferroalloys and various metals and alloys were at record levels because of strong global demand from the metals industry and short supply 
also  we added several new products 
however  during our fourth quarter  prices decreased for some industrial materials and products  returning to more historical levels 
during  we received a dividend of czk million million from our investee  trinecke zelezarny  a czech steel mill  as compared to a dividend of czk million million received in corporate and eliminations we recognized income of million on investment assets in our segregated trust for our benefit restoration plan during the year ended august  see note  employees retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended august   we incurred a million charge from the repurchase of million of our notes payable otherwise due in consolidated data on a consolidated basis  the lifo method of inventory valuation decreased our net earnings by million and million cents and per diluted share for the years ended august  and  respectively 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended august  as compared to most of this increase was due to higher discretionary bonuses and profit sharing accruals during the year ended august  as compared to due to increased earnings 
our acquisitions of cmcz and lofland accounted for million of the increase for the year ended august  our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended august  included asset impairment charges of million and losses on reacquisition of debt of million 
foreign currency fluctuations resulted in increases in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended august  as compared to our interest expense increased by million during as compared to due primarily to increased discount costs on extended term documentary letters of credit 
in addition  short term interest rates increased more than on an annualized basis during the year ended august  as compared to 
table of contents our effective tax rate for the year ended august  increased to as compared to in due to a shift in profitability from low tax jurisdictions poland to those domestic jurisdictions subject to state taxes 
near term outlook we expect that the positive market conditions that resulted in our record net sales and adjusted operating profits will continue in our fiscal year ending august  overall  our selling prices and volumes should be sustainable 
we are concerned about the potential impacts of inflationary pressures on the global economy  the decline in consumer confidence in the us and significantly higher energy costs 
however  the us economy has been historically quite resilient and the manufacturing and construction sectors remained quite strong as we began our first quarter of fiscal we believe that excess inventories in the steel supply chain have been utilized in most of our markets 
we anticipate that our domestic steel mills and fabrication operations will benefit significantly from the us multi year transportation bill that was passed during august we are also anticipating some increased demand in asia and europe  but prices could moderate with increasing supply  partially due to chinese overproduction of certain products 
we have experienced some short term power outages and transportation difficulties at our us gulf coast operations in those markets affected by hurricanes katrina and rita 
the overall short term effects of these storms have not significantly impacted our operations 
in the medium and longer term  we believe that the resulting increased demolition and recycled metals  and the reconstruction requirements in the us gulf area will significantly benefit our operations 
we anticipate that our net earnings will continue to be strong for our first quarter ended november   especially in our domestic mills and domestic fabrication segments 
although we have scheduled major maintenance  we believe that cmcz will be profitable 
we also expect good earnings in our recycling and marketing and distribution segments 
accordingly  we estimate that our first quarter lifo diluted net earnings per share will be between and 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act which offers a limited window of opportunity to repatriate certain cash dividends from foreign subsidiaries at a reduced rate 
the company is currently still evaluating the act  and we anticipate reaching final conclusions regarding the implications of the act in fiscal we anticipate that our capital spending for will be million  including the completion of our shredder at cmcz and our continuous caster project at our smi texas melt shop 
we believe that we will derive benefits from reduced operating costs and increased productivity in from these projects and other capital projects that we completed during long term outlook the rapid expansion of a number of emerging economies  including china and india  has been a major catalyst for the strong steel and nonferrous markets around the world 
the magnitude of the growth in these economies has been a new dynamic in the global marketplace 
therefore  we believe that there is an enhanced prospect of significant long term growth in demand for the global materials sector 
we believe that we are well positioned to exploit long term opportunities 
we expect strong demand for our products due to continuing recovery in demand throughout the major global economies as well as continued growth in developing countries 
emerging countries often have a higher growth rate for steel and nonferrous metals consumption 
we believe that the demand will increase in asia  particularly in china and india  as well as in central and eastern europe 
we believe that there will be further consolidation in our industries  and we plan to continue to participate in a prudent way 
the reasons for further consolidation include a historically inadequate return on capital for many companies  a high degree of fragmentation  the need to eliminate non competitive capacity and more effective marketing 

table of contents compared to domestic mills our domestic mills segments adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  increased by million as compared to on million more net sales 
net sales and adjusted operating profit were higher in due primarily to higher selling prices and shipments as compared to metal margins the difference between the average selling price and the cost of scrap consumed for the segment increased significantly in as compared to because increases in selling prices more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs and much higher expenses related to valuing our inventories under the lifo method 
our lifo expenses increased due to our higher scrap purchase and other input costs  as well as increased inventory quantities 
adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for selling prices and shipments increased in as compared to due to stronger demand  which was partially due to the recovering us economy 
also  the competition from foreign steel imports was less as a result of the weaker us dollar and stronger global markets  especially in china 
average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year due primarily to increased world demand for ferrous scrap

although another replacement transformer was installed  it had a lower capacity  resulting in lower production than we had planned 
in order to meet our sales commitments to our smi texas customers in the fourth quarter of  we purchased and rolled billets from other affiliated and unrelated minimills at higher costs 
we subsequently filed a claim with our business interruption insurance carrier 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
overall  the steel minimills recorded million lifo expense in as compared to million in utility expenses increased by million in as compared to electricity increased by million due to both higher usage from increased overall production and rate increases 
natural gas costs increased by million due to higher rates and usage 
costs for ferroalloys and graphite electrodes increased by million and million  respectively  in as compared to largely to more demand from us mills  the impact of the weaker us dollar and higher ocean freight costs on these imported items 

table of contents our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was million during the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of thousand for copper tube selling prices and shipments increased due to stronger demand from residential and commercial customers 
the strong us market in more than compensated for increased foreign imports  alternative competing products such as plastic water tubing  and consolidation among our customers 
our average selling price increased more than our average copper scrap purchase cost resulting in increased metal margins in as compared to the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s prices and costs per pound and operating statistics for the year ended august increase pounds in millions amount pounds shipped pounds produced average selling price average scrap purchase cost average fifo metal margin our copper tube minimill recorded million lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to thousand in cmcz on december   our swiss subsidiary acquired of the outstanding shares of huta zawiercie  sa cmcz  a steel minimill in zawiercie  poland 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
this acquisition greatly expanded our international manufacturing operations 
cmcz recorded net sales of million and an adjusted operating profit of million before minority interests for the year ended august  the factors described above affecting our domestic steel minimills affected cmcz as well  except that it did not benefit from the weaker us dollar 
however  although market conditions remained favorable  the average selling price decreased by during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of due to increased competition 
subsequent to our acquisition  cmcz  in coordination with our international marketing and distribution operation  found new outlets for its products

this acquisition complemented our existing texas rebar fabrication and construction related products sales operations and expanded our service areas in each of the neighboring states 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
lofland accounted for million of the increase in net sales and reported a million adjusted operating loss during subsequent to our acquisition 
lofland recorded a loss primarily because the overall purchase costs from our steel suppliers increased against our selling prices 
lofland s sales prices did not increase as fast as our steel purchase costs because much of our fabrication work was sold months in advance at a fixed price 
however  our domestic fabrication segment s overall adjusted operating profit increased in as compared to due to overall higher average selling prices and shipments 
as progressed  market conditions became increasingly favorable  resulting in higher gross margins in all of our product lines including rebar fabrication  construction related products  steel fence posts  steel joists  castellated beams and structural steel fabrication 
increases in steel purchase costs were more than offset by increased selling prices and shipments 
although construction activity was mixed and varied by region  some private nonresidential construction markets improved and public and institutional construction continued at a solid level enabling us to obtain higher selling prices and increase shipments to meet demand 

table of contents our acquisition of lofland resulted in thousand additional tons shipped 
the table below shows the average fabrication selling prices per short ton excluding stock and buyout sales and total fabrication plant shipments for the years ended august increase amount average fabrication selling price tons shipped in thousands excluding stock and buyout sales 
we recorded million of lifo expense in our domestic fabrication segment for the year ended august   due to the higher cost of steel and more inventories on hand 
during the year ended august   we recorded million of lifo expense 
during the year ended august   we recorded impairment charges of million 
see note  asset impairment charges  to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of the denver  colorado location of symons corporation  el wills in fresno  california and dunn del re steel in chandler  arizona for a total of million 
no single one of these acquisitions was significant to our operations  nor were they significant in the aggregate 
recycling our recycling segment reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared with an adjusted operating profit of million in net sales for the year ended august  were higher at million 
gross margins in were much higher as compared to our selling prices  particularly ferrous scrap  increased significantly because demand from far eastern buyers  especially china  and the weaker us dollar resulted in more scrap exports by our competitors 
in addition  domestic demand for ferrous scrap increased due to high levels of steel production  resulting in higher shipments 
we exported nonferrous scrap to both asia and europe during our sales volumes increased as well  partially due to additional materials that we were able to obtain through our national accounts program directed at the management of scrap for our manufacturing customers 
the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per short ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august increase amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped includes all of our domestic processing plants

our adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
our increased profitability in marketing and distribution was largely the result of our strategy in recent years to build up our regional business around the world and to increase our downstream presence 
the net effect of functional currency fluctuations on our adjusted operating profit was an increase of million 
the remainder of the increases in net sales and adjusted operating profit was due to higher shipments and selling prices in as compared to for all divisions 
the effect of these increases was partially offset by million lifo expense in lifo expense of thousand was recorded in our higher lifo expense was due to increases in both inventory purchase costs and quantities 
markets were favorable in several geographic regions around the world 
our sales increased significantly in the united states and europe 
we imported more steel  aluminum  copper and stainless steel semi finished products into the united states  and gross margins for these products 
table of contents were higher in as compared to also  sales increased for most of our product lines 
sales to and within asia were up significantly  and the economy in australia was still strong

also  our average short term borrowings increased in as compared to to finance additional working capital including our operations in poland 
our overall effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended august  as compared to in  due to the effective tax rate in poland of 
we consider our investment in cmcz to be permanent 
liquidity and capital resources see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
we discuss liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis 
our discussion includes the sources and uses of our five reportable segments and centralized corporate functions 
we have a centralized treasury function and use inter company loans to efficiently manage the short term cash needs of our operating divisions 
we invest any excess funds centrally 
we rely upon cash flows from operating activities  and to the extent necessary  external short term financing sources for liquidity 
our short term financing sources include the issuance of commercial paper  securitization and sales of accounts receivable  documentary letters of credit with extended terms  short term trade financing arrangements and borrowing under our bank credit facilities 
from time to time  we have issued long term public and private debt 
our investment grade credit ratings and general business conditions affect our access to external financing on a cost effective basis 
depending on the price of our common stock  we may realize significant cash flows from the exercise of stock options 
moody s investors service p and standard poor s corporation a rate our million commercial paper program in the second highest category 
to support our commercial paper program  we have an unsecured contractually committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
in may  we renewed and amended our million facility resulting in an increase to million 
our amended facility expires in may we may use million of the program to issue standby letters of credit which totaled million at august  the costs of our revolving credit agreement may be impacted by a change in our credit ratings 
we plan to continue our commercial paper program and the revolving credit agreements in comparable amounts to support the commercial paper program 
also  we have numerous informal  uncommitted  short term credit facilities available from domestic and international banks 
these credit facilities are available to support documentary letters of credit including those with extended terms  foreign exchange transactions and  in certain instances  short term working capital loans 
our long term public debt was million at august  and is investment grade rated by standard poor s corporation bbb and by moody s investors services baa 
we believe we have access to the public markets for potential refinancing or the issuance of additional long term debt 
during the year ended august   we purchased million of our notes otherwise due in  and issued million of notes due november in march  we refinanced the notes payable that we assumed upon the acquisition of cmcz with a five year term note with a group of four banks for million pln million and a revolving credit facility with maximum borrowings of million pln 
in december  we increased our revolving credit facility to million pln million  and in march  we extended this facility by one year 
the term note and the revolving credit facilities are secured by the majority of cmcz assets and contain certain financial 
table of contents covenants 
there are no guarantees by the company or any of its subsidiaries for any of cmcz s debt 
at august   no amount was outstanding on cmcz s revolving credit facility 
in order to facilitate certain trade transactions  we utilize letters of credit  advances and non or limited recourse trade financing arrangements to provide assurance of payments and advance funding to our suppliers 
the letters of credit may be for prompt payment or for payment at a future date  conditional upon the bank finding the documentation presented to be in strict compliance with all terms and conditions of the letter of credit 
our banks issue these letters of credit under informal  uncommitted lines of credit which are in addition to the committed revolving credit agreement 
in some cases  if our suppliers choose to discount the future dated obligation we may absorb the discount cost in order to extend the terms 
credit ratings affect our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financing 
if the rating agencies were to reduce our credit ratings  we would pay higher financing costs and probably would have less availability of the informal  uncommitted facilities 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors 
these factors include earnings  fixed charges such as interest  cash flows  total debt outstanding  off balance sheet obligations and other commitments  total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors 
the rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows  business strategy  industry condition and contingencies 
maintaining our investment grade ratings is a high priority for us 
certain of our financing agreements include various covenants 
our revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants which require that we a not permit our ratio of consolidated long term debt including current maturities to total capitalization defined in our credit agreement as stockholders equity less intangible assets plus long term debt to be greater than to at any time and  b not permit our quarterly ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis to be less than to 
at august   our ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization was to 
our ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense for the year ended august  was to 
in addition  our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell assets  in the case of some of our subsidiaries  guarantee debt  and consolidate or merge 
the indenture governing our long term public debt contains restrictions on our ability to create liens  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  consolidate or merge and limits the ability of some of our subsidiaries to incur certain types of debt or to guarantee debt 
also  our five year term note at cmcz contains certain covenants including minimum debt to ebitda  debt to equity and tangible net worth requirements as defined for cmcz only 
we have more than adequately complied with the requirements  including the covenants of our financing agreements as of and for the year ended august  off balance sheet arrangements for added flexibility  we may secure financing through securitization and sales of certain accounts receivable both in the us and internationally 
see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements 
our domestic securitization program provides for such sales in an amount not to exceed million 
in addition to our domestic securitization program  our european and australian subsidiaries can sell  without recourse  up to million great british pounds gbp and million australian dollars aud of additional accounts receivable 
we may continually sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that have been collected from our customers 
the us securitization program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement  and contains covenants amended in june to conform to the same requirements contained in our amended revolving credit agreement 
we use the securitization program as a source of funding that is not reliant on either our short term commercial paper program or our revolving credit facility 
as such  we do not believe that any reductions in the capacity or termination of the securitization program would materially impact our financial position  cash flows or liquidity because we have access to other sources of external funding 

table of contents our domestic mills  cmcz and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
our capital requirements include construction  purchases of equipment and maintenance capital at existing facilities 
we plan to invest in new operations  use working capital to support the growth of our businesses  and pay dividends to our stockholders 
we continue to assess alternative means of raising capital  including potential dispositions of under performing or non strategic assets 
any future major acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources such as the issuance of common or preferred stock 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
see note  financial instruments  market and credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements 
the volume and pricing of orders from our us customers in the manufacturing and construction sectors affect our cash flows from operating activities 
the pace of economic expansion and retraction of major industrialized and emerging markets especially china outside of the us also significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities 
the weather can influence the volume of products we ship in any given period 
also  the general economy  the strength of the us dollar  governmental action  and various other factors beyond our control influence our volume and prices 
periodic fluctuations in our prices and volumes can result in variations in cash flows from operating activities 
despite these fluctuations  we have historically relied on operating activities as a steady source of cash 
during the year ended august   we generated million of net cash flows from our operating activities as compared to the million of net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the year ended august  our net earnings were million higher for the year ended august  as compared to including the million impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  our accounts receivable and inventories increased million during the year ended august  as compared to an increase in these items of million in accounts receivable for all our segments  except cmcz and recycling  significantly increased in  primarily due to higher selling prices 
higher shipments in our domestic mills  domestic fabrication and marketing and distribution segments were also a factor 
inventories increased primarily in our marketing and distribution segment during the year ended august  due to higher purchase costs and quantities  including goods in transit 
our income taxes payable increased by million during the year ended august  due to higher earnings as compared to our accounts payable increased by million including effects of foreign currency fluctuations of million during the year ended august  due primarily to higher scrap purchases by cmcz in the fourth quarter of also  our accrued expenses and other payables increased by million during the year ended august  as compared to due primarily to increased discretionary incentive accruals  including bonuses and profit sharing 
the increase in our net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended august  as compared to primarily resulted from higher net earnings in which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable significantly increased in all segments in  primarily due to higher selling prices and shipments with the majority of the increases in domestic fabrication  recycling and marketing and distribution 
inventories increased in as compared to primarily due to higher purchase costs and higher inventory quantities in anticipation of increased sales and goods in transit 
we invested million in property  plant and equipment during the year ended august   which was significantly more than during and also  during  we spent million for the acquisitions of substantially all of the operating assets of two fabrication businesses 
during  we spent million of cash for the acquisitions of lofland and cmcz 
we expect our capital spending for fiscal to be million 
we assess our capital spending each quarter and reevaluate our requirements based upon current and expected results 
in november  we issued million of long term notes due in the proceeds from this offering were used to purchase million of our notes otherwise due in and finance our purchases of cmcz and lofland 
in march  we refinanced million of cmcz s notes payable that we had assumed in 
table of contents our acquisition through the issuance of a long term note and a revolving credit facility 
also during  we obtained more extended payment terms through the use of discounted documentary letters of credit rather than through more traditional extended terms with our trade suppliers 
in october  we entered into a trade financing arrangement to enable us to provide a low risk million advance to one of our key suppliers 
the advance was substantially repaid during as the supplier delivered the materials that we purchased under a related supply agreement 
at august    common shares were outstanding and  were held in our treasury 
in january  we paid a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend on our common stock and also increased our quarterly cash dividend to cents per share on the increased number of shares resulting from the stock dividend 
during the year ended august   we received million from stock issued under our employee incentive and stock purchase plans as compared to million in and million in we purchased  shares of our common stock during the year ended august  at per share for a total of million 
during and  we spent million and million  respectively  to acquire our common stock 
we paid dividends of million during the year ended august  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we paid million in long term debt principal when it matured in july we believe that our cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide liquidity during in addition  at august  we had million and million unused capacity under our domestic accounts receivable securitization and commercial paper programs  respectively 
therefore  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our contractual obligations of million over the next twelve months  the majority of which are expenditures associated with normal revenue producing activities and to make our planned capital expenditures of million 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt trade financing arrangement interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
paid in full september interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our customers or suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
all commitments expire within one year 

table of contents in january  we entered into a guarantee agreement to assist one of our chinese coke suppliers to obtain pre production financing from a bank 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at fourteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are 
table of contents involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we believe that our aggregate liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with nine of the fourteen sites will be between million and million 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to estimate the possible range of loss on the other sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these fourteen sites for the year ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources are required to construct what is referred to as the best available control technology 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require all major sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in fiscal  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
business interruption insurance claims and unclaimed property see note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in our fiscal year at the rate of cents per share for the first quarter and cents per share for the last three quarters

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  or  if the transaction involves our australian or european subsidiaries  their local currency 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
interest rates if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt and the fair value of our long term debt would be approximately thousand and million  respectively
