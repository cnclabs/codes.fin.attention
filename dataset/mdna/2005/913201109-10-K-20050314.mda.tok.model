item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the preceding selected consolidated financial and operating information 
additionally  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  as well as other data included in this document  should be read and analyzed in combination with the analysis below 
overview the primary source of the company s net revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments  and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed money 
net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates  customer prepayment patterns  the mix of interest earning assets and the mix of interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the company manages the risk of changes in interest rates on its net interest income through an asset liability committee and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies and practices 
in addition  the company generates revenue through fee based services 
many of these services provide deposits for  or have other synergies with  the core banking operations 
during  the company sold our interest in our clearing operation joint venture  as discussed in item business sale of interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc 
we sold the platform under negotiated terms to our former joint venture partner who intends to grow the overall services provided by matrix settlement and clearance services 
during  the company sold its majority interest in our real estate management and disposition services subsidiary  as discussed in item business sale of majority interest in matrix asset management corporation 
we sold our majority interest because we were concerned that  over an extended period of time  we would be unable to compete in the industry against large real estate title companies who could include the service as part of their total bundled service package 
during  the company sold its wholesale loan origination production platform as discussed in item business discontinued operations 
we sold the platform because we were concerned that  over an extended period of time  we would find it difficult to compete in the highly competitive  lower margin mortgage origination industry  and believe that the synergies provided to our core operations from this line of business were no longer beneficial from an operational risk standpoint 
the company was able to successfully reinvest the liquidity generated by the sale of the production platform without a substantial negative impact on net interest income 
during  we moved our servicing investment to a third party subservicer 
the decision to move the servicing investment was made to lower the overall servicing costs 
in  the company maintained a positive net interest gap  which means that our assets are expected to re price quicker than our liabilities as interest rates change over time 
see a detailed discussion of our strategies to manage our risk in item asset and liability management which follows 
the continuing low interest rate environment in caused continued compression of our net interest margin during much of the year 
the five basis point increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve beginning in june has caused a flattening of the yield curve 
during the same period the longer end of the curve as measured by year fixed rate mortgages has fallen 
as a result  we have again experienced a significant amount of amortization expense on our mortgage servicing rights 
the mortgage servicing rights are amortized based on the expected pattern and life of related servicing revenues and our investment is also evaluated quarterly for impairment 
should the long end of the interest rate curve maintain its current low level  there is a high probability that our mortgage servicing rights will continue to amortize rapidly as borrowers continue to refinance their mortgage loans elsewhere 
if longer term interest rates increase as we expect in  there should be reduced refinance activity in mortgage loans and thus reduced mortgage servicing amortization and possibly a recovery of our recorded impairment 
also  as many of the assets owned by the company are variable rate  increases in longer term rates  will have a positive impact on our net interest margin 
conversely  if interest rates generally decrease from current levels  levels of amortization and impairments could be significant and net interest margin could be compressed further 
certain of our fee based business  including the acquisition  brokerage and sale of sba loans and loan pools  continue to be a strong point in our operations  and in positively impacting our core banking operations 
growth in core deposits continued in  primarily driven by deposits generated by subsidiaries of the company for matrix bank 
we will focus on these businesses and our core banking operations in and beyond 
the following portions of the management s discussion and analysis focus in more detail on the results of operations for  and and on information about the company s balance sheet  credit quality  liquidity and funding resources  capital  critical accounting estimates and other matters 
general matrix bancorp was formed in june when the founding shareholders of matrix financial and united financial  now known as matrix bancorp trading  two of our subsidiaries  exchanged all of their outstanding capital stock for shares of our stock in a series of transactions that were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in september  we acquired dona ana savings and loan association  fsb  which was subsequently renamed matrix capital bank 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we formed matrix asset management corporation  formerly united special services  in june and matrix bancorp trading  formerly matrix capital markets and united capital markets  in december in february  we acquired the vintage group whose primary subsidiary is sterling trust in a pooling of interests and  accordingly  no goodwill was recorded and our consolidated financial statements for the prior periods were restated 
additionally  we acquired abs in march the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we entered into our joint venture  matrix settlement and clearance services  in september of on august   we sold the stock of united capital markets to one of the officers of that company 
on august   matrix financial  our mortgage banking operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix bank 
on october   first matrix  our broker dealer operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix bancorp trading 
on september   we sold our majority interest in matrix asset management corporation  but continued operations of its realty division as mtxc realty corp  and on december   we sold our membership interest in matrix settlement and clearance services 
the principal components of our revenues consist of o net interest income recorded by matrix bank  matrix financial and abs school services  o brokerage and consulting fees generated by matrix bancorp trading and first matrix  o gains on sales of mortgage loans generated by matrix bank and matrix financial  o gains on sales of multifamily and sba loans and pools at matrix bank  o loan administration fees generated by matrix financial  o trust service fees generated by sterling trust and matrix bank  o services fees generated by mtxc realty and our equity earnings under equity method accounting of our minority interest in matrix asset management  llc  and o school service fees generated by abs 
in  included in our revenues were gains on the sale of the matrix bank branches as discussed in item business sale of matrix capital bank branches  gains on the sale of substantially all of the assets of matrix asset management corporation as discussed in item business sale of majority interest in matrix asset management corporation  and gains on the sale of our interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc as discussed in item business sale of interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc 
these gains totaled million 
similar gains are not expected to be as significant source of income prospectively 
our results of operations are influenced by changes in interest rates and the effect of these changes on our interest margins  mortgage loan prepayments and the value of mortgage servicing portfolios 
our fee based businesses are effected to a lesser extent by interest rates and more by competition and general market conditions 
discontinued operations sale of wholesale production platform on september   we announced the final closing  and substantial completion of the sale by matrix financial of substantially all of its assets associated with its wholesale mortgage origination platform 
see item business discontinued operations for a more detailed discussion 
we agreed to sell the platform because we were concerned that  over an extended period of time  we would find it difficult to compete in the highly competitive mortgage origination industry that generally operates on high volume and low margins 
based on the size of our wholesale production platform  we were required to commit a significant percentage of our capital to a line of business that is fairly cyclical and the earnings were difficult for us to predict 
the sale of the platform has allowed us to reduce our operational risks and the costs associated with the platform 
we were successful in reinvesting the liquidity created from the sale into predominately adjustable rate loans  sba loans and high quality mortgage backed securities  thereby reducing the financial impact of being underinvested due to the sale of the production platform 
the operations of the production platform  which reflect income from discontinued operations  net of tax effect  of approximately thousand  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements  and will be presented as such in future releases and filings  and as such are not included in the discussion of results from continuing operations below 
it should be noted the discontinued operations are based upon the company s historical results from operations of the production platform  adjusted to reflect the impact of the sale of the production platform 
because there was an opportunity cost of owning the production platform  the historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that might have occurred if the disposition had actually been completed on the indicated date  and are not indicative of any future results 
the operations of matrix asset management corporation and our investment in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc are reflected in continuing operations and will be reflected as such in future releases and filings 
comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and income loss from continuing operations 
income of million for the fiscal year was recognized  an improvement of million to the loss of million for fiscal year income loss per share from continuing operations was per basic share and per diluted share for the fiscal year  as compared to per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year our income before taxes includes gains recognized on the sale of the retail branches of matrix bank in sun city  arizona and las cruces  new mexico of approximately million  gain on the sale of our majority interest in matrix asset management corporation of million and gain on the sale of our interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc of approximately million 
offsetting a portion of these gains was a charge of approximately million to settle a bankruptcy preference claim  which is further discussed in item legal proceedings  and a charge of approximately million in connection with the transfer of our servicing platform to a third party subservicer  as discussed more fully in item business the subsidiaries matrix financial services corporation 
our loss in was primarily caused by million of amortization of our mortgage servicing asset due to an increase in the prepayment speeds on the loans underlying the mortgage servicing asset caused by the historical low interest rate environment 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased thousand to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year our net interest margin  however  decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   and interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin and the interest rate spread is due to a combination of a basis point decrease in the average rate earned on average interest earning assets to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   while the average balance of interest earning assets increased to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december   reducing the impact of the reduction in rates 
the effects of the decrease in rates on interest earning assets was also offset partially by a decrease in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities of basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   however  our average interest bearing liabilities increased to billion for december  as compared to billion for december  both the decrease in the rate earned on our average interest earning assets  and the decrease in the cost of our average interest bearing liabilities is driven by continued low levels of market interest rates 
the yield earned on our interest earning assets is further impacted by our focus on the acquisition of adjustable rates loans 
for a tabular presentation of the changes in net interest income due to changes in volume of interest earning assets and changes in interest rates  see analysis of changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates and volumes 
provision for loan and valuation losses 
the provision for loan and valuation losses decreased thousand  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was attributable to the procedures followed at matrix bank and matrix financial in the determination of prudently conservative loan valuation balances 
the decrease is consistent with the decline in nonperforming assets that occurred at both entities

loan administration 
loan administration income represents service fees earned from servicing loans for various investors  which are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance plus late fees and other ancillary charges 
loan administration fees decreased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year loan service fees are affected by factors that include the size of our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio  the servicing spread  the timing of payment collections and the amount of ancillary fees received 
our mortgage loan servicing portfolio decreased to an average balance of billion for fiscal year as compared to an average balance of billion for fiscal year the impact of the decrease in the average balance of the servicing portfolio was partially offset by an increase in the average service fee including all ancillary income to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  matrix financial anticipates loan administration fees to continue to decrease as its servicing portfolio decreases through prepayments 
the servicing functions performed by matrix financial were transferred to a third party sub servicer december  we believe that this will allow us to lower our overall cost structure 
loan administration fees are not anticipated to be impacted by this transfer 
brokerage fees 
brokerage fees represent income earned from brokerage and consulting services performed pertaining to mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights and sba trading fees 
brokerage fees decreased slightly by thousand  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this relative consistency was due to increases in revenues generated from the purchasing and sales of servicing assets which rose to million for the year ended december  as compared to thousand for the year ended december   offset by a decline in revenues generated from the whole loan purchasing and sales activities  which decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year these variances are due to market conditions and changes in market demand year to year 
trust services 
trust service fees increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is due to an increase in total trust accounts under administration of  accounts at december  from  accounts at december   and total fiduciary assets under administration which increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the growth was due to increases at matrix bank s trust department  driven by the business referred to us by matrix settlement clearance services  llc 
as noted in item business sale of interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc  the assets and operations of the trust department at matrix bank are in process of being sold to the purchaser of our interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc which is anticipated to close in mid when that sale occurs  our trust services revenues are anticipated to decrease

real estate disposition service revenue increased million  or  between the fiscal years and to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to volume of properties closed and new clients obtained prior to the date of the sale noted above 
as noted above  the sale of our majority interest in matrix asset management corporation is expected to cause real estate disposition services revenues to decrease in gain on sale of loans and securities 
gain on sale of loans and securities decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the gains include gains on sale of repurchased fha and va loans previously sold from our mortgage servicing rights portfolio of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
gains on sale of repurchased fha and va loans relate to delinquent loans that are purchased out of loan pools of which matrix financial acts as servicer and then re sells into the secondary market

other income 
other income  which includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries  income earned on bank owned life insurance  rental income  mortgage servicing net hedging gains and losses and other miscellaneous income items  decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower levels of atm fees which decreased to from thousand for the year ended december   and acceleration of amortization charges recorded through our equity in earnings of our unconsolidated trust preferred securities trusts due to the early call of debt of approximately thousand for the year ended december  these decreases were offset by an increase in income generated and earned up to the date of sale from our equity investment in matrix settlement and clearance  llc  to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  and thousand equity pick up since the date of sale for our minority equity interest in matrix asset management  llc

the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor  among other things  to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of its investment  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of discounted future cash flows 
due to changes in the interest rate environment during the year  among other factors  an impairment recovery was recorded 
in addition  also based on the valuation  a portion of our previously recorded impairment charge was charged off as a permanent impairment against the value of the mortgage servicing rights  reducing the carrying basis to estimated fair value 
it is not possible to estimate if future impairments or recoveries will occur  and further changes in market interest rates  or increases in anticipated future prepayment speeds  may cause additional impairment charges in future periods 
the remainder of noninterest expense  which includes occupancy and equipment expense  postage and communication  professional fees  data processing costs  subaccounting fees and other expenses increased thousand  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily related to increases in subaccounting fees at matrix bank due to increases in the levels of institutional deposits held on which subaccounting services are incurred and the level of fees  which generally move with changes in the targeted fed funds rate 
this increase was offset by an overall decrease in other general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in other general and administrative expense is primarily due to including write downs of real estate at abs and litigation settlements at matrix financial  which are at lower levels that those in  offset by increases in in litigation accruals at matrix bank and repurchase reserves and write offs of receivables at matrix financial due to loans repurchased through representation and warranty provisions related to our discontinued mortgage loan origination business

we constantly attempt to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
we have responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include o increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services and self directed trust services  o purchasing adjustable rate mortgages  o increasing emphasis on the origination of construction  multifamily and commercial real estate lending  including sba loans  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans and generally are at adjustable rates  o acquisition and sales of guaranteed portions of sba loans  which are generally at adjustable rates  o extending the maturity of our interest bearing liabilities by borrowing longer term advances from the fhlbank  o pursuing institutional alliances or depository relationships that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund our investing activities  o focusing on noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to our mortgage servicing rights  and o using matrix bank as the settlement bank for settlement and clearing services offered by sterling trust and matrix settlement clearance services llc to generate deposits 
the strategies outlined have been adhered to over the past several years 
as a result of the strategies  matrix bank is slightly positively gapped  which means that its assets will re price quicker than its liabilities as interest rates fluctuate 
as a result  if interest rates increase  the rising interest rates should have a positive impact on the net interest income 
however  if interest rates remain static or decrease further  or if short term interest rates increase without a comparable increase in long term interest rates  we should experience some compression in our net interest income as certain of our interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities will not re price lower commensurate with declines in asset yields 
due to the historic low interest rate environment  our investment in mortgage servicing rights was unprofitable in and in the current interest rate environment  the investment in mortgage servicing rights will cause the amortization of the investment to remain at higher levels than initially estimated 
due to the sale of the production platform  as discussed in item business discontinued operations  we do not anticipate increasing our investment in mortgage servicing rights  except related to bulk loan purchases at matrix bank 
the servicing function performed by matrix financial was transferred to a third party sub servicer in the fourth quarter of we believe this will allow us to lower our overall cost structure necessitated by the continuing decrease in the mortgage servicing investment 
we will continue to consider several options related to servicing  including strategic sales of the servicing asset 
during  as discussed in item business sale of matrix capital bank branches  we sold our three retail branch locations in las cruces  new mexico and sun city  arizona 
included in the sales were approximately million of retail deposits  and approximately million of loans 
the decision to sell the locations allows us to focus our efforts on generating institutional depository alliances  which we believe is a less expensive funding strategy 
lending activities 
our major interest earning asset is our loan portfolio 
a significant part of our asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of our loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by loan type as of the dates indicated 
the amounts in the table below are shown net of discounts and other deductions 
as of december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential      multifamily  commercial real estate      and commercial school financing      construction      consumer     total loans      less allowance for loan and valuation losses      loans receivable  net      the following table presents the aggregate maturities of loans in each major category of our loan portfolio as of december   excluding the allowance for loan losses 
actual maturities may differ from the maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments or the timing of loan sales 
as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total dollars in thousands residential    multifamily  commercial real estate and commercial     school financing    construction    consumer total loans     loans held for sale  excluding the allowance for loan losses  which are primarily contractually due in less than one to five years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total dollars in thousands fixed     adjustable    total loans     loans held for investment  excluding the allowance for loan losses  which are contractually due in one or more years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total dollars in thousands fixed     adjustable     total loans     nonperforming assets 
as part of asset and liability management  we monitor nonperforming assets on a monthly basis 
nonperforming assets consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual residential mortgage loans      nonaccrual commercial real estate  commercial loans and school financing      nonaccrual consumer loans total nonperforming loans      foreclosed real estate      total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of allowance for loan and valuation losses to total nonperforming loans interest on nonperforming loans not included in interest income    we accrue for interest on government sponsored loans such as fha insured and va guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the majority of the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
nonaccrual residential mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   at december   at december   at december  and at december  the nonaccrual residential mortgage loans have decreased at december  as compared to december  the decrease is due to repayments  reinstatements  foreclosures and sales of delinquent uninsured loans 
due to the low interest rate environment  matrix bank has experienced significantly higher levels of repayments and reinstatements of nonaccrual loans than in prior years 
the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans and school financing at december  as compared to december  is attributable to increase at both abs school financing loans and at matrix bank due primarily to increases in nonaccrual commercial loans  as discussed below 
with regard to our school financing  a majority of our origination of tax exempt financing for charter schools is for the purchase of real estate and equipment 
the balance of these loans in nonaccrual status increased million as compared to december  to million at december  based on current information  we believe that reserves are sufficient for any potential losses 
during the first quarter of  one school client  with whom we had loans in the amount of million  experienced financial difficulties 
of the million balance  million represented a participation sold to a third party with recourse 
during the second quarter of  the million of the loans retained were placed on non accrual status 
the loans were secured by two parcels of real estate 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a revised forbearance agreement  which included the forgiveness of million of loans for a deed in lieu on one of the two parcels 
concurrently  the client entered into a market rate lease agreement on the parcel 
we believe that the market value of the real estate supports the balance of the loan forgiven 
the remaining loan balance of approximately million remains on non accrual 
the client is in compliance with the payment terms of the forbearance agreement and as performance is demonstrated  the loan will be placed on accrual status 
the loan is secured and we believe that there are sufficient reserves and collateral in the case of noncompliance 
during  matrix bank placed three commercial real estate loans that total million at december  on non accrual status 
based on current information  we believe that there are sufficient reserves for any potential loss 
analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for loan and valuation losses for the periods indicated 
the table includes the allowance for both loans held for investment and loans held for sale 
as of and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan and valuation losses  beginning of year      charge offs real estate mortgage    real estate construction commercial loans and school financing   consumer total charge offs      recoveries real estate mortgage commercial loans and school financing consumer total recoveries net charge offs      provision for loan and valuation losses charged to operations      balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans average loans outstanding during the year      to provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit  the company maintains an allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the allowance for loan and valuation losses is analyzed by management as discussed below and is increased by the provision for loan and valuation losses  which is charged to operations  as necessary 
the allowance for loan and valuation losses is calculated  in part  based on historical loss experience 
in addition  management takes into consideration other factors  such as o qualitative evaluations of individual classified assets  o geographic and other portfolio concentrations  o new products or markets  o evaluations of the changes in the historical loss experience component  and o projections of this component into the current and future periods based on current knowledge and conditions 
these loss factors on unclassified assets range from for guaranteed portions of sba loans to for high loan to value uninsured loans that were underwritten to fha guidelines 
the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balance of loans in their respective categories 
loans in the commercial and school finance portfolios are assigned loss factors based on items similar to those listed  plus additional individual loan review on all significant loans  including sba loans  which result in loans being classified as watch  substandard or doubtful 
the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
generally  potential impaired loans owned by the company include only commercial loans  real estate construction loans  commercial real estate mortgage loans  multifamily loans and school financing 
impairment allowances are considered by the company in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
after an allowance has been established for the loan portfolio  management establishes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  which is attributed to factors that cannot be associated with a specific loan or loan portfolio 
the company evaluates its residential loans collectively due to their homogeneous nature 
these factors include o general economic conditions  o recognition of specific regional geographic concerns  o loan type and the assessed risk inherent in each loan category  and o trends in the portfolio and portfolio growth trends 
substandard and doubtful loans of homogeneous loan portfolios are assigned loss factors of to  if not measured for impairment 
the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balances of loans in their respective categories 
the total for all categories as described above determines our allowance for loan and valuation losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when the probability of collection is considered remote 
the following table shows information regarding the components of our allowance for loan and valuation losses as of the dates indicated as of december  percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage of loans of loans of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each in each in each category to category to category to category to category to total total total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans dollars in thousands residential      multifamily  commercial real estate and commercial      school financing      construction consumer the ratio of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to total loans was at december   at december   at december   at december  and at december  the allowance for loan and valuation losses is reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the balance of the allowance for loan and valuation losses allocated to residential has increased  despite a decrease in the balance of these loans in nonaccrual status  due to the increase in the overall principal amount of residential loans outstanding at december  the balance of loan and valuation losses allocated to multifamily  commercial real estate  commercial  school financing and construction loans has increased due to increases in these type loans in nonaccrual status  despite an overall decrease in the outstanding loan principal balances in these categories 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb estimated probable current losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of our operations and ultimate success is partially dependent upon our ability to manage our interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although we manage other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its mortgage servicing rights 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the mortgage servicing rights  which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster  which reduces future servicing income  in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
we currently classify our sba pooled securities as trading 
because the securities are all prime based  and have historically traded in very high trading ranges even in a changing interest rate environment  the securities should maintain limited market risk 
the majority of our residential loan portfolio is held for sale  which requires us to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of aggregate cost or market 
therefore  we continually monitor the interest rates of our loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
the asset and liability committee establishes policies that monitor and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the asset and liability committee is also involved in formulating our budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
we have engaged a third party to provide consulting services to assist us with our asset liability management 
we meet with this consulting firm quarterly to monitor the interest rate risk position and to analyze and discuss strategies related to asset liability management 
we anticipate that we will continue to engage this consulting firm on a quarterly basis to perform quarter end models of interest rate risk and asset liability positions and will use our internal modeling to support asset liability decisions 
we continue to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  we focus on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and have increased our efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  multifamily loans  commercial real estate loans and sba loans  which re price or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
we also purchase with the intent to sell as pooled securities the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
again  the loans generally adjust with prime and present very little interest rate risk 
the risk associated with the guaranteed sba loans acquired resides with the significant premium paid for the loans 
the other significant asset that in the past we have invested in is residential mortgage servicing rights 
the value and cash flows from residential mortgage servicing rights respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of fixed rate mortgages decrease  in turn decreasing net interest income  the value of the mortgage servicing rights increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
it is important to note  however  that an equal increase or decrease in interest rates will not affect the value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio equally 
a decrease in interest rates causes a greater reduction in the value of the portfolio as compared to the increase in value in the portfolio from an equal increase in interest rates 
the scenario discussed of decreasing interest rates is what occurred in and the interest rate environment in remained at historically low levels 
in response to the low interest rates  we experienced continued significant runoff in our servicing portfolio 
due to the volatility of the value of mortgage servicing  we do not anticipate significantly increasing our investment in to the contrary  we expect our overall investment in to again decrease through prepayment and normal amortization 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of our mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than we projected for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the mortgage servicing rights may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  we initiated a hedging program on a portion of our investment 
in  based on our analysis of the servicing investment  we removed our hedge of mortgage servicing rights 
in  we may sell portions of our mortgage servicing portfolio as the opportunity presents itself  and continue to reduce our overall investment in this asset 
another significant strategy that we focus on in managing interest rate risk is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in mortgage servicing rights  which generate no cost escrow deposits  sterling trust s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs  and our previous investment in matrix settlement and clearance services llc that uses  or its clients use  matrix bank as the clearing bank and custodian  which creates low cost deposits 
after the sale of our interest in matrix settlement and clearance services llc  they are continuing to use matrix bank as the clearing bank and custodial  and thus we are able to maintain the level of the deposits 
see item business sale of interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  llc 
with regards to our interest sensitive liabilities in order to maintain our net asset sensitive interest rate gap and extend the average lives of our interest bearing liabilities  matrix bank has acquired short option agreements and longer term fixed rate advances from the fhlbank to years totaling million at december   which have interest rates ranging from to 
many of these liabilities were acquired several years ago  however  matrix bank acquired million of such liabilities during to years at rates from to 
it is anticipated that our interest margin will benefit in the long term as interest rates increase 
short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we rely heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowings are the fhlbank for matrix bank  third party credit facility for abs  and the revolving portion of the bank stock loan for matrix bancorp 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following table sets forth a summary of our short term borrowings during  and and as of the end of each such period average weighted amount amount maximum average outstanding outstanding outstanding interest weighted at during the at any rate during average interest year end year month end the year year end dollars in thousands at or for the year ended december  fhlbank borrowings    school financing    at or for the year ended december  fhlbank borrowings    revolving lines of credit   school financing    at or for the year ended december  fhlbank borrowings    revolving lines of credit    school financing    calculations are based on daily averages where available and monthly averages otherwise 
a total of million of the fhlbank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under short option advance agreements with the fhlbank 
the interest rates on the short option advance borrowings ranged from to at december  and their possible call dates varied from january to november a total of million of the fhlbank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under fixed rate advance agreements with the fhlbank 
the interest rates on the advances ranged from to at december   and their maturity dates ranged from november to may additionally  million of the fhlbank borrowings outstanding at december  are fixed term rate advances  which were borrowed from the fhlbank to offset specific loans originated by matrix bank

the interest rate on the fixed term rate advances was  and their maturity date is june liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy disbursement needs  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
to date  our principal source of funding for our investing activities has been o the issuance of junior subordinated debentures through matrix bancorp capital trust i in  matrix bancorp capital trust ii  iii and iv in and matrix bancorp capital trust v in and matrix bancorp capital trust iv in  o the issuance of subordinated debt offering in february  o secured senior debt provided by unaffiliated financial institutions  o the issuance of senior notes in september  paid in full september  o a bank stock loan  and o our initial public offering 
as of december   matrix bancorp had million in indebtedness outstanding 
the borrowed funds have been used historically as capital injections to matrix bank  matrix financial  matrix bancorp trading and abs 
in march  matrix bancorp amended its bank stock loan agreement 
the amended bank stock loan agreement has two components  an million term loan and a revolving line of credit of million 
as of december   the balance of the term loan was million and the balance of the revolving line of credit was the amended bank stock loan requires matrix bancorp to maintain total shareholders equity of million 
matrix bank is required to maintain classified assets of less than of total assets  and must also earn in excess of million over the previous four quarters as of the end of each fiscal quarter from june  forward 
the covenants must be met quarterly 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
the term loan has a maturity date of december  the revolving line of credit is annually renewed and currently has a maturity date of march  we are in the process of renewing the revolving line of credit 
note  however  there can be no assurances that the bank stock loan will be renewed or any terms modified  or any new revolving line of credit facilities entered into 
the company has sponsored six trusts  matrix bancorp capital trusts i through vi  of which of the common equity is owned by the company 
the trusts were formed for the purposes of issuing corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities the capital securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of such capital securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the company 
the debentures held by each trust are the sole assets of that trust 
distributions on the capital securities issued by each trust are payable either quarterly or semiannually at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate being earned by the trust on the debentures held by that trust 
the capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the debentures 
the company has entered into agreements which  taken collectively  fully and unconditionally guarantee the capital securities subject to the term of each of the guarantees 
see details and further discussion of these trusts included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the company issued million of subordinated debt with a ten year maturity 
the interest rate adjusts quarterly based on the day libor at a margin of 
interest payments are to be made quarterly 
generally  the debt covenants are no less restrictive than the capital trusts discussed below 
the net proceeds were used to satisfy the full repayment of the senior notes discussed in the following paragraph which matured in september on september   we completed a registered debt offering of million in senior notes due in september  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes matured on september  and were paid in full at that time 
in august  matrix bancorp capital trust vi trust vi  a delaware business trust formed by matrix bancorp  completed the sale of million of preferred securities 
trust vi also issued common securities to the company  and used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures of matrix bancorp due october  the interest rate is fixed through october  at which time it will reset to a variable rate of three month libor plus 
the preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly at an annual rate of of the stated liquidation amount of thousand per preferred security 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of trust vi under the preferred securities 
the guarantee covers the quarterly distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the preferred securities  but only to the extent of funds held by trust vi 
the preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the junior subordinated debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture 
the company has the right to redeem the junior subordinated debentures  in whole or in part  on or after october   at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
proceeds raised were used to partially redeem trust preferred securities of capital trust i  discussed below 
on september   the company announced the partial redemption of the cumulative trust preferred securities issued by matrix bancorp capital trust i in july of the company redeemed an aggregate amount of million of the trust preferred and common securities in the amount of for each trust preferred security  plus accumulated and unpaid distributions through the redemption date  which was october  the trend of net cash used by our operating activities experienced over the reported periods results primarily from the growth at matrix bank and regular operating activities 
the trend of net cash used by operations is dependent upon the company s decision to retain matrix bank s earnings at matrix bank and leverage the earnings by increasing its interest earning assets through the purchase of primarily residential mortgage loans 
in the future  we believe the trend of net cash used will decrease as the company s intent is to resume matrix bank s historical dividend policy and thus to retain less than of the earnings of matrix bank at matrix bank 
however  the retention of less earnings will not support the same level of growth as occurred in also  we expect anticipated decreases in use of cash from the cost reductions that should be realized from  among other items  the transfer of the servicing asset at matrix financial to a sub servicer  as well as continued return of capital committed to abs through dividends to matrix bancorp as the loans receivable continue to be liquidated under a strategy adopted in the company is reliant on dividend and tax payments from its subsidiaries in order to fund operations  meet debt and tax obligations and grow new or developing lines of business 
a long term inability of a subsidiary to make dividend payments could significantly impact the company s liquidity 
historically  the majority of the dividend payments have been made by matrix bank 
due to the success experienced by certain of the fee based subsidiaries of matrix bancorp and the gains generated on the sale of our majority interest in matrix asset management corporation and our interest in matrix settlement and clearance services llc as discussed in item business  dividends were also paid by these subsidiaries to the company 
as a result of the liquidity generated  matrix bank did not pay a dividend to the company in the current dividend policy approved by matrix bank is of the consolidated cumulative earnings of matrix bank 
the current dividend policy approved by matrix bancorp trading and first matrix is of the earnings of those subsidiaries 
absent these dividend payments  the company intends to utilize the line of credit on its bank stock loan  as needed  to meet its own and the other subsidiaries financial obligations 
additionally  it is anticipated that during  as was experienced in  a portion of the capital that was committed to abs will be returned through dividends to matrix bancorp from abs as the loans receivable at abs are liquidated under a strategy adopted in the timing and amounts of this liquidation cannot be determined with certainty at this time  but are anticipated to provide additional liquidity to the company during matrix bank s primary source of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are o trust deposits  o fhlbank borrowings  o brokered deposits  o custodial escrow balances  o other institutional wholesale and retail deposits  o sales of loan portfolios and investment securities  and o proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities 
contractual loan payments and net deposit inflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the fhlbank as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had overnight and term borrowings from the fhlbank of million 
the availability of fhlbank borrowings is based on the level of collateral pledged 
generally  the availability will be limited based on eligible collateral pledged or of total assets 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios and the timing of payments for taxes and insurance  as well as the level of prepayments which occurs 
for a tabular presentation of the our short term borrowings  see asset and liability management short term borrowings 
matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
matrix bank s retail deposits principally consist of demand deposits and certificates of deposit 
the flow of deposits is influenced by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
matrix bank s retail deposits were previously obtained primarily from the branches in sun city  arizona and las cruces  new mexico 
as noted in item business sale of matrix bank branches those branches were sold in  including approximately million of retail deposits  which represented approximately of our average interest bearing liabilities 
the sale of the branches is not expected to have a significant impact on the liquidity at matrix bank 
other funding sources discussed will be utilized to replace the deposits 
on a continuing basis  traditional retail deposits will be generated from the area surrounding the denver  colorado location  but are not anticipated to be a significant portion of our liquidity 
brokered deposits are accepted and have been utilized to support growth and maintenance of liquidity at matrix bank 
in pricing deposit rates  management considers profitability  the matching of term lengths with assets  the attractiveness to customers and rates offered by competitors 
matrix bank intends to continue its efforts to attract deposits from commercial and wholesale sources as a primary source of funds to support its lending and investing activities

abs school services principal source of funding for school financing consists of its internal capital  sales of loans to third party institutions and partnership trusts with unaffiliated financial institutions 
amounts available to be sold and amounts to be financed are at the purchaser s and lender s sole discretion 
one of our facilities maintained at a third party institution matured in september cash proceeds generated from the sale or refinancing of the underlying loans used as collateral for the financing were used to repay the maturing facility 
the second facility which currently has an outstanding balance of approximately million matures in september of we are in the process of renewing the facility 
however  there can be no assurances that such facility will be renewed 
we do not anticipate significantly increasing our current loan portfolio 
under a purchase and sale agreement  abs has sold school financings to an unaffiliated financial institution  with full recourse to abs 
abs services the school financings on a scheduled scheduled remittance and in the case of a loss or default  upon the liquidation of the underlying collateral  abs is required to reimburse the unaffiliated financial institution for any shortfall 
due to the control the unaffiliated financial institution has over the school financing  the transaction was accounted for as a sale 
the recourse provisions were considered by us at the time of the sale 
no gain or loss was booked at the sale date as the loans were sold at their carrying value 
the total balance of the school financings sold with recourse is million at december  matrix bank and sterling trust are restricted in certain instances from paying dividends to matrix bancorp due to certain regulatory requirements 
see item business regulation and supervision 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  we are from time to time party to various litigation matters  in most cases  involving ordinary routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
with respect to all pending litigation matters  our ultimate legal and financial responsibility  if any  cannot be estimated with certainty 
as such  the impact on our liquidity and capital cannot be estimated with certainty  and  an adverse decision in certain matters  as described in item legal proceedings  may have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated liquidity or capital 
with regard to the adderley case at sterling trust discussed in item legal proceedings  it was noted that the court of appeals for the second district of texas fort worth affirmed a portion of the jury s award for the plaintiffs and against sterling trust for actual damages of million  plus post judgment interest and conditional attorneys fees for the appeals 
we also noted that we appealed this decision to the supreme court of texas 
the supreme court of texas agreed to hear the appeal of sterling trust  and on september   oral argument was held before the supreme court of texas 
notwithstanding the fact that the supreme court of texas has heard this appeal by sterling trust  no assurances can be given that the appeal will be successful or that the supreme court of texas will render an opinion favorable to sterling trust 
if we are unsuccessful in this appeal  and if we elect to contribute the capital to sterling trust to pay the judgment  there would be a significant impact on the liquidity of the company

the rights will expire on november  inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company and its subsidiaries have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are value in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the company currently views the determination of the allowance for loan and valuation losses as a critical accounting policy that requires significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios  which represent the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three components  pools of homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics  individually significant loans  often classified  that are measured for impairment and a component representing estimated probable inherent but undetected losses  which also contemplates the imprecision in the credit risk models utilized to calculate the allowance 
pools of homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics are assessed for probable losses 
matrix bank performs a quarterly loss migration analysis and loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience 
the analysis also examines historical loss experience and the related internal gradings of loans charged off 
the loss migration analysis considers inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio 
these losses may arise due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
this component of the allowance also considers inherent imprecision in the loan loss migration models 
the company has expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish allocation estimates may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical loss factors used may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
the portion of the allowance established for loans measured for impairment reflects expected credit losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all significant loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the last component of the allowance for loan losses is a portion which represents the estimated probable inherent but undetected losses  and the imprecision in the credit risk models utilized to calculate the allowance 
this component of the reserve is not associated with any particular loan type and is reflective of the uncertainty surrounding general economic conditions and ongoing uncertainty with respect to a small number of individually large loans 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale 
the company also considers its lower of cost or market valuations which apply to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale to be a critical accounting policy that requires use of judgments  assumptions and estimates 
our mortgage servicing portfolio does not trade in an active open market with readily observable market prices 
although sales of mortgage servicing rights do occur  the exact terms and conditions may not be readily available 
as such  mortgage servicing rights are established and valued in accordance with sfas using discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates  discount rates  servicing costs  and other economic factors 
the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the value of mortgage servicing rights asset 
increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced 
in determining the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights  mortgage interest rates  which are used to determine prepayment rates  and discount rates are held constant over the estimated life of the portfolio 
expected mortgage loan prepayment rates are derived from a third party model and may be adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the company s portfolio 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount  net of accumulated amortization  or fair value 
management compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and believes that the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants 
the company has recorded impairment reserves and recoveries of such reserves based on the market conditions and the valuation analysis 
although management believes its process for determining the impairment reserve required adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in declines in value of the mortgage servicing rights  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for impairment could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the company classifies a majority of its loan assets as held for sale 
loans held for sale are required to be carried at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
many of the loans owned by the company either do not trade in an active market or trade in inefficient markets 
as such  the market value of loans without available market prices is estimated by loan type using interest rates for reasonably comparable assets found in the secondary marketplace 
other factors including delinquency  existence of government guarantees  and other economic factors are considered in estimating the fair value of loans held for sale 
management compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and believes the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants 
a rising interest rate environment could possibly result in declines in the market value of the loans held for sale  which could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the company mitigates risk associated with declines in the estimated fair value of its loans held for sale by predominately holding loans with variable interest rates that are less market sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  in management is considering the use of derivative instruments to hedge the change in value or cash flows from loans due to changes in interest rates 
litigation 
the company also considers the judgments and assumptions concerning litigation as a critical accounting policy 
the company has been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings 
most of these cases involve ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
see a full description of such proceedings at item legal proceedings 
with respect to all pending litigation matters  our ultimate legal responsibility  if any  cannot be estimated with certainty 
based on the ultimate outcome of such proceedings  it is possible that future results of operations and financial position for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to such proceedings 
any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this financial review
