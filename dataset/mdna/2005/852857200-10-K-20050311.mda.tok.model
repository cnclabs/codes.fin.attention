revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
service fee revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenue  service fee revenue decreased percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in service fee revenue is primarily due to the increase in the size of the customer base 
furthermore  during the fiscal year our customer base included a greater percentage of power plan customers compared to fiscal year this resulted in higher service fee revenues per customer 
the decrease in service fee revenue as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the addition of revenue from our new photostamps product 
as of december   power plan customers accounted for of total registered customers as compared to at the end of december  we expect our service fee revenue to again increas e in future periods as we convert our simple plan customers to the power plan and as we add to our customer base

in addition  in may  the company received approximately million shares million shares prior to the reverse split of the company s common stock from john payne  the former ceo of the company  as payment in full of a promissory note executed in november between mr 
payne and the company 
the company retired those shares in the quarter ended september   and this resulted in an additional approximately re duction in the shares outstanding balance from the balance at the end of april the company will consider repurchasing shares of its common stock throughout the current month repurchase program by evaluating such factors as the price of the stock  the daily trading volume  the availability of large blocks of stock  and any additional constraints it might have because of material inside information it may possess 
in january  our board of directors declared a return of capital cash dividend of per share  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february   which was paid on february  based on   shares after the reverse split in may common shares outstanding  less treasury stock of approximately   shares after the reverse split on the date of record  february   the total cash dividend was approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from the decrease in legal expenditures and by increased revenues and expanding gross margins and operating cash flow 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the sale of investments to fund the return of capital cash dividend in february net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the return of capital cash dividend paid in february we believe our available cash and marketable securities  together with the cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was originally effective on july  in december  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to march  for interests held by public companies in variable interest entities or potential variable entities created before february  we have completed our evaluation of the provisions of fin and we do not have any significant interests in variable interest entities 
accordingly  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or the results of operations 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
chapter 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage  requiring these items to be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during the fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we estimate the adoption of statement r may result in an increase to operating expenses in the amount of million for the year ended december  however  this estimate may vary as it will depend on factors such as the level of share based payments granted in the future 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operation cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were in  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and investments are comprised of money market  us government obligations and public corporate debt securities with weighted average maturities of days at december  our cash equivalents and investments  net of restricted cash  approximated million and had a related weighted average interest rate of approximately 
interest rate fluctuations impact the carrying value of the portfolio 
we do not believe that the future market risks related to the above securities will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity
