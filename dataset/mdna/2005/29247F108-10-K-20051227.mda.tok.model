references made in this annual report on form k to en pointe technologies  en pointe  the company  we  us  or our refer to en pointe technologies  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  en pointe technologies sales  inc  en pointe technologies canada  inc  en pointe gov  inc formerly en pointe technologies ventures  inc  and  the xyphen corporation dba contentware 
en pointe technologies and the building blocks design are registered trademarks of the company and are mentioned or referred to in this annual report 
item business general en pointe technologies  inc was originally incorporated in texas on january  and reincorporated in delaware on february  we are a national provider of information technology products hardware and software and value added services with a customer base consisting primarily of large and medium sized companies and government entities 
we use proprietary and non proprietary software and systems to drop ship information technology products to our customers through an electronically linked network of suppliers that include distributors and certain manufacturers in the united states 
this software allows us to serve as an electronic clearinghouse of computers and computer related products without many of the risks and costs associated with maintaining significant inventory 
in addition to seeking efficiencies and growth in our traditional large enterprise focused core business  we continue to devote resources to the development of our managed and professional services infrastructure 
en pointe is represented in approximately sales and service markets throughout the united states  and maintains a value added iso certified integration operation in ontario  california 
we provide our customers with cost effective electronic commerce tools that help them to maximize their purchasing power when searching for and acquiring computer equipment and other technology products 
one of our available tools  accesspointe tm  is a uniquely powerful and flexible internet procurement system that is electronically linked to the extensive warehousing  purchasing and distribution functions of our suppliers 
accesspointe tm provides ease of use  real time accuracy  and the power to control the purchasing process  from paperless requisition creation to line item detail delivery tracking 
the direct links to our suppliers enhance our capacity to provide our customers with automated direct access to an extensive range of products at competitive prices 
business model our business model covers hardware and software fulfillment and value added services 
hardware fulfillment extends beyond efficient delivery to include pre deployment services that we perform prior to shipment  including imaging and image management  configurations  asset tagging  inventory management and master packing 
the procurement process is vital to hardware fulfillment and we try to make this process as efficient as possible for our customers 
value added services include ongoing managed services such as management of information technology infrastructure as well as professional services that provide specific 
table of contents information technology solutions for our customers 
software fulfillment includes presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
the hardware fulfillment business relies on our virtual inventory model that has been developed and enhanced over time  but since our inception in  our core concepts have remained the same 
the virtual inventory model s essential elements are i a low cost overhead structure resulting from the automation of many management and operating functions  ii effective electronic information systems  and iii reduced working capital requirements due to the limited amount of physical inventory that we hold and our allied distributor relationships 
our highly sophisticated and customized enterprise resource planning system  referred to as sap  allows us to monitor sales  product returns  inventories  profitability and accounts receivable at the sales representative and customer level 
additionally  we have integrated product purchasing and customer invoicing into our information systems to expedite procurement and billing 
accesspointe tm  an ebusiness platform  provides us and our customers with up to date product information and streamlines the procurement process 
the completely integrated ebusiness information technology architecture helps us maintain effective online communication links with our sales representatives  selected suppliers  and many of our customers 
accesspointe tm is provided free of charge to our customers to better enable them to execute transactions and research their orders online with us 
we continue to focus on cost control and strive to maintain a low cost overhead structure through the automation of many of our management and operating functions 
in fiscal  we introduced another low cost overhead element to our business model by relocating many of our back office functions to service providers in islamabad  pakistan 
the day to day customer support function is shared between a centralized staff at headquarters  back office contract workers in pakistan  and local account management to improve field response yet maintain direct access to all back office functions and senior management 
increased local coverage has fueled efforts to identify new opportunities 
we believe that time in front of customers is the top priority for all account managers  account executives  and senior management to build long lasting relationships and identify business solutions for existing and new customers 
our product sales are conducted principally from both traditional branch offices which are located in approximately metropolitan markets in states 
our service business is offered nationally and is managed and staffed by our in house technicians using  when necessary  limited engagements of contracted third party service providers 
we believe in seeking out new markets wherever there is a business case to support the incurring of additional personnel expense or whenever specific account opportunities arise 
we have been and continue to be  since may   certified as a minority controlled company by the national minority supplier development council 
the certification is considered valuable because many large buying organizations  private enterprise accounts and state and local government agencies have supplier diversity initiatives that may require certain purchases to be made from certified minority controlled companies 
an integral component of our business model is our ability to access an extensive inventory of information technology products stocked by our suppliers through our integrated supply chain information systems that are key features of accesspointe tm 
additionally  the intelligent purchasing feature of our software allows our purchasing department to place multiple line item orders automatically from multiple sources at the lowest possible price  maximizing the fill rate and increasing the potential profitability on each order 
the data provided by our customized information system allows our sales representatives to design each customer s orders according to their particular needs 
product can be delivered directly from suppliers to the customer or processed through our configuration facility located in ontario  california 
we simplify the ordering  staging  and delivery process through supply chain management for any size order 
our configuration facility is located close to our major suppliers warehouse locations for convenient same day pick up of orders 
this provides the configuration facility with the flexibility to meet stringent service level agreements and still function economically by limiting inventory to customer ordered product 
once our configuration facility tests and loads systems with predefined customer images  systems are then shipped ready to install  saving customers money in downstream deployment costs 
just in time configuration is well supported by our information system that identifies which of our suppliers can supply the desired product at the best price when needed from different products offered from multiple suppliers 

table of contents a distinct advantage of our business model is the economy achieved by the conservation of working capital through leveraging our virtual inventory model that engages the extensive warehousing  purchasing  distribution  marketing and information technology functions of our suppliers 
since inception  we have been an innovator in using the drop shipping capabilities of our suppliers whenever product configuration is not required 
drop shipping avoids the costs and risks associated with maintaining inventory  enabling us to quickly adapt our product offerings to changing market demands 
as product proliferation has occurred  our limited inventory position has given us a competitive advantage with respect to price and availability on a broad range of products 
we believe our business model allows us to have the capacity to increase sales with minimal additional capital investment 
the value added services include managed services that usually involve multi year desktop and server support contracts for specified periods of time 
we provide such services to several large national accounts by dedicated on site resources trained and certified to provide network operations support  installations  moves  adds  changes  desktop and server support  and break fix services 
we also offer an array of value added professional services that include needs assessment  design solutions  deployment and post deployment support  and help desk for our customers 
in addition  we provide at our iso certified integration facility configuration services  including hardware configuration  software installation and custom imaging services  testing  aggregation  and asset tagging 
whether customers buy their products from us or others  we can provide them with extensive logistics support 
in support of that growing part of our business  during the later half of fiscal  we completed the development of the logistics management system  or lms  software program 
the lms program is integrated with sap and allows us to more efficiently work with our customers and common carriers 
the lms program s single system environment has the capability to manage and track logistic activities  providing customers with detailed asset reporting as well as asset life cycle management 
the lms program has the following benefits overall customer project planning  detailed planning and scheduling of customer assets to be serviced  receipt confirmation of customer assets and subsequent tracking ability  periodic detailed customer asset reporting by serial number  and management of customer life cycle process to include reconditioning and packaging  redeployment  liquidation  identification of leased assets and compliance with lease terms  and work order history by serial number of each customer asset 
the software licensing business employs highly skilled personnel to provide comprehensive solutions to customers needing software solutions 
this specialized group provides value to customers in their presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
although we have been for several years an authorized microsoft large account reseller as well as an authorized agent for many other software publishers  we had not fully developed the operational and system capabilities to expand sales opportunities 
in early fiscal year  recognizing that need  we began the process of enhancing the capabilities of sap and accesspointe tm to improve upon presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
upon completion of the software upgrades in june  we now believe that we have a more efficient software selling process that has produced and will continue to produce noticed improvements for our customers ordering and maintenance needs 
to accomplish the software improvements  we hired additional personnel and contracted with an 
table of contents indian based privately held firm 
cost to develop the program was approximately million and provides the following benefits maintains software agreements for all major software publishers  incorporates a dynamic data model that simplifies reporting processes to allow improved identification of customer trends  sales opportunities  and customer milestones  provides real time product configuration that reduces time for sales reps to identify customer requested software products  restricts the data entry to a structured format that ensures adherence to vendor and publisher rules  thereby avoiding the costly retroactive correction of errors in processing  manages software agreements to offer customers the ability to purchase software more efficiently by increasing their awareness of software agreement terms  purchasing history  and needs  identifies software products for compliance with customer software agreements  allows stricter service level agreements to be met by reducing turnaround time for quotes and orders  and manages licensing agreements assuring customers are quoted and sold products in accordance with their existing agreements 
ebusiness we offer competitive advantages for our customers through use of modern information technologies  and inventive business processes 
by use of our virtual inventories and online procurement and service solutions we leverage technology to enable our business model 
we begin by employing enterprise resource planning  or erp  technology via an sap based system that maintains our operational and financial processes within a structure that provides for flexibility with full executive control and accountability 
this system forms the core of our organization and maintains control over every transaction whether with vendors or customers 
reporting  decision support  inventory  and logistic management are some of the key functions of our erp system that have been customized to offer a broad range of services including  order processing through our virtual inventory  customized configuration orders  customer logistic and disposal management  software license management as well as back office accounting for our professional services 
to make business transactions with us easy and intuitive  we have created our online internet based application accesspointe tm dedicated toward advancing our e business by using solutions that provide for integration with each customer s applications and unique procurement processes 
accesspointe tm provides customers with a complete life cycle procurement solution that helps put customers in control of their organization s spending practices and standardizes their information technology selections 
accesspointe tm does this by providing customer based approval workflow as well as allowing customers to encourage or enforce ordering for certain products over others 
accesspointe tm provides the capability for customers to have highly customized views of our product catalog by restricting products they don t want to order 
with accesspointe tm  customers can do real time searches for product availability from our vendors 
accesspointe tm provides confidence that our customers transactions will be secure and private  and can integrate with other information technology online marketplaces 
our professional and managed service teams employ tools that allow customers to monitor the progress of our service engagements  and to have service dispatch and reports available to other customer systems to ensure the services we provide are coordinated with all other customer processes and departments 
these tools can provide online status of open or scheduled service work  report outstanding items  integrate with customer systems  and allow our customers to partner with us 
in addition to our main systems  we have ancillary systems that automate our internal processing of transactions 
these tools and application solutions allow us to create custom information technology product and service catalogs for our customers and also provide capabilities to integrate with customer order and 
table of contents payment processes within our distributor network 
these solutions are flexible enough to allow us to not only manage content from any number of vendors but to also be able to provide data management services daily to select customers and support custom order integration with customers with complex and unique ordering needs 
managed and professional services we provide a full range of information technology life cycle services  including the following needs assessment  solution design  image development  configuration  deployment  system refresh and disposal services  post deployment support  help desk  maintenance  and asset management 
we employ best practices to provide high quality  low cost service solutions that address client information technology infrastructure needs  from the desktop to the wide area network 
a team dedicated to sales of services complements the larger general sales staff to uncover opportunities within existing accounts and to seek new business for the three fiscal years ended in  net sales from services provided  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
we have historically focused more on our managed services business than our professional services opportunities because managed services usually involve multi year desktop and server support contracts for specified periods of time 
these engagements typically result in relatively consistent revenue streams that enable us to make strategic long term investments to expand our service offerings and organizational infrastructure 
professional services  on the other hand  tend to require higher levels of investment without the relative predictability of managed services agreements 
we provide managed services to large national accounts by dedicated on site staff trained and certified to provide installations  moves  adds  changes  desktop and server support  and break fix services 
we do our own technical recruiting for these positions  to better control the quality of our staff and to provide timely and cost competitive alternatives suitable for the varying skill and or geographic requirements of our customers 
as an integral part of some of our managed services  we provide storage of inventory for customers at our ontario configuration and logistics center 
seven large customers accounted for approximately of our total service revenues for the fiscal year as compared to approximately for the fiscal year 
our enterprise help desk services are offered either on site at the customer location or through our centralized call center 
we maintain a technically trained staff that resolves problems during the initial phone call  thereby decreasing customer down time and increasing end user productivity 
this also reduces the need to dispatch technicians for on site visits  which reduces the overall costs of customer support 
included in our professional service offerings are desktop and server design  messaging  storage  wireless  broadband and other network support  and security 
with system security being of such concern  we are requiring our engineers and consultants to become security certified 
we plan that service engagements offered by us will include a security focus that will differentiate our professional services offerings from those of our competitors while we have not invested significantly in this area relative to our managed services  customer demand for these services appears to be increasing and we will respond to opportunities when we can leverage our existing infrastructure or when it complements an existing customer support agreement 

table of contents one area in which we continue to expand is in offerings to customers of return on investment consulting 
we assist customers to maximize the return on their information technology investment dollars by moving to new hardware platforms  consolidating servers and storage  and efficiently managing human resources with our expertise in active directory  a microsoft program that allows organizations to manage information about network resources and users 
we also have helped customers implement technologies that allow them to fix end users computers remotely  without having to dispatch an onsite engineer  and compute for our customers the savings they realize by minimizing their down time 
we use clarify  an industry leading customer relationship management system  to create and track our service calls and to manage service parts 
this system measures and reports initial response times  on site arrival times  and call closure or resolution times 
from voluminous call ticket data  this system compiles and calculates the corresponding service levels so that we can be measured against industry standards  our company objectives  and customer commitments 
this enables us to improve our processes to achieve greater levels of customer satisfaction 
products the majority of our sales are information technology products 
we currently make available to our customers an extensive selection of products at what we believe to be a competitive combination of price and availability 
we currently offer over  information technology products from hundreds of manufacturers  including international business machines corporation ibm  hewlett packard company hp  dell computer corporation dell  cisco systems  inc  fujitsu limited  apple computer  inc  com corporation  microsoft corporation microsoft  toshiba corporation  kingston technology corporation  lexmark international  inc  sony corporation  symantec corporation  avaya  inc  altiris  inc 
and nortel networks corporation 
we are also one of a limited number of microsoft certified large account resellers 
products that we offer include desktop and laptop computers  servers  monitors  memory  peripherals and accessories  operating systems  application software  consumables and supplies 
in fiscal  products manufactured by hp accounted for approximately of our product sales in terms of revenue  while products manufactured by dell  ibm and microsoft together represented approximately of our revenues 
business processing outsourcing investment in march  the company invested an additional  in a third round private placement of the common stock of premier bpo  inc formerly known as en pointe global services  inc  pbpo 
the company s total investment in pbpo common stock through september  is  and represents an approximate voting interest in such privately held corporation 
pbpo is a business process outsourcing company formed in october and headquartered in clarksville  tennessee 
in addition to the company s pbpo common stock investments described above  the company previously invested an additional  in pbpo in the form of a five year interest bearing note that subsequently was converted into series a non voting convertible preferred stock of pbpo in october the preferred stock may not be converted to common stock until the earlier of five years from the issuance date of the preferred stock or the effective date of an initial public offering 
the conversion price is set as the greater of per share or the fair market value  as determined under the preferred stock agreement 
en pointe s approximate voting interest in pbpo referenced above excludes the series a non voting convertible preferred stock that it holds 
pbpo is considered a related party because of the company s equity interest in pbpo as well as the interrelationship of several of the investors with the company 
one of the company s board members  mark briggs  owns approximately of pbpo and also serves as its chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
further  the company s chairman of the board  bob din  represents en pointe s interest as a member of the board of directors of pbpo 
in addition  the owners of ovex technologies private limited ovex  the pakistani company in islamabad that performs the operational side of the company s outsourcing  owns collectively approximately of pbpo 
the owners of ovex also hold shares of series a non voting convertible preferred stock of pbpo that they received in october in exchange for the conversion of their aggregate  in principal amount of outstanding five year interest bearing notes 

table of contents because of the substantial investment that the company made in pbpo  the related party nature of the investment  as well as other factors  when the company s acquired interest in pbpo was evaluated  it was determined that pbpo met the tests of a variable interest entity under fin and pbpo s financial results have thus been consolidated with the company s financial statements since pbpo s inception 
pbpo has us employees and contracts the services of another workers in pakistan and india to perform back office functions for its customers 
pbpo shares workspace with the company in islamabad for a nominal fee using contracted ovex workers and contracts directly with ovex for workspace and workers in lahore  pakistan 
in september  pbpo entered into a five year cost plus fixed fee service agreement with ovex to supply contracted employees and an operating facility in lahore  pakistan 
in addition  pbpo agreed to provide certain marketing services for ovex 
the agreements can be terminated with thirty days written notice by pbpo 
in september  pbpo also agreed to cancel its option to purchase ovex in consideration for the payment of  by ovex 
the  gain is being amortized over five years  to run concurrent with the five year service agreement entered into with ovex 
in addition  ovex agreed to purchase certain office equipment with a net book value of  for  competition we operate in the highly competitive sales segment of the information technology industry  and compete with a large number and variety of resellers of information technology products and services 
our competition also includes hardware and software manufacturers and national computer retailers that market directly to end users 
many of these companies compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs than us  allowing them to offer the same products and services for less 
others have developed highly specialized practices focusing on specific segments such as security  storage  server consolidation  voice over internet protocol  etc 
many of our competitors are of equal size or smaller and sell to regional markets  or are larger  and sell nationally with substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources available to them 
some of our larger competitors are moredirect  inc  compucom  inc  technology integration group  pomeroy it solutions  inc  cdw corporation  pc mall  inc  zones  inc 
and software spectrum 
a few of these organizations stock inventory and take advantage of opportunistic seasonal buys which often affords them a pricing advantage 
on the services side  we compete with several large service providers  some of whom provide products and services and others who only provide services 
those that provide services only include banctec  inc  barrister global services network 
and halifax corporation 
we also partner with service only providers in several areas including dispatch  install  move  add and change support services 
dell and gateway  inc gateway initially launched the manufacturer direct model and were successful in gaining market share 
other manufacturers eg ibm and hp have adopted a direct model to actively market products directly to customers 
sometimes this is done through an agent referral program by which independent sales agents receive commissions directly from manufacturers 
this has had the effect of reducing the role of distributors and resellers  particularly in the enterprise accounts  which is a large percentage of our traditional target market 
in order to compensate for this potential loss of business  some distributors are now also adopting sales agent programs as an alternative means of directly securing product orders to end user customers 
the direct business model can infringe on some value added resellers  such as us  by taking a slice of those sales that can be resolved through a single vendor solution 
our business model emphasizes comprehensive solution offerings with services wrapped around hardware and software products  attracting mainly enterprise organizations  government and to a lesser extent  mid market customers 
with the sales channel continuing to consolidate  absorbing those companies that combine face to face direct selling with web based models  we believe that our business model will succeed  as it embraces both comprehensive and web based types of selling methods  allowing us to cater to various customer preferences 
we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our ebusiness systems  services flexibility  and the scalability of our operations to meet our customers needs as well as providing a single point of contact for hardware  software  and services 

table of contents getting product to the customer the distribution of information technology products requires considerable investment in inventory  production control systems  and the development and maintenance of distribution channels 
resellers who assume these functions incur capital costs associated with the warehousing of products  including the costs of leasing warehouse space  maintaining inventory and tracking systems  and employing personnel to perform all the associated tasks 
furthermore  resellers who stock inventory risk obsolescence costs  which we believe may be significant due to the rapid product innovation that characterizes this market 
these overhead and touch costs require expenses that we believe more than offset the lower price advantages offered for purchasing at volume discounts and holding for future sale 
our business model eliminates many overhead and touch costs and substantial risks by leveraging the operational strengths of our suppliers  who have developed extensive warehousing  purchasing and distribution functions 
as a result  our continuing strategy is to limit our product inventory and the associated capital costs  allowing us to accept lower gross profit margins than many of our competitors 
by relying on the processing strengths of our suppliers  we are able to concentrate on developing our information systems and focus on more customer oriented activities including researching  specifying  and delivering solutions 
after helping a customer select the most appropriate technology  our sales staff use our information systems to determine the best combination of price and availability for a wide variety of information technology products 
our ability to fill and deliver orders with a high level of speed and accuracy is a key benefit of our business model 
our sophisticated systems  which include all order processing functions  enable us to review  approve  and electronically transmit orders to the proper supplier s within minutes of receiving them from customers 
most orders for in stock product are picked  staged  and drop shipped directly to the customer from the suppliers within hours of receipt of an order  and on the same business day for orders received by pm pacific time 
we usually electronically obtain order delivery information the day following shipment from our major suppliers 
we then use that information to produce an invoice  which is often sent to the customer electronically 
the standard delivery  based on product availability  is within two to three business days 
custom configuration usually adds a few more business days to the shipping time 
getting product from the supplier our staff has the ability to access the current inventory and availability records of our suppliers  so we can quickly determine which supplier can best fill an order at a given price 
furthermore  if any one supplier is unable to fill all of a customer s requirements  we are generally able to split the order among multiple sources 
this increases the same day fill rate  reduces back orders  and shrinks the time to complete an order 
our suppliers maintain warehouses throughout the country  and their individual stocking levels are updated and readily available through our systems 
this allows our staff to determine where the product is available for shipment  better gauging the delivery time to the customer s door 
we and our suppliers utilize various carriers  including industry giants united parcel service  inc and federal express corporation  to deliver product 
again taking advantage of a vendor s particular expertise  we integrate the carriers tracking system facility into our own systems to closely monitor shipments and provide delivery status for our customers 
this provides an audit trail for the customer to update order status  by tying the customer purchase order to an en pointe invoice and a subsequent proof of delivery 
we purchase most of our products from major distributors such as synnex corporation synnex  tech data corporation tech data  and ingram micro inc ingram micro  and directly from large manufacturers such as ibm  hp including the former compaq  dell and microsoft 
these are suppliers who have the requisite system strengths and integration capabilities that enable our automated systems to function efficiently 
we have successfully implemented our business strategy due in large part to these system synergies and to our close relationships with our suppliers 
equally significant to the success of our supplier relationships has been the volume of business we generate  as this volume has allowed us to negotiate more favorable terms with our suppliers 
see business factors which may affect future operating results we risk depending on a few distributors and manufacturers who could compete with us or limit our access to their product line 
table of contents intellectual property our ability to effectively compete in our market will depend significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have patents on any of our technology  which we believe to be material to our future success 
we rely primarily on trade secrets  proprietary knowledge and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our rights in intellectual property  and to maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar or superior intellectual property  gain access to our trade secrets or knowledge  or that any confidentiality agreements between us and our employees will provide meaningful protection for us in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information 
supplyaccess  inc supplyaccess  a former affiliate of ours  liquidated in february  and as a result of that liquidation  we acquired the full rights to accesspointe tm as well as the intellectual property rights to all of supplyaccess s software  copyrights  trade secrets and other proprietary technology 
we conduct our business under the trademark and service mark en pointe technologies as well as our logo  accesspointe tm and other marks 
we have been issued registrations for our en pointe technologies and building blocks marks in the united states and have pending registrations in canada  mexico and the european community 
we do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks 
we also sell products and provide services under various trademarks  service marks  and trade names that are the properties of others 
these owners have reserved all rights with respect to their respective trademarks  service marks  and trade names 
segment information the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  require public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments 
we identify reportable segments based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information  business activities and management responsibility 
for the years ended september   and  we operated in only one segment 
employees as of september   we employed approximately individuals including approximately sales  marketing and related support personnel  service and support personnel  warehousing  manufacturing  and logistic personnel  information technology personnel and employees in administration and finance 
in addition  pbpo  a consolidated affiliate of ours  employed individuals  in sales and marketing  in operations  and in administration 
we believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical and other management personnel will be critical to our ability to execute our business model and growth strategy 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
in addition to our us employees  we have contracted with two companies in islamabad  pakistan to provide back office support 
as of september   these two firms employed approximately people dedicated to supporting en pointe 
approximately people provided accounting and administrative support while the remaining provided customer support  telemarketing  purchasing  operations  help desk and information technology functions 
these individuals under contract are employees of kpmg taseer hadi co  a pakistani member firm of kpmg  and ovex 
our affiliate  pbpo  has contracted with ovex in pakistan and colwell and salmon in india to provide a workforce of approximately workers for back office support 
pbpo shares workspace with the company in islamabad for a nominal fee using contracted ovex workers and contracts directly with ovex for workspace and workers in lahore 
factors which may affect future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in light of the important factors that can materially affect results  including but not limited to those set forth in 
table of contents this paragraph and below  the inclusion of forward looking information herein should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved  we may encounter competitive  technological  financial  economic and business challenges making it more difficult than expected to continue to sell our products and services  we may be unable to retain existing key sales  technical and management personnel  there may be other material adverse changes in the information technology industry or the economy  or in our operations or business  and any or all of these factors may affect our ability to continue our current sales rate or may result in lower sales volume than currently experienced 
certain important factors affecting the forward looking statements made herein include  but are not limited to declining sales in three of the last six years  limited availability of alternative credit facilities  low margin business  concentration of product and service sales in several major customers  and future funding required to sustain our investment in pbpo and the absorption of related losses until pbpo becomes profitable  if at all 
assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments  the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing  capital expenditure or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the reader is therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained herein  which speak as of the date of this annual report on form k 
the reader should carefully consider the following risks 
in addition  keep in mind that the risks described below are not the only risks faced 
the risks described below are only the risks that we currently believe are material to our business 
however  additional risks not presently known  or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial  may also impair business operations 
there are risks in conducting our daily business plans and strategy for our first six years since inception  we experienced rapid growth in net sales  employees and branch offices 
beginning in fiscal year  and continuing two consecutive years until fiscal year  we experienced net sales declines of approximately over the three fiscal years 
the effort to reverse the past contraction of net sales or to supplement the loss of sales with higher margin products or services has and will continue to challenge our management  operational and financial resources 
to execute our recovery strategy  we expect to require the addition of new management personnel  including sales and technical services personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel 
our ability to manage our recovery effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and sales systems at both the national and local level  to develop the skills of our managers and supervisors and to hire  train  motivate  retain and effectively manage our employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such recovery  and the failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there are risks outside of our control of unfavorable economic conditions that could negatively impact on our revenues and profits revenue growth depends on the overall demand for information technology spending 
while economic recovery in the united states appears to be underway  there can be no assurance that the recovery will continue or that it will be sufficiently robust to compensate for the past severe contraction 
any resumption in the downturn in the united states economy may result in cutbacks by customers in the purchase of information technology products and services  postponed or canceled orders  longer sales cycles and lower average selling prices 
to the extent that a downturn resumes or increases in severity  we believe demand for our products and services  and therefore future revenues  could be further adversely impacted 

table of contents there is a risk we could lose our asset based financing line without being able to readily replace it our business requires significant capital to finance accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  product inventories 
in order to obtain necessary working capital  we rely primarily on a line of credit that is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as a result  the amount of credit available to us may be adversely affected by numerous factors beyond our control  such as delays in collection or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable  economic trends in the information technology industry  interest rate fluctuations and the lending policies of our creditors 
any decrease or material limitation on the amount of capital available to us under our line of credit and other financing arrangements  particularly our interest free flooring  may limit our ability to fill existing sales orders or expand our sales levels and  therefore  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  any significant increases in interest rates may increase the cost of financing for us and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are dependent on the availability of accounts receivable financing on reasonable terms and at levels that are high relative to our equity base in order to maintain and increase our sales 
there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to us in the future or available under terms acceptable to us 
our inability to have continuous access to such financing at reasonable costs could materially adversely impact our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as of september   we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of million out of a total credit facility of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our low margins expose us to risks from minor adversities our overall gross profit percentages for the past three fiscal years ended september  were   and  respectively  with gross margin from product sales in such fiscal years being  and  respectively 
our gross profit margins on product and software sales are low compared to many other resellers of information technology products and have continued to shrink 
given the significant levels of competition that characterize the reseller market  as well as the lower gross profit margins that we generate as a result of our reliance on purchasing information technology products from our suppliers  it is unlikely that we will be able to increase product gross profit margins appreciably in our core business of reselling information technology products 
moreover  in order to attract and retain many of our larger customers  we frequently must agree to pricing and maximum allowable mark ups that serve to limit the profitability of product sales to such customers 
accordingly  to the extent that our sales to such customers increase  our gross profit margins may be reduced  and therefore any future increases in net income will have to be derived from net sales growth  effective expansion into higher margin business segments or a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  none of which can be assured 
furthermore  low gross profit margins increase the sensitivity of our business to increases in costs of financing  because financing costs to carry a receivable can be relatively high compared to the low dollar amount of gross profit on the sale underlying the receivable itself 
low gross profit margins also increase the sensitivity of the business to any increase in product returns and bad debt write offs  as the impact resulting from the inability to collect the full amount for products sold will be relatively high compared to the low amount of gross profit on the sale of such product 
any failure by us to maintain our gross profit margins and sales levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there is risk that a large customer could be lost without being able to find a ready replacement for the year ended september   no one customer accounted for or more of our total net sales 
however  our sales do tend to be concentrated in a relatively few accounts with our top five customers accounting for an aggregate of of total net sales and our top twenty five customers representing an aggregate of of total net sales 
in fiscal  one customer  los angeles county  accounted for more than of total net sales 
for the year ended september   our service sales were also highly concentrated with seven large customers accounting for an aggregate of of total service sales while in the prior fiscal year six large customers accounted for an aggregate of of total service sales 
our contracts for the provision of products or services are generally non exclusive agreements that are terminable 
table of contents by either party upon days notice 
either the loss of any large customer  or the failure of any large customer to pay its accounts receivable on a timely basis  or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
with our fast changing industry evolution we risk being outmoded or excluded from the distribution channel the personal computer industry is undergoing significant change 
in addition  a number of alternative  cost effective channels of distribution have developed in the industry  such as the internet  computer superstores  consumer electronic and office supply superstores  national direct marketers and mass merchants 
computer resellers are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other resellers and or direct marketers to achieve economies of scale and increased efficiency 
the current industry reconfiguration and the trend towards consolidation could cause the industry to become even more competitive  further increase pricing pressures and make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins or to increase or maintain the same level of net sales or gross profit 
declining prices  resulting in part from technological changes  may require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit 
such a trend could make it more difficult for us to continue to increase our net sales and earnings growth 
in addition  growth in the personal computer market has slowed 
if the growth rate of the personal computer market were to further decrease  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
the segment of the information technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with a large number and wide variety of resellers and providers of information technology products and services  including traditional personal computer retailers  computer superstores  consumer electronics and office supply superstores  mass merchandisers  corporate resellers  value added resellers  specialty retailers  distributors  franchisers  mail order and web order companies  national computer retailers  service only providers  and manufacturers that have their own direct marketing operations to end users 
many of these companies compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs than us  which allow them to offer the same products and services at lower prices 
many of our competitors are larger  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and offer a broader range of value added services than we do 
we compete with  among others  compucom systems  inc  dell  gateway  pomeroy computer resources  inc  cdw computer centers  inc  ibm  hp compaq  insight enterprises  inc  pc mall  inc  gtsi corp  zones  inc  pc connection  inc  and certain distributors 
we expect to face additional competition from new market entrants in the future 
competitive factors include price  service and support  the variety of products and value added services offered  and marketing and sales capabilities 
while we believe that we compete successfully with respect to most  if not all of these factors  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
the information technology industry has come to be characterized by aggressive price cutting and we expect 
table of contents pricing pressures will continue in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology and associated inventory and product obsolescence  rapid changes in consumer preferences  short product life cycles and evolving industry standards 
we will need to continue to provide competitive prices  superior product selection and quick delivery response time in addition to developing a core competency in performing value added services in order to remain competitive 
if we were to fail to compete favorably with respect to any of these factors  our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 
see business competition 
we risk depending on a few distributors and manufacturers who could compete with us or limit our access to their product line a key element of our past success and future business strategy involves the maintaining of alliances with certain key suppliers of information technology products and services  including  tech data  dell  synnex  ingram micro and microsoft 
these alliances enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without subjecting us to many of the costs and risks associated with maintaining large amounts of inventory 
products and services purchased from those five suppliers accounted for of our aggregate purchases in fiscal certain suppliers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of allowances passed through from manufacturers  discounts  credits and cooperative advertising  which incentives directly affect our operating income 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives in the future and any reduction in the amount of these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  we compete with certain suppliers for many of the same customers 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any such allied distributor will not use its position as a key supplier to pressure us from directly competing with them 
substantially all of our contracts with our suppliers are terminable by either party upon days notice or less and several contain minimum purchase volume requirements as a condition to providing discounts to us 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of the suppliers  modification of the terms or discontinuance of agreements with any of the suppliers  failure to meet minimum purchase volume requirements  or the failure to maintain a good working relationship with any significant new distributor of information technology products could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business getting product to the customer 
certain of the products we offer are subject to manufacturer allocations  which limit the number of units of such products available to the suppliers  which in turn may limit the number of units available to us for resale to our customers 
because of these limitations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offer popular new products or product enhancements to our customers in sufficient quantity or in a timely manner to meet demand 
in order to offer the products of most manufacturers  we are required to obtain authorizations from such manufacturers to act as a reseller of such products  which authorizations may be terminated at the discretion of the suppliers 
as well  certain manufacturers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of allowances  training  financing  rebates  discounts  credits and cooperative advertising  which incentives directly affect our operating income 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives and authorizations in the future and any reduction in these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain authorizations to offer products  directly or indirectly  from new or existing manufacturers 
termination of our rights to act as a reseller of the products of one or more significant manufacturers or our failure to gain sufficient access to such new products or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
evolution of the distribution process in the information technology industry has put pressure on gross profit margins  and has adversely affected a number of distributors of information technology products  including certain suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the continuing evolution of the information technology industry will not further adversely affect our distributors 
because our overall business strategy depends on our relationships with our suppliers  our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected in the event that distributors in general and suppliers in particular continue to suffer adverse consequences due to ongoing changes in the information technology industry 
there has been a consolidation trend in the information technology industry  including consolidation among 
table of contents distributors of information technology products 
because our business model is dependent upon the availability of a number of information technology product distributors  any further consolidation would result in fewer distributors available to supply products to us  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk losing communications with our back office operation in pakistan in fiscal  we began a business transformation that relocated many of our back office functions to service providers in islamabad  pakistan 
these back office functions include  among others  customer support  purchasing  credit and collections  accounts payable  accounting and other administrative and support functions 
we established both voice and data communications between our corporate headquarters in el segundo  california and pakistan 
however  there can be no assurance that these lines of communication will not be interrupted 
should we have interruptions with pakistan  any such interruption could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we have the risk of losing our senior management and other key personnel upon whom we depend we believe that our success has been and will continue to be dependent on the services and efforts of our existing senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of any of our existing senior management and other key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our success and plans for future growth also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including application development  sales and technical services 
competition for qualified personnel in the information technology industry is intense  and although we believe that we have thus far been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel for our business  the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk failure to integrate acquisitions and or investments into our business that could cause future losses one element of our growth strategy may include expanding our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses 
in march  the company invested an additional  in a third round of private placements of the common stock of pbpo 
the company s total investment in pbpo common stock through june  was  and represents an approximate voting interest in the privately held corporation 
in addition  we previously provided pbpo with a  five year interest bearing note for working capital that we converted into series a non voting preferred stock in october because pbpo is considered a variable interest entity under fin  we are required to consolidate our interest in pbpo 
there can be no assurance that we will be able provide any future funding required to sustain our investment in pbpo and that we will be able to absorb any related losses until pbpo becomes profitable  if at all 
we have not had significant acquisition or investment experience  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates  complete acquisitions or investments  or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including but not limited to failure to achieve anticipated operating results  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products  vendor agreements  and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention and other resources from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees  customers  or contracts of the acquired company 

table of contents acquisition and investments could also conflict with restrictions in our agreements with existing or future lenders  distributors or manufacturers 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition or investment candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition or investment will be completed or successfully integrated 
failure to successfully manage potential acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  or pbpo s failure to make profitable business decisions while it is characterized as a variable interest entity  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk business interruption from our dependence on centralized operations we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our customers 
as a result  a substantial disruption of our day to day operations could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  our success is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our information systems  which are primarily based in el segundo and ontario  california 
repairs  replacement  relocation or a substantial interruption in these systems or in our telephone or data communications systems  servers or power could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
although we have business interruption insurance  an uninsurable loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our current use of a single configuration facility in ontario  california also makes us more vulnerable to dramatic changes in freight rates than a competitor with multiple  geographically dispersed sites 
losses in excess of insurance coverage  an uninsurable loss  or change in freight rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
with the concentration of ownership of our stock held by a small group of directors  officers  family members and an outside principal stockholder there are risks they can exert significance influence over corporate matters the directors  executive officers  family members and an outside principal stockholders of en pointe and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders acting together will be able to exert considerable influence over the election of our directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
additionally  the directors and executive officers have significant influence over the policies and operations of our management and the conduct of our business 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of en pointe and consequently could affect the market price of our common stock 
there are risks quarterly operating results can vary from past results and become volatile and unpredictable our quarterly net sales and operating results may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the demand for information technology products and value added services  adoption of internet commerce models  introduction of new hardware and software technologies  introduction of new value added services by us and our competitors  changes in manufacturers prices or price protection policies  changes in shipping rates  disruption of warehousing or shipping channels  changes in the level of operating expenses  including costs from turnover of sales personnel  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  inventory adjustments  
table of contents changes in product mix  entry into new geographic markets  the timing and integration of acquisitions or investments  difficulty in managing margins  the loss of significant customer contracts  the necessity to write off a significant amount of accounts receivable or inventory  and general competitive and economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in such quarter 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as has occurred in the past it is possible that in future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our stock tends to be volatile with large percentage price moves which can expose investors to unanticipated losses factors such as the announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  governmental regulatory action  general trends and market conditions in the information technology industry  as well as other factors  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
moreover  trading volumes in our common stock has been low historically and could exacerbate price fluctuations in the common stock 
further  the stock market has recently and in other periods experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock

if our internal controls prove to be infective that could negatively impact investors and cause our stock price to drop changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the nasdaq exchange  or nasd  are creating uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
we are undergoing an evaluation of our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls 
we are also in the process of performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result  we expect to incur substantial additional expenses and diversion of management s time 
while we anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section by the extended september  deadline  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations since there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasd 
any such action could harm our business or investors confidence in our company  and could cause our stock price to fall 
if preferred stock is ever issued as an anti takeover measure  there is a risk that common stockholders could be adversely affected our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  qualifications  limitations and restrictions  including voting rights  of 
table of contents those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  section of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of en pointe without action by our stockholders  and therefore could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

executive overview we initially began our operations in march of as a reseller of information technology products 
in fiscal  we began offering value added services to our customers 
gradually value added services represented a larger percentage of total net sales  accounting for and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the gross profit margins on the value added services that we currently offer are significantly higher than the gross profit margins on our information technology product business  but require additional overhead expense for supervision  idle time  and other expenses related to service offerings that offset a portion of the increased margin 
in our initial operating years from fiscal to fiscal  with the aid of a robust economy and information technology market that accommodated our business model  our net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 
seasonal trends were never prominent in our business  although march quarters were historically regarded as one of the least promising quarters 
in fiscal we experienced our first annual net sales decline of  or million  from net sales in fiscal due to a softer information technology market and difficulties in transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning business system 
a declining trend resumed in fiscal years and with declines of and  respectively 
the trend was temporarily reversed in fiscal when net sales increased from that of the prior year  but fiscal year disappointed  with net sales marginally lower by from fiscal year however  fiscal brought a rebound in net sales with a increase over the fiscal year results that built on the initial turnaround in fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal came at a cost with a noticeable decline in gross profits from the service side of the business that limited the growth in gross profits to 
with an increase in operating expenses  chiefly selling and marketing  of million inclusive of million attributable to our affiliate  pbpo  we suffered an  operating loss for the year 
the operating loss was reversed by the presence of a greater sum of non operating income  including other income and the allocation of the pbpo loss to outside stockholders that allowed us to realize a marginal net profit for the year 
because our business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  we do not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
we typically do not place an order for product purchases from distributors until it has received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or shipped to our configuration center in ontario  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of our product net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although we maintain a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  we record as inventory any merchandise being configured and any products purchased from distributors and shipped  but not yet received and accepted by our customers 

table of contents product revenues are generally recognized upon delivery to the customer 
service revenues are recognized based on contractual hourly rates as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contract services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts 
cost of sales includes product and service costs and current and estimated allowances for returns of products that are not accepted by our distributors or manufacturers  less any incentive credits 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
we apply the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
in general  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
under our shipping terms  title and risk of loss to merchandise shipped does not pass to customers until delivered takes place which is generally two to three days 
product is therefore considered received and accepted by the customer only upon the customer s receipt of the product from the carrier 
any undelivered product is included in our inventory 
the majority of our sales relate to physical products and are recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as net sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales 
a very small portion of hardware and software products or services  that we offer for which we are not the primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  such revenues are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period  based on the nature of the contract  at the net amount retained by us  with no cost of sales 
service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates  as services are rendered  or upon completion of specified contracted services and acceptance by the customer 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts and estimated allowances for sales returns 
cost of sales include the cost of product and services sold and current and estimated allowances for product returns that will not be accepted by our suppliers  less rebates 
deferred revenues result from prepaid management services and maintenance contracts 
many of our management services are pre billed quarterly and income is recognized as services are performed 
our maintenance contracts are generally for services that may be performed over a one year period of time 
income is recognized on such contracts ratably over the period of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables by two methods 
first  we evaluate specific accounts over days outstanding and apply various levels of risk analysis to these accounts to determine a satisfactory risk category to which given percentages are 
table of contents applied to establish a reserve 
second  a general reserve is established for all other accounts  exclusive of the accounts identified for the specific reserve  in which a percentage is applied that is supportable by historic collection patterns 
product returns 
we provide an allowance for sales returns  which is based on historical experience 
in general  we follow a strict policy of duplicating the terms of our vendor or manufacturers product return policies 
however  in certain cases we must deviate from this policy in order to satisfy the requirements of certain sales contracts and or to satisfy or maintain customer relations 
to establish a reserve for returns  outstanding return merchandise authorizations rma are reviewed 
those rmas issued for which the related product has not been returned by the customer are considered future sale reversals and are fully reserved 
in addition  an estimate  based on historical return patterns  is provided for probable future rmas that relate to past sales 
generally  customers return goods to our configuration facility in ontario  california  where they are processed to return to the vendor 
vendor returns 
after product has been returned to vendors under authenticated rmas  we review such outstanding receivables from our vendors and establish a reserve on product that will not qualify for refund based on a review of specific vendor receivables 
rebates and cooperative marketing incentives 
we receive incentives from suppliers related to product and volume rebates and cooperative marketing development funds 
these incentives are generally under monthly  quarterly  or annual agreements with the suppliers  however  some of these incentives are product driven or are provided to support specific programs established by the supplier 
suppliers generally require that we use their cooperative marketing development funds exclusively for advertising or other marketing programs 
as marketing expenses are recognized  these restricted cooperative marketing development funds are recorded as a reduction of the related marketing expense with any excess funding that can not be identified with a specific vendor program reducing gross profits 
as rebates are earned  we record the rebate receivables with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold 
any amounts received from suppliers related to cooperative marketing development funds  are deferred until earned 
incentive programs are subject to audit as to whether the requirements of the incentives were actually met 
we establish reserves to cover any collectibility risks including subsequent supplier audits 
inventory 
although we employ a virtual inventory model that generally limits our exposure to inventory losses  with certain large customers we contractually obligate ourselves to product availability terms that require maintaining physical inventory  as well as configured product 
such inventory is generally confined to a very limited range of product that applies to specific customers or contracts 
included in our inventory is product that has been returned by customers but is not acceptable as returnable by the vendor 
as a result  we expose ourselves to losses from such inventory that requires reserves for losses to be established 
we record varying reserves based upon the class of inventory ie held for resale or returned from customers and age of inventory

on a quarterly basis with fiscal year and respective quarters  net sales improved each quarter with the september quarter registering the largest increase   over the comparable fiscal quarter 
in both fiscal years  however  the june quarter recorded the largest amount of net sales due to a large flux of governmental orders with the preceding quarter  march  having the least net sales during the respective fiscal years 
no one customer accounted for or more of total net sales in fiscal as compared to a single customer accounting for of our net sales in the year ended september  however  our sales do tend to be concentrated in a relatively few accounts as evidenced in fiscal year when our top five customers made up of total net sales and our top twenty five customers contributed of total net sales 
product sales in fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year service revenues also increased year over year but at a more modest rate with revenues increasing million  or  from that reported in the prior fiscal year 
service revenues  on a quarterly sequential basis  were strongest in our september quarter  rising to million for the quarter  a high for the fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profits increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million for fiscal year all of the million increase in gross profits can be attributed to increased product sales  not to an improvement in gross margins  as the percentage margins we realized on product sales held steady at of net sales in both fiscal years 
product gross profits increased million  while service gross profits  on the other hand  decreased million  or  in fiscal year to million from 
table of contents million in fiscal year expressed as a percentage of net sales  service percentage margins declined to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decline in the service percentage margins was responsible for the decline in combined margins to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decline in service gross margin to for fiscal year results first from comparisons with fiscal year periods that contained unusually robust profit margins during which gross margins were decelerating from in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year to in the fourth quarter 
the record gross margin in the first two quarters of fiscal year was the result of unusually high short term project revenue on contracts that were concluding 
secondly  the service business that was concluded was replaced by shorter term jobs producing lower margins  some under targeted ranges  in order to capture new business 
we believe that future service gross margins will be substantially less than the to of the past  and will average in the to range 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year the million increase is inclusive of an increase in pbpo s selling and marketing expenses of million 
excluding pbpo s portion of the consolidated selling and marketing expense increase  our core selling and marketing expenses increased by million 
the increases in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal year resulted primarily from million expended to increase our sales force to support and provide for our sales growth  another million related to increased work force benefits  and an additional million related to improving our outsourced back office capabilities 
reduction of selling and marketing expenses was achieved  in part  by a million reduction of our connectivity expenses 
because of the increase in sales volume in fiscal year  when selling and marketing expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  there results a favorable decline of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses g a increased marginally by million  or  to million in fiscal year from in fiscal year the million of g a expenses recorded in fiscal year includes million of expense from our affiliate  pbpo  an increase of million from the corresponding pbpo expense that we recognized in fiscal year exclusive of pbpo s million increase in g a expenses  our core business g a expenses fell million 
major components of the million reduction include a reduction in salaries  bonuses and other compensation of million 
offsetting the wage reduction  in part  was an increase of million related to improving our outsourced back office capabilities 
when g a expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  there results a decrease of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year operating loss income 
an operating loss of million was realized in fiscal year compared with million of operating income in the prior fiscal year 
the decline of million in operating income can be attributed to the disproportionally large increase in selling and marketing expenses of million during fiscal year discussed above that exceeded the million increase in gross profits during such period 
the operating loss expressed as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared with an operating income percentage of in fiscal year interest income expense  net 
interest income of  in fiscal year is net of interest income of  and interest expense of  interest expense in fiscal year was  the decrease in interest expense in fiscal year resulted principally from increased interest free borrowings under the lending facility from ge commercial distribution finance corporation that was established in june as well as the change in lending terms that allows us to earn interest on customer payments until the semi monthly financing payments are due 
the remainder of the decline resulted from the change in accounting treatment in the second quarter of fiscal year when the ontario facility was changed from a capitalized lease in which interest was previously recorded to an operating lease in which rental expense is now recorded 

table of contents other income 
other income remained relatively constant at million in fiscal years and other income consisted chiefly of insurance recovery from prior year losses  rental income  and early payment discounts from state sales tax authorities 
provision for income taxes 
we provided a  tax provision for fiscal year   less than was provided in the prior fiscal year which is due  in part  to our reduced earnings 
while we are not subject to the regular corporate federal income tax rates because of the tax benefit derived from our past net operating losses  or nols  that can be carried forward  we are nevertheless subject to the federal alternative minimum tax 
the alternative minimum tax limits nol carryforwards that can be applied in any one year to of the current year s taxable income and imposes a tax on the remaining of taxable income 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of our state tax returns we file separately under the name of our wholly owned sales subsidiary  en pointe technologies sales  inc  that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
our consolidated return excludes pbpo because our investment is less than the required to consolidate under federal tax law 
thus  none of the losses generated by pbpo are available for the reduction of income taxes 
as of september   we had million of nol carry forwards for which a valuation allowance has been provided 
the nol carry forwards are scheduled to expire at various dates through fiscal year section of the internal revenue code could limit the future use of some or all of the nol carry forwards if the ownership of our common stock changes by more than percentage points in certain circumstances over a three year testing period 
of the total million nol carry forwards  million will be considered an adjustment to additional paid in capital and will not benefit future earnings  since those losses were attributable to the exercise of employee stock options  which had been recognized as expense for tax purposes but not for financial statement purposes 
minority interest 
under fin and other recent changes in consolidation principles  certain minority interests are required to be consolidated 
we own approximately of pbpo and under fin are required to consolidate pbpo s financial results in our financial statements 
as a result  we allocate certain losses to the other stockholders of pbpo who collectively own approximately of pbpo 
losses so allocated to the minority interest are not based upon the percentage of ownership  but upon the at risk capital of those owners 
once the minority interest at risk capital has been absorbed by losses  all remaining losses are allocated to us  without regard for the amount of capital that we hold at risk 
net income loss 
net income decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the principal reason for the million decline in net income was our million decline in operating income that was offset  in part  by million of non operating income  principally other income and income from recognizing the minority interest in our affiliate s loss 
as a percentage of net sales  net income was in fiscal year  as compared with in fiscal year comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net sales was product related  as we maintained margins by shifting our emphasis from lower margin product sales to higher margin service sales 
a decline in net sales prevailed in each quarter of fiscal  except for the june quarter that benefited from a large increase in governmental sales 
for the year ended september   one customer accounted for of our net sales and of our accounts receivable 
product sales in fiscal declined million  or from fiscal service sales  on the other hand  increased million  or from that of the prior fiscal year 
growth in service sales lagged the fiscal year increase of million  or  over the fiscal year results  attributed  in part  to several projects that favorably impacted the second half of fiscal that wound down in early fiscal and the loss of a major service customer at the end of the june quarter 
gross profit 
gross profits decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million for fiscal year all of the million decrease in gross profits can be attributed to 
table of contents decreased product sales as well as decreased product margins 
product gross profit percentage of sales margins slipped from in fiscal year to in fiscal year expressed as a percentage of net sales  the service gross profit percentage in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year to  which is more in line with our anticipated to range for services 
even with the decline in service margins  service gross profits managed an increased of million  or  due to the additional volume provided by the million service revenue increase in fiscal strength in services allowed gross margins for both product and service to remain relatively constant in fiscal years and at and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the million decrease is inclusive of pbpo s initial fiscal year selling and marketing expenses of million 
excluding pbpo s portion of the combined selling and marketing expense  our core selling and marketing expenses decreased to million  or  as compared to the fiscal results 
most of the decrease in selling and marketing expense can be traced to a reduction of employee related expense of million 
to accomplish the employee related expense decrease of million  in part  we incurred million in expense for our program to outsource our back office sales support offshore  which  in effect  contributed to the million net expense reduction benefit 
we also had a favorable million reduction in connectivity and rent related expenses 
expressed as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expense decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at million in fiscal and the current year s million of general and administrative expenses includes million of expense from our affiliate  pbpo  whose operations were not present in fiscal the major increases to general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included an increase in employee related expenses of million 
this was due to increased information technology wages  executive bonuses  and employee benefits of million  less reduced accounting and finance wages of million 
our reduction in accounting and finance wages resulted principally from our efforts to outsource offshore  in which we incurred an additional million of outsourcing expense  that resulted in a savings of million 
in addition  there were million in reduced attorney fees and million in reduced software maintenance and support expenses related to our sap license 
when general and administrative expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  there was a small increase of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year operating loss income 
operating income improved million  from a million loss in fiscal year to million income in fiscal year the improvement can be attributed to the reduction in selling and marketing expenses of million discussed above that more than made up for the million decline in gross profits 
operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales  improved to in fiscal year from a negative in fiscal year interest income expense  net 
interest expense of million is net of interest income of million 
interest expense decreased million from million in fiscal year most of the interest expense  million  incurred by us represents interest expense related to our ontario facility that is being treated as a financing lease and is presently carried as a long term liability 
interest expense incurred under our previous lender  whose financing arrangement was replaced by ge in june  amounted to million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we provided a million tax provision for fiscal year approximately of that provision was for state income tax for california  where we are domiciled and where net operating losses nol have temporarily been suspended 
the remainder of the million provision is for federal income tax 
we had a million nol carry forward from which million has been applied to our current year s federal taxable income  leaving an million nol carry forward available for future periods 
while we are not subject to the regular corporate federal income tax rates because our nol carry forwards exceed our taxable income  we are nevertheless subject to the alternative minimum tax 
table of contents amt that bears a rate and limits nol carry forwards to  thereby mandating that at least of our taxable income becomes subject to the amt tax 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of our state tax returns we file separately under the name of our wholly owned sales subsidiary en pointe technologies sales  inc that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
our consolidated return excludes pbpo because our investment is less than the required to consolidate under federal tax law 
thus  none of the losses generated by pbpo are available for the reduction of income taxes 
as of september   we had million of nol carry forwards for which a valuation allowance has been provided 
the nol carry forwards are scheduled to expire at various dates through fiscal year section of the internal revenue code could limit the future use of some or all of the nol carry forwards if the ownership of our common stock changes by more than percentage points in certain circumstances over a three year testing period 
of the total million nol carry forwards  million will be considered an adjustment to additional paid in capital and will not benefit future earnings  since those losses were attributable to the exercise of employee stock options  which had been recognized as expense for tax purposes but not for financial statement purposes 
minority interest 
under fin and other recent changes in consolidation principles  certain minority interests are required to be consolidated 
we own an approximate voting interest in the commons shares of pbpo and under fin are required to consolidate pbpo s financial results in our financial statements 
as a result  we allocate certain losses to the other shareholders of pbpo who collectively own approximately of pbpo 
losses so allocated to the minority interest are not based upon the percentage of ownership  but upon the at risk capital of those owners 
once the minority interest at risk capital has been absorbed by losses  all remaining losses are allocated to us  without regard for the amount of capital that we hold at risk 
income from reversal of losses from affiliates 
as result of the deconsolidation of two previously consolidated subsidiaries  in the june quarter of we began using the equity method of accounting to record our interest in the losses related to the two affiliates 
because we had guaranteed certain debts of our affiliates and were responsible under certain other obligations  losses in excess of our investment in our affiliates were recorded 
the majority of the income from the reversal of losses was reversed in prior years with the remaining balance of million reversed in the first quarter of fiscal year net income loss 
net income increased million to million from a net loss of million in prior fiscal year the principal reason for our improvement in the net income was due to the reduction in selling and marketing expenses of million discussed above 
as a percentage of net sales  net income was in fiscal  as compared with net loss in fiscal 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  our operating activities used cash totaling million  million more than the million provided in the prior fiscal year 
the lead contributor to the million net decrease in cash from operating activities was a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory  as these working asset accounts built up partially in response to the million increase in net sales 
our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts  at september  and  was million and million  respectively 
the million increase in accounts receivable reflects  in part  the increase in net sales for the fiscal year as well as certain governmental net sales that were past late 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased to days from days  as of september  and  respectively 
inventory increased million in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year 
most of the increase  million  was for product purchased for configuration for specific customers orders 
the remainder was for inventory that was shipped to customers and in transit 
trade accounts payable increased million  while net borrowings under our credit line used primarily for the purchase of product decreased million 
the net increase of million in trade accounts payable 
table of contents and borrowings under our line of credit reflects  in part  our build up of inventory for customer configuration as well as other increased trade related expenses 
investing activities used cash totaling million for fiscal  an increase of million from the prior fiscal year 
while we purchased million more in equipment  chiefly computer related equipment  in fiscal year over fiscal  in fiscal year we also expended million more than fiscal for the acquisition of viablelinks  inc financing activities used net cash totaling million in fiscal  or million more than the million of net cash that was provided in fiscal most of the million increase in cash used in fiscal was from net repayments of our borrowings under our line of credit in contrast to our net borrowings in the prior fiscal year 
as of september   we had approximately million in cash and working capital of million 
to improve our financing flexibility and reduce costs  in june we closed a million replacement working capital financing facility with ge commercial distribution finance corporation ge 
in august  we obtained a temporary overline through october  of  bringing the total borrowing capacity to million 
the term of the facility is for a period of three years  except that either party may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice to the other party 
additionally  ge may terminate the facility at any time upon the occurrence of  and subsequent failure to cure in certain instances  an event of default as such term in defined in such agreement 
under the financing facility  we may borrow up to of the eligible accounts receivable at an interest rate of prime plus per annum  subject to a minimum rate of 
in addition  we may purchase and finance information technology products from ge approved vendors on terms that depend upon certain variable factors 
a substantial portion of such purchases from ge approved vendors have been on terms that allow interest free flooring 
the financing agreements contain various liquidity financial covenants  including  without limitation  that ebitda be sufficient to cover a multiple of times interest expense for a rolling twelve month period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september  the ge facility is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and substantially all of our other assets 
as of september   approximately million in borrowings were outstanding under our million financing facility 
at september   we had additional borrowings available of approximately million after taking into consideration the temporary increase of million granted by ge through october  and the available collateral and borrowing limitations under the agreements 
as discussed in the overview section above  after having recorded modest earnings in the last two fiscal years we have begun a reversal of the million in losses that we accumulated in fiscal years through to accomplish that  in the second quarter of fiscal year  our chairman and ceo replaced key executives and resumed his role as our president with day to day responsibilities 
he refocused our sales strategy to a more aggressive face to face style  encouraged selling of higher margin managed services  and enhanced our sales opportunities by qualifying us as a minority owned business 
we evaluated smaller competitors that could be accretive to our earnings as potential acquisition candidates 
to return us to the low cost operational overhead model under which we had previously succeeded  we contracted with off shore firms to provide back office operational and accounting related services at rates substantially discounted to those available in the us management believes its turn around plans will continue to be successful in improving our sales and profitability 
however  if we are unable to maintain compliance with our loan covenants and if such noncompliance is not waived by ge  the working capital line of credit could be revoked prior to its expiration date 
in such eventuality  we believe that we have sufficient working capital to enable us to continue to operate through at least september  however  we would be required to significantly scale down our business plans if we were unable to obtain alternative sources of financing
