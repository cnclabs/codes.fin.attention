item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report on form k 
if we do not succeed in maintaining or increasing our revenues  our losses may recur 
we may need to raise capital in the future to invest in the growth of our business and to fund necessary expenditures 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
see part i 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our principal fixed commitments consist of obligations under a credit agreement  obligations under capital leases  obligations under office space leases  accounts payable and other current obligations  commitments for capital expenditures and commitments for telecommunications services 
for each of the five years ended december     and  we received a report from our independent accountants containing an explanatory paragraph stating that we have a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may need additional financing to invest in the growth of our business and to pay other obligations  and the availability of such financing when needed  on terms acceptable to us  or at all  is uncertain 
see risk factors we have incurred significant indebtedness for money borrowed  and we may be unable to pay debt service on this indebtedness 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  generate sufficient cash flow  or restructure our debt obligations before they become due and payable  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities  stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest 
the amount of dilution resulting from issuance of additional shares of class a common stock and securities convertible into class a common stock and the potential dilution that may result from future issuances has significantly increased in light of the decline in our stock price 
moreover  we could issue preferred stock that has rights senior to those of the class a common stock 
some of our stockholders have registration rights that could interfere with our ability to raise needed capital 
if we raise funds by issuing debt  our lenders may place limitations on our operations  including our ability to pay dividends  although we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future 
we have incurred significant indebtedness for money borrowed  and we may be unable to pay debt service on this indebtedness 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in subordinated convertible notes due in  a term loan of million payable over years  obligations under office space leases  and commitments for telecommunications services 
we currently have million in principal payments  including in payments on the subordinated convertible notes which was made on february   and additional amounts in interest payments due during the twelve month period after december  our credit facility with wells fargo requires us to maintain minimum specified levels of ebitda and prohibits us from incurring capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts 
see management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources contained in this filing on form k and subsequent filings with the sec 
we recently received a waiver of the capital expenditures covenant for we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay interest and other amounts due on our outstanding indebtedness  or our other obligations  on the scheduled dates or at all 
if our cash flow and cash balances are inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we otherwise fail to comply with any covenants in our indebtedness such as the ebitda or capital expenditures covenants  we would be in default under these obligations  which would permit these lenders to accelerate the maturity of the obligations and could cause defaults under our indebtedness 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due on our indebtedness if payment of the indebtedness were accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default under  or certain other events specified in  the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and capital leases 
the elimination of outstanding debt pursuant to our debt restructuring completed in and prior years resulted in substantial cancellation of debt income for income tax purposes 
we intend to minimize income tax payable as a result of the restructuring by  among other things  offsetting the income with our historical net operating losses and otherwise reducing the income in accordance with applicable income tax rules 
as a result  we do not expect to incur any material current income tax liability from the elimination of this debt 
however  the relevant tax authorities may challenge our income tax positions  including the use of our historical net operating losses to offset some or all of the cancellation of debt income and the application of the income tax rules reducing the cancellation of debt income 
if we are not able to offset or otherwise reduce the cancellation of debt income  we may incur material income tax liabilities as a result of the elimination of debt and we may be unable to pay these liabilities 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness  make it difficult to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
where resources permit  we intend to continue to acquire  or make strategic investments in  other businesses and acquire or license technology and other assets and we may have difficulty integrating these businesses or generating an acceptable return 
we have completed a number of acquisitions and strategic investments since our initial public offering in for example  we acquired netmoves corporation  a provider of production messaging services and integrated desktop messaging services to businesses 
we also acquired swift telecommunications  inc and the easylink services business that it had contemporaneously acquired from at t corp 
where resources permit  we will continue our efforts to acquire or make strategic investments in businesses and to acquire or license technology and other assets  and any of these acquisitions may be material to us 
we cannot assure you that acquisition or licensing opportunities will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
such acquisitions involve risks  including inability to raise the required capital  difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and personnel  inability to retain any acquired member or customer accounts  disruption of our ongoing business  the need for additional capital to fund losses of acquired businesses  inability to successfully incorporate acquired technology into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and lack of the necessary experience to enter new markets 
we may not successfully overcome problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by diluting our stockholders equity  causing us to incur additional debt or requiring us to incur acquisition expenses or amortize or depreciate acquired intangible and tangible assets or to incur impairment charges as a result of the write off of assets  including goodwill  recorded as a result of such acquisition 
we may be unable to successfully complete the migration of the network relating to our business acquired from at t off of at t premises 
on february   we completed the acquisition of swift telecommunications  inc which had contemporaneously acquired the easylink services business of at t corp 
the easylink services business acquired from at t provides a variety of transaction delivery services 
this business was a division of at t and was not a separate independent operating entity 
under a transition services agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition  at t agreed to provide us with a variety of services to enable us to continue to operate the business pending the transition to easylink 
we have successfully transitioned virtually all of these services provided by at t under the transition services agreement to ourselves  including customer service  network operations center  telex switching equipment and services and office space in a variety of locations 
the transition services agreement expired on january  however  the network for the portion of this business relating to edi  fax and email services continues to reside on at t s premises under an agreement with at t  but is being operated and maintained by easylink 
this agreement expires on january   and at t has informed us that they will not extend the agreement beyond this date 
if we are unable to extend the agreement  we will need to either migrate the network off of the at t premises to easylink s premises or migrate the customers to a replacement network 
as a result  we have begun the build out of a new network center at our corporate headquarters located in piscataway  new jersey and have commenced the planning process for the migration of these operations to this center 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully migrate the remaining easylink services customers or network from at t s premises to our own premises  or successfully integrate them into our operations  in a timely manner or without incurring substantial unforeseen expense or without service interruption to our customers 
even if successfully migrated  we may be unable to operate the business at expense levels that are ultimately profitable for us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain all of the customers of the easylink services business 
our inability to successfully migrate  integrate or operate the network and operations  or to retain customers  of the easylink services business will result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
outsourcing of transaction management services may not prove to be a viable business 
an important part of our business strategy is to leverage our existing global customer base and global network by continuing to provide our existing transaction delivery services and by offering these customers additional transaction delivery and new transaction management services in the future 
the market for transaction management services is only beginning to develop 
our success will depend on the development of viable markets for the outsourcing of new transaction management services which is somewhat speculative 
there are significant obstacles to the full development of a sizable market for the outsourcing of transaction management services 
outsourcing is one of the principal methods by which we will attempt to reach the size we believe is necessary to be successful 
security and the reliability of service  however  are likely to be of concern to enterprises and service providers deciding whether to outsource their transaction management or to continue to provide it themselves 
these concerns are likely to be particularly strong at larger businesses and service providers  which are better able to afford the costs of maintaining their own systems 
while we intend to focus exclusively on our outsourced transaction delivery and transaction management services  we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or expand our business customer base 
in addition  the sales cycle for many of these services is lengthy and could delay our ability to generate revenues in this market 
our strategy of developing and offering to existing customers additional transaction delivery and transaction management services may be unsuccessful 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to develop and offer to existing customers additional transaction delivery and transaction management services that will automate more of our customers business processes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop these additional services in a timely manner or at all or  if developed  that our customers will purchase these services or will purchase them at prices that we wish to charge 
standards for pricing in the market for new transaction delivery and transaction management services are not yet well defined and some businesses and service providers may not be willing to pay the fees we wish to charge 
we cannot assure you that the fees we intend to charge will be sufficient to offset the related costs of providing these services 
we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which would cause our stock price to decline 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
it is likely that our operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
in this event  the price of our class a common stock is likely to decline 
the following are among the factors that could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results incurrence of other cash and non cash accounting charges  including charges resulting from acquisitions or dispositions of assets  including from the disposition of our remaining non core assets  and write downs of impaired assets  increases or decreases in the number of transactions generated by our customers such as insurance claims  trade and travel confirmations  purchase orders  invoices  shipping notices  funds transfers  among others  which is affected by factors that affect specific customers  the respective industries in which our customers conduct business and the economy generally  non cash charges associated with the adoption of sfas r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments and employee stock options beginning in the third quarter of  system outages  delays in obtaining new equipment or problems with planned upgrades  disruption or impairment of the internet  demand for outsourced transaction delivery and transaction management services  attracting and retaining customers and maintaining customer satisfaction  introduction of new or enhanced services by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policy or that of our competitors  changes in governmental regulation of the internet and transaction delivery and transaction management services in particular  and general economic and market conditions and global political factors 
we may incur significant stock based compensation charges related to repriced options if our stock price rises above 
in light of the decline in our stock price and in an effort to retain our employee base  on november   the company offered to certain of its employees  officers and directors  other than gerald gorman  the right to reprice certain outstanding stock options to an exercise price equal to per share  the closing price of the company s class a common stock on nasdaq on november  as adjusted for our reverse stock split effected on january  options to purchase  shares were repriced 
the repriced options vest at the same rate that they would have vested under their original terms 
in march  financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
interpretation 
among other issues  this interpretation clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
as a result  under the interpretation  stock options repriced after december  are subject to variable plan accounting treatment 
this guidance requires the company to remeasure compensation cost for outstanding repriced options each reporting period based on changes in the market value of the underlying common stock 
if our stock price rises above the exercise price of the repriced options  this accounting treatment may result in significant non cash compensation charges in future periods 
several of our competitors have substantially greater resources  longer operating histories  larger customer bases and broader product offerings 
our business is  and we believe will continue to be  intensely competitive 
see part i item business competition contained in this form k and subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
many of our competitors have greater market presence  engineering and marketing capabilities  and financial  technological and personnel resources than those available to us 
as a result  they may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition to direct competitors  many of our larger potential customers may seek to internally fulfill their messaging needs through the deployment of their own on premises messaging systems 
some of our competitors provide a variety of telecommunications services and other business services  as well as software and hardware solutions  in addition to transaction delivery or transaction management services 
the ability of these competitors to offer a broader suite of complementary services and software or hardware may give them a considerable advantage over us 
the level of competition is likely to increase as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
in the future  as we expand our service offerings  we expect to encounter increased competition in the development and delivery of these services 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
it is difficult to retain key personnel and attract additional qualified employees in our business and the loss of key personnel and the burden of attracting additional qualified employees may impede the operation and growth of our business and cause our revenues to decline 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  but they have no contractual obligation to remain with us 
in particular  our success depends on the continued service of thomas f 
murawski  our president and chief executive officer  and michael a 
doyle  our vice president and chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of messrs 
murawski or of mr 
doyle  or several other key employees  would impede the operation and growth of our business 
to manage our existing business and handle any future growth  we will have to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees 
in particular  we will need to hire and retain qualified sales people if we are to meet our sales goals 
we will also need to hire and retain additional experienced and skilled technical personnel in order to meet the increasing technical demands of our expanding business 
competition for employees in messaging related businesses is intense 
we have in the past experienced  and expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we are unable to do so  our management may not be able to effectively manage our business  exploit opportunities and respond to competitive challenges 
our business is heavily dependent on technology  including technology that has not yet been proven reliable at high traffic levels and technology that we do not control 
the performance of our computer systems is critical to the quality of service we are able to provide to our customers 
if our services are unavailable or fail to perform to their satisfaction  customers may cease using our service 
in addition  our agreements with several of our customers establish minimum performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their relationships with us and assert claims for service fee rebates or monetary damages 
we may need to upgrade some of our computer systems to accommodate increases in traffic and to accommodate increases in the usage of our services  but we may not be able to do so while maintaining our current level of service  or at all 
we must continue to expand and adapt our computer systems as the number of customers and the amount of information they wish to transmit increases and as their requirements change  and as we further develop our services 
because we have only been providing some of our services for a limited time  and because our computer systems for these services have not been tested at greater capacities  we cannot guarantee the ability of our computer systems to connect and manage a substantially larger number of customers or meet the needs of business customers at high transmission speeds 
if we cannot provide the necessary service while maintaining expected performance  our business would suffer and our ability to generate revenues through our services would be impaired 
the expansion and adaptation of our computer systems will require substantial financial  operational and managerial resources 
we may not be able to accurately project the timing of increases in traffic or other customer requirements 
in addition  the very process of upgrading our computer systems could cause service disruptions 
for example  we may need to take various elements of the network out of service in order to install some upgrades 
our computer systems may fail and interrupt our service 
our customers have in the past experienced interruptions in our services 
we believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions are due to hardware failures  failures in telecommunications and other services provided to us by third parties and other computer system failures 
these failures have resulted and may continue to result in significant disruptions to our service 
some of our operations have redundant switch over capability 
although we plan to install backup computers and implement procedures on other parts of our operations to reduce the impact of future malfunctions in these systems  the presence of single points of failure in our network increases the risk of service interruptions 
in addition  substantially all of our computer and communications systems relating to our services are currently located in glen head  new york  jersey city  new jersey  piscataway  new jersey  washington  dc  bridgeton  missouri  dayton  ohio  and london  england 
we currently do not have alternate sites from which we could conduct these operations in the event of a disaster 
our computer and communications hardware is vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
our services would be suspended for a significant period of time if any of our primary data centers was severely damaged or destroyed 
we might also lose customer transaction documents and other customer files  causing significant customer dissatisfaction and possibly giving rise to claims for monetary damages 
we plan to consolidate over time an increasing portion of our computer systems and networks  including the migration of the network equipment from the leased at t facility to our corporate headquarters 
this consolidation may result in interruptions in our services to some of our customers 
our services will become less desirable or obsolete if we are unable to keep up with the rapid changes characteristic of our business 
our success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing services and to introduce new services in order to adapt to rapidly changing technologies  industry standards and customer demands 
to compete successfully  we will have to accurately anticipate changes in business demand and add new features to our services very rapidly 
we may not be able to develop or integrate the necessary technology into our computer systems on a timely basis or without degrading the performance of our existing services 
we cannot be sure that  once integrated  new technology will function as expected 
delays in introducing effective new services could cause existing and potential customers to forego use of our services 
our business will suffer if we are unable to provide adequate security for our service  or if our service is impaired by security measures imposed by third parties 
security is a critical issue for any outsourced transaction delivery or transaction management service  and presents a number of challenges for us 
if we are unable to maintain the security of our service  our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers may suffer  and we may be exposed to liability 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers whose networks we may maintain or for whom we provide services 
if they are successful  they could obtain information that is sensitive or confidential to a customer or otherwise disrupt a customer s operations or obtain confidential information  including our customer s profiles  passwords  financial account information  credit card numbers  message content  stored email or other personal or business information or similar information relating to our customer s customers 
our customers or their employees or customers may assert claims for money damages for any breach in our security and any breach could harm our reputation 
our computers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar incursions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we expect to expend significant capital and other resources to license or create encryption and other technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
nevertheless  these measures may prove ineffective 
our failure to prevent security breaches may expose us to liability and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and develop our business market 
security measures taken by others may interfere with the efficient operation of our service  which may harm our reputation and adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers 
firewalls and similar network security software employed by third parties can interfere with the operation of our services 
our customers are subject to  and in turn require that their service providers meet  increasingly strict guidelines for network and operational security 
if we are unable to meet the security requirements of a customer  we may be unable to obtain or keep their business 
this is particularly the case for customers in the health insurance and financial services industries  which are subject to legal requirements governing the security and confidentiality of customer information 
we are dependent on licensed technology and third party commercial partners 
we license a significant amount of technology from third parties  including technology related to our internet fax services  billing processes and databases 
we also rely on third party commercial partners to provide services for our trading community enablement services  document capture and management services and some of our other services 
we anticipate that we will need to license additional technology or to enter into additional commercial relationships to remain competitive 
we may not be able to license these technologies or to enter into arrangements with prospective commercial partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
third party licenses and strategic commercial relationships expose us to increased risks  including risks relating to the integration of new technology  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  a greater need to generate revenues sufficient to offset associated license or service fee costs  and the possible termination of or failure to renew an important license or other agreement by the third party licensor or commercial partner 
if the internet and other third party networks on which we depend to deliver our services become ineffective as a means of transmitting data  the benefits of our service may be severely undermined 
our business depends on the effectiveness of the internet as a means of transmitting data 
the recent growth in the use of the internet has caused frequent interruptions and delays in accessing and transmitting data over the internet 
any deterioration in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of our services 
therefore  our success depends on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion 
we also depend on telecommunications network suppliers such as at t corporation  mci and xo communications for a variety of telecommunications and internet services 
the network for the easylink services business acquired from at t continues to reside on at t s premises 
see risk factors we may be unable to successfully complete the migration of the network relating to our business acquired from at t off of at t premises above  item business technology contained in this form k and subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our international operations are subject to significant risks and our operating results may suffer if our revenues from international operations do not exceed the costs of those operations 
we operate in international markets 
we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets 
if our revenues from international operations do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our operating results will suffer 
we face significant risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as uncertain demand in foreign markets for transaction delivery and transaction management services  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  differing technology standards  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  economic instability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  potentially adverse tax consequences  regulatory limitations on the activities in which we can engage and foreign ownership limitations on our ability to hold an interest in entities through which we wish to conduct business  political instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  export restrictions  terrorism  and difficulties in enforcing contracts and potentially adverse consequences 
regulation of transaction delivery and transaction management services and internet use is evolving and may adversely impact our business 
currently  few laws or regulations specifically regulate activity on the internet 
with some exceptions  online activity is not subject to laws and regulations that differ from those applicable to offline activities 
in cases where online activity is subject to unique regulatory regimes  those regulatory approaches currently tend to be less burdensome than their offline counterparts 
laws and regulations may  however  be adopted in the future to address issues such as user privacy  pricing  and the characteristics and quality of products and services in the online context specifically  or to impose traditional regulatory paradigms on online activity 
the federal communications commission fcc is currently considering whether to impose certain regulations on some entities that provide service using the internet or internet protocol ip  including but not limited to voice over internet protocol voip telephony 
such potential rules could include requirements to provide enhanced capability  ensure access for disabled persons  cooperate with law enforcement  contribute to universal service funds  and pay for using the public telephone network 
any of these requirements  if applicable to a given service  could increase the cost of providing that service 
it cannot yet be predicted whether those rules will be adopted at all and  if so  whether they would be applied to our non voice services 
the company and its customers are subject to laws and regulations protecting personal and other confidential information in connection with the exchange of this information by these customers using the company s services 
at present  in the united states  interactive internet based service providers have substantial legal protection for the transmission of third party content that is infringing  defamatory  pornographic  or otherwise illegal 
we cannot guarantee that a us court would not conclude that we do not qualify for these protections as an interactive service provider 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated and received by users of our services or the recipients of messages delivered through our services 
some foreign governments  such as germany and france  have enforced content related laws and regulations against internet service providers 
we believe that our services are information services under the telecommunications act of and related precedent and therefore would not currently be subject to traditional us telecommunication services regulation 
although the fcc has indicated that it views internet based services as being interstate and subject to the protection of federal laws that warrant preemption of state efforts to impose traditional common carrier regulation on such services  the fcc s efforts are currently under legal challenge and we cannot predict the outcome of state efforts to regulate such services or the scope of federal policy to preempt such efforts 
while the fcc historically has refrained from regulating ip based communications  it has also sought comment about whether and to what extent it should regulate such communications in the future 
continued changes in telecommunications regulations may significantly reduce the cost of domestic and international calls 
to the extent that the cost of domestic and international calls decreases  we will face increased competition for our fax services which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
fcc regulations require providers of telecommunications services to contribute to the universal service fund  a fund established to subsidize telecommunications service in rural areas in the united states 
such providers are authorized to then pass those contribution costs on to their customers  our costs for telecommunications services that we purchase thus reflect these amounts 
the contributions are currently calculated as a percentage of telecommunications services revenues 
alternative contribution methodologies  such as the imposition of a fee per telephone line  and other changes have been proposed that could increase these amounts and thus our costs in purchasing such telecommunications services 
if adopted  these changes may in turn require us to raise the price of one or more of our services to our customers 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover all or part of any increase in costs that may result from these changes if adopted by the fcc or that such changes will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for our services 
in connection with the deployment of internet capable nodes in countries throughout the world  we are required to satisfy a variety of foreign regulatory requirements 
we intend to explore and seek to comply with these requirements on a country by country basis as the deployment of internet capable fax nodes continues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the regulatory requirements in each of these countries  and the failure to satisfy such requirements may prevent us from installing internet capable fax nodes in such countries or require us to limit the functionality of such nodes 
the failure to deploy a number of such nodes could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our fax nodes and telex switches utilize encryption technology 
the export of such encryption technology is regulated by the united states government 
we have authority for the export of such encryption technology other than to countries such as cuba  iran  libya  syria  sudan and north korea 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that such authority will not be revoked or modified at any time for any particular jurisdiction or in general 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such export controls  either in their current form or as may be subsequently enacted  will not limit our ability to distribute our services outside of the united states or electronically 
while we take precautions against unlawful exportation of our software  the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to effectively control the distribution of our services 
moreover  future federal or state legislation or regulation may further limit levels of encryption or authentication technology 
any such export restrictions  the unlawful exportation of our services  or new legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the legal structure and scope of operations of our subsidiaries in some foreign countries may be subject to restrictions that could severely limit our ability to conduct business in these countries 
to the extent that we develop or offer messaging or other services in foreign countries  we will be subject to the laws and regulations of these countries 
the laws and regulations relating to the internet and telecommunications services in many countries are evolving and in many cases are more burdensome than us law and or unclear as to their application 
for example  in india  the prc  and other countries  we may be subject to licensing requirements with respect to the activities in which we propose to engage and we may also be subject to foreign ownership limitations or other approval requirements that preclude our ownership interests or limit our ownership interests to up to specified percentages of the entities through which we propose to conduct any regulated activities 
if these limitations apply to our activities including activities conducted through our subsidiaries  our opportunities to generate revenue will be reduced  our ability to compete successfully in these markets will be adversely affected  our ability to raise capital in the private and public markets may be adversely affected  and the value of our investments and acquisitions in these markets may decline 
moreover  to the extent we are limited in our ability to engage in certain activities or are required to contract for these services from a licensed or authorized third party  our costs of providing our services will increase and our ability to generate profits may be adversely affected 
our intellectual property rights are critical to our success  but may be difficult to protect 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  domain names and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  strategic partners and others to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our precautions  unauthorized third parties may improperly obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
third parties may submit false registration data attempting to transfer key domain names to their control 
our failure to pay annual registration fees for domain names may result in the loss of these domains to third parties 
the status of united states patent protection for software products and services is not well defined and will evolve as additional patents are granted 
we have applied for a patent for some of our services  and we do not know if our application will be issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  other parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us 
we cannot be certain that our services do not infringe issued patents 
because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our services 
we have been and may continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  including claims related to the use of our domain names and claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may incur expenses and liabilities as a result of pending legal proceedings 
the company is involved in legal proceedings that may result in additional expenses or liability 
see legal proceedings contained in part i  item of this form k and subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these proceedings include a broker s fee dispute in which the company is appealing a  judgment imposed on it and a claim for indemnification and contribution by a defendant in an unsolicited commercial fax lawsuit 
although the company intends to pursue its defense of these matters vigorously  no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
to the extent that the company is not successful in appealing the judgment or defending the indemnification and contribution claim  it will be required to pay the judgment in the broker s fee dispute or to pay any judgment that may be rendered in such claim 
the company has already paid  into a trust account to secure the payment of the judgment relating to the broker fee if the judgment is upheld on appeal 
although we intend to defend vigorously these matters  we cannot assure you that our ultimate liability  if any  in connection with these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
a substantial amount of our common stock may come onto the market in the future  which could depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
as of february   we had an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock outstanding 
as of february   we had options to purchase  shares of class a common stock outstanding and warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock outstanding 
as of february   substantially all of the shares of our outstanding class a common stock were freely tradable  in some cases subject to the volume and manner of sale limitations contained in rule we may issue large amounts of additional class a common stock  which may also be sold and which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
approximately million of our outstanding shares were issued in connection with the elimination of debt during the nine months ended september  if the holders of these shares sell large numbers of shares  these holders could cause the price of our class a common stock to fall 
the holders of approximately million shares of outstanding class a common stock and the holders of million shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants had the right  subject to various conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or for other stockholders 
by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares  these holders could cause the price of the class a common stock to fall 
an undetermined number of these shares have been sold publicly pursuant to rule our class a common stock may be subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
our class a common stock may face potential delisting from the nasdaq national market which could hurt the liquidity of our class a common stock 
we may be unable to comply with the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
these standards require  among other things  that our class a common stock have a minimum bid price of specifically  an issuer will be considered non compliant with the minimum bid price requirement only if it fails to satisfy the applicable requirement for consecutive business days 
it would then be afforded a calendar day grace period in which to regain compliance 
if a national market issuer does not regain compliance with the day period  it may transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market  provided that it meets all applicable requirements for initial inclusion on the smallcap market other than the minimum bid price requirement  or it can request a hearing to remain on the national market 
in addition  the listing standards require that we maintain compliance with various other standards  including market capitalization or total assets and total revenue  number of publicly held shares  which are shares held by persons who are not officers  directors or beneficial owners of of our outstanding shares  and market value of publicly held shares 
alternatively  we can comply with certain other standards  including a million minimum stockholders equity requirement 
the minimum bid price of our stock was below during various periods prior to july  and from april  
through the date of the filing of this report on form k 
if we are unable to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price  we may be subject to delisting 
we had a total stockholders equity in the amount of million as of december  in comparison to the million minimum total stockholders equity requirement 
an alternative listing standard to the minimum total stockholders equity standard requires that we maintain a minimum market value of our publicly held shares of not less than million 
as of the filing of this form k  we were in compliance with the million minimum market value of publicly held shares alternative standard 
there can be no assurance that easylink will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or that it will maintain compliance with the other listing standards  including the minimum total stockholders equity requirement or the million minimum market value of publicly held shares requirement 
easylink notified nasdaq on october  that  if easylink did not appoint another independent director to its board on or before november   easylink would no longer be in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c  which requires that a majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors as defined in nasdaq marketplace rule since that time and through the first quarter of  easylink appointed three additional independent directors and two management directors have departed 
accordingly  easylink now has six independent directors and one management director on its board and has regained compliance with nasdaq s independent director requirements 
if our common stock were to be delisted from trading on the nasdaq national market and were neither re listed thereon nor listed for trading on the nasdaq small cap market or other recognized securities exchange  trading  if any  in the class a common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the non nasdaq over the counter market 
delisting would result in limited release of the market price of the class a common stock and limited news coverage of easylink and could restrict investors interest in our class a common stock and materially adversely affect the trading market and prices for our class a common stock and our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
our stock price has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile 
our stock price has been volatile since our initial public offering and we expect that it will continue to be volatile 
as discussed above  our financial results are difficult to predict and could fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the market prices of securities of electronic services companies have been highly volatile 
a stock s price is often influenced by rapidly changing perceptions about the future of electronic services or the results of other internet or technology companies  rather than specific developments relating to the issuer of that particular stock 
as a result of volatility in our stock price  a securities class action may be brought against us 
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources

overview we are a provider of services that facilitate the electronic exchange of information between enterprises  their trading communities and their customers 
on an average business day  we handle approximately one million transactions that are integral to the movement of money  materials  products and people in the global economy such as insurance claims  trade and travel confirmations  purchase orders  invoices  shipping notices and funds transfers  among many others 
we offer a broad range of information exchange services to businesses and service providers  including transaction management services and transaction delivery services 
transaction management services consist of integrated desktop messaging services and document capture and management services such as fax to database  fax to data and data conversion services 
beginning in  we will also offer as a transaction management service an enhanced production messaging service that we call easylink production messaging pm service 
transaction delivery services consist of electronic data interchange or edi  and basic production messaging services utilizing email  fax and telex 
as part of our strategy  we will seek to upgrade customers who are using our basic production messaging service to our enhanced production messaging service known as easylink production messaging pm service 
see part i  item  business company overview contained in this form k 
until july   we also offered mailwatch services to protect corporate e mail systems  which included virus protection  spam control and content filtering services 
revenues for the year ended december  total revenues were million in comparison to million in and million in as detailed in the schedule below the declines in revenue in and as compared to the prior years were attributable to lower revenues in our transaction delivery services amounting to million or in as compared to and million or in as compared to  and million in lower mailwatch revenues in as a result of the sale of this service line as of july  these declines were partially offset by increased revenues in our transaction management services of million in representing growth over and million representing growth in as compared to percent change vs

transaction management services    transaction delivery services    mailwatch    transaction delivery services have been continually impacted by pricing pressures in the telecommunications market and by technological factors that replace or reduce the deployment of such services by our customers 
this has led to lower volumes  negotiated individual customer price reductions at the time of service contract renewals and the loss of certain customers 
although we have focused efforts on stabilizing this revenue stream  we believe the trend will continue throughout we will seek to expand our newer transaction management services and to upgrade customers who are using our basic production messaging services to our enhanced production messaging service  easylink production messaging pm service  to offset the declines so that total company revenues can be positioned to grow beginning in operating results our operating results have continued to improve in and even though revenues declined in comparison to prior years 
income from operations amounted to million including million of gains on the sale of our mailwatch service line and our domain assets in in comparison to losses from operations of million in and million in the loss included million in impairment of intangible asset charges 
income from continuing operations amounted to million in in comparison to million in but the prior year s results included million in gains on debt restructuring and settlements while included only million in such gains 
inclusive of the impairment charges  the net loss in amounted to million 
we have heightened our efforts to increase revenues from transaction management services during the fourth quarter of and during to date by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and undertaking certain promotional programs 
while other costs have been reduced  we expect that our overall results for will be negatively impacted by this effort and we expect that results for the year will fall short of s results 
furthermore  we will record approximately million of charges  net of taxes  in for the separation agreement with our former president of the international division and severance expenses related to restructuring certain operations 
our prospects should be considered in light of risks described in the section of this report entitled risk factors that may affect future results 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to accounts receivable  long lived assets and intangible assets  contingencies and litigation  and restructurings 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
impairment of long lived assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually unless events occur that require more frequent reviews 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess indefinite lived intangible impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess long lived asset impairment 
if an assessment indicates impairment  the impaired asset is written down to its fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured with discounted estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts 
on an on going basis  management reviews the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
during this review  we reevaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets 
although the assumptions may vary from transaction to transaction  they generally include revenue growth  operating results  cash flows and other indicators of value 
management then determines whether there has been an impairment of the value of long lived assets based upon events or circumstances  which have occurred since acquisition 
the impairment policy is consistently applied in evaluating impairment for each of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and investments 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
restructuring activities restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and  in and  relate to the relocation and consolidation of our new jersey office facilities into one location and a similar consolidation of our office facilities in england 
the restructuring charges are comprised of abandonment costs with respect to leases  including the write off of leasehold improvements 
we continually evaluate the amounts established in the restructuring reserve so that amounts originally recorded in were increased in based on market conditions for subleasing the abandoned facilities 
in  mostly due to a settlement of liability related to one of our abandoned locations   of restructuring charges was reversed 
our obligations for the remaining abandoned locations terminate in september and february results of operations  and percent change vs

we anticipate that our revenues derived from our transaction delivery services will continue to decline  while our transaction management services revenue is expected to increase in cost of revenues cost of revenues for decreased to million from million in as a percentage of revenues these costs decreased to in as compared to in cost of revenue reflects a decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue equal to due to depreciation charges and decrease in other costs as a percentage of revenues equal to 
reduction in other costs include savings from continuing cost reduction programs in network operations  lower telecom rates  favorable settlement dispute  reductions in facilities  including reducing the number of circuits  and reduced variable telecom charges consistent with reduced customer volumes 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs incurred in the delivery and support of our services  including depreciation of equipment used in our computer systems  software license costs  tele housing costs  the cost of telecommunications services including local access charges  leased network backbone circuit costs and long distance domestic and international termination charges  and personnel costs associated with our systems and databases 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased to million from million in the increased expense relates to our increased staff and promotional program spending particularly in the latter part of  to expand transaction management services 
we expect these expenses to continue at the increased levels throughout and for total sales and marketing costs to be higher than that of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in while certain cost components may vary  we anticipate general and administrative expenses in total to be comparable to levels 
product development expenses product development costs  which consist primarily of personnel and consultants time and expense to research  conceptualize  and test product launches and enhancements to our products  were million for as compared to million in we anticipate that spending for product development will increase over in connection with the expansion of the development of the new transaction management services and the continuing development of other services 
restructuring charges during the year ended december   the company recorded additional restructuring charges of million for net abandonment costs on us leases as estimated sublease rentals were reduced due to deteriorating market conditions for subleasing the vacant facilities and a negotiated settlement of lease obligations in england 
during these estimates were revised again  largely due to a favorable negotiated settlement of liability on one lease  resulting in the reversal of restructuring charges of  amortization of intangible assets as of january   the company adopted fasb no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
statement no 
requires companies to no longer amortize goodwill but instead to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
accordingly  we did not amortize any goodwill during the years ended december  and respectively 
we completed an impairment assessment in the th quarter of with the assistance of an independent appraiser and determined that an impairment of trademarks had occurred 
accordingly we recorded a  charge in the value of the trademark is based upon the company s ability to continue to generate revenues at comparable levels and based upon certain other assumptions 
significant declines in revenues or changes in assumptions could negatively impact the value of the trademark 
our annual assessment for did not result in any impairment 
interest income expense  net interest income for was  as compared to  during the increase was due to higher cash balances available for temporary investment 
interest expense was  in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to reductions in the total debt balances outstanding as a result of the debt restructurings and settlements completed in and principal amortization in gain on debt restructurings and settlements in december we paid off all of the company s previously existing secured debt with part of the proceeds of a new million term loan from wells fargo 
as a result  we recorded a gain of million from the reversal of interest previously capitalized related to the retired debt 
during  we eliminated million of indebtedness in exchange for the payment of million in cash and the issuance of million shares of class a common stock valued at million pursuant to our announced efforts to eliminate substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness 
after reversing million of previously capitalized interest and million of accrued interest net of debt issuance costs  we recorded total gains of million on these transactions 
the elimination of outstanding debt in resulted in substantial income from cancellation of debt for income tax purposes 
we intend to minimize the income tax payable as a result of the restructuring by  among other things  offsetting the income with our historical net operating losses and otherwise reducing the income in accordance with applicable income tax rules 
we do not expect to incur any material current income tax liability from the elimination of this debt  although the relevant tax authorities may challenge our income tax positions 
results of operations and revenues revenues in were million as compared to million in the decrease of million was due primarily to reduced revenues in our production messaging services  which include fax  telex and email hosting  as a result of lower volumes and negotiated individual customer price reductions and loss of certain customers 
revenues consist almost entirely of revenues from providing information exchange services to businesses and are derived from electronic data interchange services or edi  production messaging services  integrated desktop messaging services  boundary and managed email services  and other services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for decreased to million from million in as a percentage of revenues these costs decreased to in as compared to in however  the costs are net of a million of revenues reversal of previously accrued telecom costs as a result of a negotiated agreement with one of the company s providers 
without the reversal  costs as a percentage of revenue would have remained unchanged at 
cost of revenue reflects a decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue equal to due to depreciation charges and an increase in other costs as a percentage of revenues equal to due to fixed network expenses and fixed telecom expenses 
reductions in costs from continuing cost reduction programs in network operations  telecom rates  reductions in facilities  including reducing the number of circuits  and reduced variable telecom charges consistent with reduced customer volumes also reduced total costs in comparison to cost of revenues consists primarily of costs incurred in the delivery and support of our services  including depreciation of equipment used in our computer systems  the cost of telecommunications services including local access charges  leased network backbone circuit costs and long distance domestic and international termination charges  and personnel costs associated with our systems and databases 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
included in this category are costs related to salaries and commissions for sales  marketing  and business development personnel 
also included are costs for promotional programs  trade shows and marketing materials 
the cost decrease of million is primarily the result of lower staffing levels in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the million decrease is the net impact of various cost component changes but the most significant reduction was million in our provision for bad debts as a result of improved collection and credit activities 
product development expenses product development costs  which consist primarily of personnel and consultants time and expense to research  conceptualize  and test product launches and enhancements to our products  were million for as compared to million in the net decrease in costs mostly relates to lower consultants costs and lower salaries attributable to fewer employees 
restructuring charges during the year ended december   restructuring charges of million were recorded by the company 
the company s restructuring initiatives are related to the relocation and consolidation of its new jersey office facilities into one location which was completed in and a similar consolidation of facilities for our operations in england 
the restructuring charges are comprised of net abandonment cost with respect to leases and the write off of leasehold improvements 
during the year ended december   the company recorded additional restructuring charges of million for net abandonment costs on us leases as estimated sublease rentals were reduced due to deteriorating market conditions for subleasing the vacant facilities and a negotiated settlement of lease obligations in england 
gain on sale of business in  the company recorded a  gain attributable to the sale of customer contracts for hosted email services nims and a  gain attributable to the sale of a software and consulting business in europe

liquidity and capital resources we have significantly improved our financial condition in and by reducing operating costs by consolidating operations and other cost reduction programs  restructuring our debt obligations and entering into a new credit financing with wells fargo  and selling our non core domain assets and our mailwatch service line 
at december  our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million  a million increase in comparison to balances on hand at december  our working capital deficit at year end was  in comparison to million at december  and million at december  in addition  our stockholders equity reached million at december  from million at december  and from a deficit of million at december  in december we entered into an agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc  a subsidiary of wells fargo  for a credit facility of million  including a million term loan 
we used million of the proceeds from the term loan to pay off all our secured debt  which included a scheduled balloon payment of million in june  in december and we used an additional million of proceeds to pay off subordinated debt in february the wells fargo term loan is repayable at  per month for months although there are mandatory prepayments under certain conditions 
the credit facility also provides for other advances of million initially  but increasing to million upon our meeting certain conditions 
we borrowed approximately million of advances in march for working capital purposes 
see note loans and notes payable for a description of the wells fargo foothill credit facility 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalent balances  the availability of funds under the credit facility and cash from operations will provide adequate funds for operating and other planned expenditures and debt service  including the expansion of our sales and marketing force and our capital spending programs  for at least the next twelve months 
cash provided from operations amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we anticipate that our operating results for will approximate these levels  we expect to increase spending for capital expenditures requiring the use of available funds 
we estimate spending million for capital expenditures in  mostly related to the build out of a new network center at our corporate office location in piscataway  nj and the migration of customer messaging to the new facility from a leased at t location 
the new network installation is expected to result in reduced network operating costs once the migration is completed in the first quarter of capital expenditures amounted to million including million under capital leases in and million in other major uses of cash in are approximately million in payments of principal on our outstanding debt 
the principal payments consist of the payment of million on february  for the maturity of the remaining convertible subordinated notes and the monthly amortization of the new million term loan from wells fargo 
the covenants of the credit facility restrict the amount of our capital expenditures to million in and million per year thereafter 
the company did not meet the million limitation on capital expenditures in  however  wells fargo granted a waiver of the covenant 
the credit facility also requires that our operations have minimum ebitda results on a quarterly and annual basis 
on march   the company and wells fargo reached an agreement to modify the ebitda covenant calculation to exclude from the calculation the amount of the george abi zeid settlement charges of million 
failure to comply with these minimum requirements could result in the acceleration of the payment of the term loan as well as any future revolving credit advances made under the agreement 
the credit facility also restricts the incurrence of indebtedness 
the company currently expects to be in compliance with its covenant requirements  as revised  during the year ending december  for each of the years ended december   and  we received a report from our independent auditors containing an explanatory paragraph stating that we have a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plans in regard to this matter are described in note b 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
if the company s cash flow is not sufficient  we may need additional financing to meet our debt service and other cash requirements 
however  if we are unable to raise additional financing  restructure or settle additional outstanding debt or generate sufficient cash flow  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
management believes the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required  and to maintain profitable operations 
throughout  and  management improved the company s operations through cost reductions resulting in net cash from operations of million  million and million  respectively  for those years 
during those years  the company reduced its working capital deficit to million at year end  to million at year end and to  at year end during  the company reduced its debt by million 
in december   the company refinanced its remaining secured debt through a new credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc management is continuing the process of further reducing telecommunications and network related operating costs while increasing its sales and marketing efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments at december  payments due by period in thousands less than after total one year years years years long term debt obligations     operating lease obligations      purchase obligations mostly consisting of telecommunication contract commitments   other long term liabilities we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial position  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic method of accounting  and requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective for public companies beginning with the first interim period that begins after june  the company will adopt sfas r in and in accordance with its provisions will recognize compensation expense for all share based payments and employee stock options based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the statement on its financial statements 
see note p for the proforma effect of sfas in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 
the american jobs creation act of introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp fas gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations  and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
as such  the company is not in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us based on its analysis to date 
the company expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment by december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and credit risk 
the company maintains continuing operations in europe mostly in the united kingdom and  to a lesser extent  in singapore  malaysia and india 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future rate fluctuations cannot be predicted adequately 
to date the company has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
market risk our accounts receivable are subject  in the normal course of business  to collection risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks 
as a result we do not anticipate any material losses in this area 
interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates 
investments that are classified as cash and cash and equivalents have original maturities of three months or less 
changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of these investments
