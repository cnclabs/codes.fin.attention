item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that address serious diseases treated by physician specialists and in hospital settings 
in november  we acquired the rights to market and sell vancocin pulvules  the oral capsule formulation of vancocin vancomycin hydrochloride  in the united states and its territories 
we are focusing our current product development activities on product candidates to treat viral diseases  including those caused by cytomegalovirus cmv and hepatitis c virus hcv infections 
we have a significant level of indebtedness outstanding  which  as of march   consists of million principal amount of senior convertible notes due october and million of convertible subordinated notes due march in addition  the holders of our senior convertible notes have the option to purchase an additional million of the senior convertible notes on identical terms in april we have not been profitable from product sales since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million at december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  write off of acquired technology rights  general and administrative expenses  interest payments on our outstanding debt and sales and marketing expenses 
we have financed our operations since inception in december primarily from equity and debt financing  funding pursuant to collaborative and partnering agreements and more recently  revenues from sales of vancocin 
we expect to incur additional net losses over the next several years and will require additional financing by when our convertible subordinated notes mature 
strategic direction in january  we redefined our strategic direction to focus on development of later stage opportunities  to build specific franchises relating to our current development programs and to expand our product portfolio through the acquisition of complementary clinical development stage or commercial product opportunities as a means to accelerate our path toward becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company 
we intend to initially build two franchises 
we are focusing on transplant and hospital settings and hepatologists and gastroenterologists  using vancocin and our two core clinical programs in cmv infections related to hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplantation  and hcv infection  as foundations for that effort 
to expand further our product portfolio  we plan to seek additional products for diseases treated by our target audience of physician specialists and in hospital settings to complement the markets that we hope our cmv and hcv programs will serve 
to build these franchises we intend to focus on the development of our two current core clinical programs  market vancocin  and expand our product portfolio 
key events acquisition of vancocin pulvules our first significant step toward becoming a company focused on product development and commercialization by establishing franchises within narrowly focused prescribing groups was our acquisition of vancocin 
in november  we acquired all rights in the united states and its territories to manufacture  market and sell vancocin pulvules  the oral capsule formulation of vancocin vancomycin hydrochloride  as well as rights to certain related vancomycin products  from lilly 
oral vancocin is a potent antibiotic approved 
table of contents by the fda to treat antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile and enterocolitis caused by staphylococcus aureus including methicillin resistant strains 
lilly will retain its rights to vancomycin outside of the united states and its territories 
we paid lilly an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  we will pay lilly royalties on annual net sales of vancocin as set forth below royalty on net sales between million royalty on net sales between million royalty on net sales between million through royalty on net sales between million no royalties are due to lilly on net sales or net sales below or above the net sales levels reflected in the above table 
in the event we develop any product line extensions  revive discontinued vancomycin product lines injectable or oral solutions  make improvements of existing products  or expand the label to cover new indications  lilly would receive an additional royalty on net sales on these additional products for a predetermined time period 
in connection with the acquisition  we and lilly entered into a supply agreement and a transition services agreement 
the process of qualifying a third party supply chain will be ongoing during the term of the supply agreement 
the transition period ended in january when we assumed responsibility for product inventory  sales  marketing and distribution of the vancocin pulvules brand in the united states 
acquisition liquidity impact we funded the million purchase price for the vancocin acquisition through the use of million from our cash reserves and million of gross proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
the senior notes and the warrants were automatically exchanged for senior convertible notes following stockholder approval of the issuance of the senior convertible notes on january  for more information regarding the senior convertible notes  see the liquidity and capital resources section 
we anticipate that revenues from this product will generate significant cash flows  and should allow us  over the next several years  to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs 
restructuring in january  we announced that we had restructured the company s organization to focus our resources on the advancement and development of later stage products 
as a result of this restructuring  we reduced our workforce by from december levels 
this reduction is the result of discontinuing our early stage activities  including discovery research and most internal preclinical activities  and reductions in clinical development and general and administrative personnel 
during  we included approximately million of severance and asset impairment costs related to this restructuring in our loss from continuing operations 
during the third quarter of  we sold certain of our non core assets  including compounds  assays and other intellectual property related to the development of antiviral drugs targeting the smallpox virus and viral hemorrhagic fever viruses  to siga technologies  inc siga  a company that focuses on the development of products for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases  with an emphasis on products for biological warfare defense 
as consideration for such assets  siga paid us million in cash and issued million shares of siga common stock to us 
we recognized a net gain of million on the date of the transaction  which was net of broker fees 

table of contents pleconaril schering plough corporation in november  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough under which schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril in the united states and canada 
schering plough paid us an initial license fee of million in december and purchased our inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional million in january we are also eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted regulatory and commercial events  as well as royalties on schering plough s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territories 
schering plough paid us an upfront option fee of million in november in august  schering plough exercised its option to enter into a full license agreement with us following its assessment of the product s performance in characterization studies 
other than transitioning the technology to schering plough  we will have no further continuing operational involvement with the development and commercialization of the intranasal formulation of pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold 
sanofi synthelabo now sanofi aventis has exclusive rights to market and sell pleconaril in countries other than the united states and canada 
strategic risks and uncertainties we may not be successful in implementing our strategic direction 
there are a variety of risks and uncertainties that we face in executing this strategy 
in implementing our strategic objectives  we expect to have sufficient cash available at the beginning of to fund our current business operations and debt service requirements until when our subordinated convertible notes mature 
however  the results of our business development efforts could cause our actual results to significantly deviate from this estimate 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this annual report 
we may not have sufficient resources to execute our plans  and our actual expenses over the period described in this report may vary depending on a variety of factors  including the actual amount of cash flows generated from sales of vancocin  and whether such sales will be sufficient to substantially fund all of our ongoing development and other operating costs over the next several years  our ability to continue to focus on business development opportunities in order to accelerate our path toward becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company by generating revenues  and achieve profitability  sooner  our ability to continue to build franchises in narrowly focused prescribing groups in transplant and hospital settings such as hepatologists and gastroenterologists through the acquisition of additional products  the timing of anticipated events in our cmv and hcv programs  the results of our product development efforts  including results from clinical trials  variations from our estimate of future direct and indirect expenses for  our ability to raise additional financing and our ability to service or otherwise manage our debt obligations  and our ability to terminate our lease or  if necessary  sublease all unused office and lab space at the rates and or timeframes that we have estimated  or at all 
our actual results could differ materially from those results expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
the commercial sale of approved pharmaceutical products  and conducting clinical trials for investigational pharmaceutical products  are subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future vancocin sales will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  or will be sufficient to fund all of our 
table of contents ongoing development and operational costs over the next several years  that planned clinical trials can be initiated  or that planned or ongoing clinical trials can be successfully concluded or concluded in accordance with our anticipated schedule and costs 
also  we will face intense competition in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting business development activities 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 
our outstanding indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing and we may not be able to service our debt obligations 
results of operations years ended december  and overview for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of million as a result of commencing sales of vancocin in november and payments from our agreement with schering plough related to intranasal pleconaril 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  net loss per share for the year ended december  was per share  basic and diluted  compared to net loss of per share  basic and diluted  for the year ended december  the net loss includes million of costs incurred as the result of the january restructuring 
the decrease in net loss of million from the year ended december  to the same period in was due primarily to million of net sales of vancocin which commenced in november  million in revenue recognized in the year ended december  from the schering plough agreements  reduction in headcount and operational costs resulting from our restructuring during january  and a million gain on the sale of non core assets in the year ended december  the net loss in included the write off of million for the acquired technology rights for maribavir which was offset by a million gain  after the write off of related debt issue costs  from our reduction of million in principal amount of our outstanding subordinated convertible notes 
revenues revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and consisted of the following for the year ended december in thousands net product sales license fees and milestones revenues grant and other revenues total revenues 
table of contents revenue vancocin product sales for the year ended december   we recognized net sales of vancocin of approximately million  which represents net sales from november  when we acquired the rights to vancocin from lilly 
during this time period  vancocin was sold under our transition services agreement to lilly  who was our only customer 
following the termination of our transition agreement  which occurred in january  we are selling directly to wholesalers 
revenue license fee and milestone revenue for the year ended december   we recognized million of license fee and milestone payments comprised of million from schering plough pursuant to the terms of our license agreement for intranasal pleconaril and approximately million from amortization of payments received under our agreements with schering plough 
also in the year ended december   we recognized million from wyeth under our collaboration agreement 
during the year ended december   we recognized license fee and milestone revenue from advance payments received under our collaborations with wyeth and schering plough that totaled million and million  respectively 
revenue grant and other revenue for the year ended december   we recognized grant and other revenue of approximately million  which increased by million from the million we recognized for the same period in during  we received million for amounts agreed to be paid under our agreement with schering plough that had no comparable payments in and received million less in grant payments in as compared to as the result of our january restructuring 
cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales for the year ended december  was million as compared with no cost of sales in the year ended december  as we acquired vancocin in november vancocin cost of sales include the cost of materials and distribution costs 
we did not owe lilly any royalty payments on net sales during  however  our costs of sales during future periods may include royalties owed to lilly on net sales of vancocin between the dollar amounts established under our agreement with lilly 
our gross margin net product sales less cost of sales as a percent of net product sales for vancocin during was 
we entered into a supply agreement with lilly for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api of vancocin as well as the vancocin finished product for an agreed upon time period 
the process of qualifying a third party supply chain will be ongoing during the term of the supply agreement with lilly 
upon completion of the preparation of these third party manufacturing facilities and the receipt of required regulatory approvals  lilly will cease supplying us with vancocin and we will purchase api directly from third parties 
we anticipate that our gross margins will improve upon completion of the transition to the third party supply chain 
the cost to manufacture vancocin can vary materially with production volume 
to the extent that production levels increase or decrease in the future  we anticipate that the unit cost to manufacture vancocin may decrease or increase  respectively 
as a result  we would expect the cost of product sales of vancocin  and accordingly  gross profit percentage  to fluctuate from year to year 
during  we incurred product distribution expenses from lilly pursuant to the terms of our transition services agreement 
in january  our transition services agreement with lilly ended and we engaged a third party to manage our warehousing and inventory program and to handle fulfillment of customer orders 
we anticipate that our product distribution expenses will be lower in future periods  as a percentage of sales  as a result of the transition from lilly to the third party 

table of contents research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  and other overhead costs 
research and development expenses decreased approximately million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of our reduction in headcount and operational costs resulting from our restructuring announced in january our research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the year ended december  in thousands direct core programs cmv hcv direct non core programs common cold cema indirect development discovery research total direct core programs in the year ended december   we incurred million in direct expenses related to our cmv program 
during the year ended december   we initiated two phase clinical trials with maribavir to evaluate the potential for drug interactions and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of maribavir in subjects with renal impairment  respectively  and we initiated one phase clinical study involving cmv seropositive subjects who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
we had no material expenses under this program in the year ended december   as we did not acquire the rights for its development and commercialization until august during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct costs related to development activities of our hcv program  which increased million from the year ended december  these costs are net of payments from wyeth made in accordance with our cost sharing arrangement 
during  the primary drivers of these costs were phase clinical trials for our former lead product candidate and predevelopment activities  including the preparation of an ind submission  on a follow on compound to our lead product candidate 
during the year ended december   the primary drivers of million in costs were phase clinical trials for a previous lead product candidate and predevelopment activities on backup compounds  and were nearly offset by a million credit related to the amendment of our agreement with wyeth 
direct non core programs in the year ended december   we incurred million in direct costs related to our common cold program compared to million in direct costs during the year ended december  in the year ended december   all non core program direct expenses were related to the intranasal formulation of 
table of contents pleconaril  our only active product candidate in our non core programs 
the gross costs of million for the year ended december  were netted by a million credit from a revision of the estimated costs accrued for clinical development related to the oral formulation of pleconaril and a million credit related to the settlement of a disputed receivable with a former development partner that was written off in a prior year 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct expenses related to clinical and regulatory activities related to our efforts to pursue the development of pleconaril for the treatment of serious and life threatening diseases caused by enteroviral infections cema 
we ceased these development activities in connection with our january restructuring and have no comparable direct costs 
indirect expenses in the year ended december   we incurred million of indirect expenses related to our development activities  which decreased million from million in the year ended december  the decrease of million was due primarily to the reduced headcount resulting from the january restructuring 
included in the costs recorded in are million in severance and transition costs from our january restructuring 
in the year ended december   we incurred million of indirect expenses related to our discovery research activities  which decreased from million in the same period of we exited our discovery research activities in january included in the indirect costs is a million charge for severance and related costs of the january restructuring

included in the expenses for the year ended december  is a million charge for lease commitments 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization was million for the year ended december  intangible amortization is the result of the vancocin product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of we had a valuation study performed by a third party  based on information provided by management  to determine the allocation of the estimated purchase price of the vancocin acquisition among the intangible assets acquired as well as their estimated amortization period 
the following table represents the allocation of costs to the assets acquired  the related intangible assets useful lives and the amortization expense included in the consolidated statement of operations in thousands assets acquired fair value of intangibles estimated life in years amortization for the twelve months ended december  starting material inventory trademarks know how customer relationships total 
table of contents on an ongoing periodic basis  we will evaluate the useful life of these intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has impaired the value of the assets or modified their estimated useful lives 
in september  we paid gsk a million license fee in connection with our agreement for the worldwide rights excluding japan to maribavir  or vp  an inhibitor of cmv 
this fee was recognized as an acquisition of technology rights and was expensed during interest and other expenses gains interest income for the year ended december  of million decreased million from interest income of million for the year ended december  this is due to lower invested balances 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million increased million compared to million in interest expense from the year ended december  due to the interest and amortization of financing costs from the issuance of the senior notes in october if the holders of the senior convertible notes voluntarily convert the senior convertible notes or if we effect an auto conversion of the senior convertible notes prior to october   then we will make an additional payment on the principal amount converted equal to three full years of interest  less any interest actually paid or provided for prior to the conversion date 
as of march   million in principal amount of the senior convertible notes have been converted and we paid million of additional interest on such conversions through march  as the result of the exchange of the senior notes to the senior convertible notes in january  we expect to have additional interest expense in due to the make whole provision of the senior convertible notes 
based upon relevant information available as of january   we have estimated the fair value of the make whole provision using a monte carlo simulation model to be million 
the make whole provision will be adjusted quarterly for changes in fair value during the first three years that any such senior convertible notes are outstanding  with the corresponding charge or credit to other expense or income 
years ended december  and the net loss increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  net loss per share for the year ended december  was per share compared to a net loss of per share for the same period in the loss from continuing operations increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  loss per share from continuing operations for the year ended december  was per share compared to a loss per share from continuing operations of per share for the same period in during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of million  net of the write off of million in deferred financing costs  related to the reduction of million in principal of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of million  net of the write off of million in deferred financing costs  related to the reduction of million in principal of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
revenues from continuing operations were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million during the same period in during the year ended december   we recognized license fee and milestone revenue from advance payments received under our collaborations with wyeth and schering that totaled million and million  respectively 
during the same period in  license fee and milestone revenue included an accelerated recognition of million of revenue 
table of contents as a result of the termination of the co promotion and co development agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc in august  million in deferred revenue from the advance payment from aventis recognized prior to the termination of co promotion and co development agreement  and million from amortization of advance payments received under our collaboration with wyeth 
research and development expenses decreased approximately million to million during the year ended from million during the same period in this reduction in research and development expenses included a million reduction in development and manufacturing expenses related to pleconaril  a million reduction in development expenses related to our respiratory syncytial virus rsv program which we discontinued in january  a million reduction in research and development expenses related to our collaboration with wyeth  a million credit resulting from of our june amendment to the collaboration agreement  a million reduction in research and development compensation expenses  a million reduction in severance costs related to the august restructuring  and a million reduction in employee related and other research and development expenses 
offsetting these expense reductions was a million increase in research and development facility costs 
during the year ended december   our primary research and development activities included preparing for the initiation of phase clinical trials in our cmv and hepatitis c programs  activities related to exploring the feasibility of pursing the development of pleconaril for the treatment of serious and life threatening diseases caused by enterovirus infections  activities related to developing an intranasal formulation of pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold  and discovery research 
in comparison  during our primary research and development activities related to manufacturing and development of pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold  pre clinical activities in hcv being performed at wyeth  the preparation of an ind for an hcv product candidate  conducting one phase study for the treatment of rsv disease  and discovery research 
in september  we paid gsk a million license fee in connection with our agreement for the worldwide rights excluding japan to maribavir  or vp  an inhibitor of cmv 
this fee was recognized as an acquisition of technology rights and was expensed during during the year ended december   we had no marketing expenses 
during the same period in  we incurred million in marketing expenses related to pleconaril as a result of our joint marketing efforts with aventis pharmaceuticals inc this reduction was due to the termination of the collaboration with aventis in august of the marketing costs incurred during  million related to a restructuring severance charge  and the remaining million represented pleconaril marketing costs 
general and administrative expenses for of approximately million increased million when compared to million from the same period in the increase was primarily due to a non cash charge of million for a lease associated with our unused office space  and million in expenses related to business development efforts undertaken during these additional costs were offset by a million reduction in general and administrative compensation expenses  a million reduction in severance costs related to the august restructuring  and a reduction in other general and administrative expenses 

table of contents interest expense for decreased to million from million in the same period in the prior year due to the reduction of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in and the fourth quarter of interest income fell approximately million to million during when compared to the same period in primarily due to lower invested balances and lower effective yields on investments due to the relatively lower interest rate environment during versus we discontinued our sales force operations in the third quarter of as a result of the sale of our sales force to aventis 
our income from discontinued sales operations for was million 
this included a million gain on sale of the sales force to aventis  detailing fee revenue of million  million in costs related to both the severance of personnel and the termination of operational commitments related to the sales force and million in sales operations costs 
there were no sales force operations during liquidity we expect that our near term sources of revenue will arise from vancocin product sales  milestone and license fee payments that we may receive from wyeth and schering plough if agreed upon events under our agreements with each of these companies are achieved  as well as from the sale of various non core assets and programs 
however  there are no assurances that sales of vancocin will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  that the events that require payments to us under the wyeth and schering plough arrangements are achieved  or that we can sell any additional non core assets and programs 
overall cash flows during the year ended december   we used million of cash in operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  primarily from the use of million to purchase the assets related to vancocin and the funding of a restricted investment related to the interest payments on our senior notes of million 
these uses of cash were offset by million provided by net maturities of short term and restricted investments  million provided by the sale of non core assets and million provided by net fixed asset sales 
for the year ended december   we have received million of cash from financing activities  primarily related to the million provided by the issuance of our senior notes and million of cash received from employees exercising stock options and partially offset by the million of issuance costs related to the senior notes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in addition  we had million in restricted cash  of which million became unrestricted in january also  at december   the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our short term investments was 
operating cash inflows we began to receive cash inflows from the sale of vancocin in january for the year ended december   which includes the period in which vancocin was owned by eli lilly company  vancocin had unaudited net sales of approximately million 
however  there is no assurance that future sales of vancocin will meet historical product sales 
in addition  we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our product candidates currently under development 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including the achievement of milestones and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by efforts of our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  when and if approved  or they may not successfully market these products 

table of contents operating cash outflows the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and business development efforts  general and administrative expenses  and servicing our debt 
bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because our product candidates are currently in the clinical stage of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
nonetheless  we expect to spend between million and million in in our drug development efforts and the most significant uses of our near term operating development cash outflows are as described below 
for each of our development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  and other overhead costs 
direct expenses core development programs cmv program from the date we in licensed maribavir through december   we incurred million of direct costs in connection with this program  including the acquisition fee of million paid to gsk for the rights to maribavir 
during  we expect maribavir related activities to include completion of the phase study that we initiated during july  as well as the initiation of several phase clinical pharmacology studies to support subsequent phase development 
depending on the outcome of the phase study  additional clinical development activities may be pursued 
the results of this phase study will significantly impact the timing and the amount of expenses  including potential milestone payments to gsk  that we will incur related to this program in future periods 
in addition  discussions with the fda regarding these future studies may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 
we are solely responsible for the cost of developing our cmv product candidate 
should we achieve certain product development events  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to gsk  the licensor of maribavir 
hcv program from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for compounds in this program that are currently active through december   we incurred million in direct expenses for the predevelopment and development activities relating to such compounds 
these costs are net of contractual cost sharing arrangements between wyeth and us 
wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 
during the planned activities include activities to conduct phase clinical trials with hcv our hcv product candidate 
the results of the planned studies  along with other predevelopment activities performed during the year  will significantly impact the timing and amount of expenses we will incur related to this program in future periods 
in addition  discussions with the fda regarding these future studies may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 
should we achieve certain product development events  wyeth is required to pay us certain cash milestones and to purchase  in cash  our common stock pursuant to terms of our collaboration agreement 
based on the activities planned by wyeth and us  there is the potential to achieve one of these milestones in however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving this milestone during this timeframe  or at all 

table of contents direct expenses non core development programs active common cold from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for the intranasal formulation of pleconaril through december   we incurred million in direct expenses 
we will not incur any additional direct expenses in connection with this program as schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
in november  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough under which schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
schering plough paid us an initial license fee of million in december and purchased our existing inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional million in january we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted regulatory and commercial events  as well as royalties on schering plough s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territories 
indirect development and discovery expenses during  we incurred restructuring costs of approximately million that were related to our development and former discovery operations 
our indirect development expenses during totaled million 
in addition  we spent million on our former discovery operations during we do not expect to incur additional material costs related to our former discovery operations in business development activities through december   we paid an acquisition price of million and incurred million of fees and expenses in connection with the vancocin acquisition and an acquisition fee of million paid to gsk in for the rights to maribavir vp 
in addition  the costs associated with acquiring any additional product or product candidate can vary substantially based upon market size of the product  the commercial effort required for the product  the product s current stage of development  and actual and potential generic and non generic competition for the product  among other factors 
due to the variability of the cost of acquiring a product candidate  it is not feasible to predict what our actual acquisition costs would be  if any  however  the costs could be substantial 
marketing  general and administrative activities during the year ended december   we incurred restructuring costs of approximately million that are related to our general and administrative activities  of which million related to non cash transactions 
we do not anticipate incurring restructuring charges during we expect to spend between million and million in cash on marketing  general and administrative activities in this assumes no additional costs related to unused office and research and development space

as of december   we leased an aggregate of  square feet in two facilities located in exton  pennsylvania for our corporate and development activities under operating leases expiring in and  respectively 
included in the table above is million related to these leases 
during february  we reached a tentative agreement with our landlord to exit the lease that expires in we recorded a million charge during related to this transaction  which is an estimate of the payment we will make to the landlord to exit the lease  which we expect to occur in the second quarter of included in the table above is the total current obligation of million under this lease

capital resources we expect the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available at december   together with our expected cash flows from vancocin sales  will be sufficient to fund our development  operating and debt service costs over the next several years 
however  we believe we will require additional capital by march when our convertible subordinated notes mature 
to obtain this financing  we intend to access the public or private equity or debt markets or enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue equity or debt securities 
our outstanding indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing 
equity financing if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
additional equity financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our outstanding indebtedness  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce patent claims and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
additionally  wyeth is required to purchase our common stock at the time of successful completion of certain product development events pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement 
however  in the event we are not able to successfully achieve the product development events  this additional financing would not be available to us

at any time following the effectiveness of a registration statement related to the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the senior convertible notes  we may elect to automatically convert in any calendar quarter up to twenty five percent of the principal amount of the senior convertible notes into shares of our common stock if the daily volume weighted average price of our stock exceeds per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events  for trading days during any trading day period  ending within days of the notice of automatic conversion

we also agreed that we would not issue any common stock  or securities convertible into common stock  at a price below per share during such period 
the forgoing restrictions may expire sooner under certain circumstances  and are subject to certain exclusions as set forth in the indentures 
subordinated convertible notes through december  we have reduced the principal amount of our existing subordinated convertible notes by million and the outstanding balance of our subordinated convertible notes at december  is million 
we have purchased an aggregate of million in principal amount of our subordinated 
table of contents convertible notes for approximately million in cash through december  in october and november  we entered into agreements with a third party under which we issued a total of  shares of our common stock in exchange for the surrender of million of face amount of our subordinated convertible notes held by such third party 
we are currently exploring alternatives to either reduce the outstanding principal amount or to restructure our subordinated convertible notes 
even if we are successful in such efforts  our outstanding indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing 
in september  our board authorized the notes repurchase committee of the board to approve the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock in exchange for the surrender of the subordinated convertible notes from time to time 
our ability to issue these shares in exchange for the subordinated convertible notes is subject to the limitations described above under the heading senior convertible notes 
there can be no assurance that we will purchase or otherwise acquire any of the subordinated convertible notes at prices favorable to us or at all 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows revenue recognition our revenue includes both product sales from vancocin and upfront fees and milestone payments from collaborative agreements 
we recognize our revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has passed  and collection is reasonably assured 
during the transition period with lilly  all our product sales of vancocin were to lilly who then sold primarily to wholesalers 
the transition period ended in january  and we now sell directly to wholesalers 
product demand from wholesalers during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for the product in that period 
as a result  we may periodically evaluate the distributors inventory positions 
if we believe these levels are too high based on prescription demand  we may either not accept purchase orders from or ship additional product to the distributor until these levels are reduced or defer recognition of revenue if we determine there is excess channel inventory for the product 
during  we did not defer any product sales 
in addition  we established provisions for sales discounts and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns  and exchanges for expired product at the time such revenue is recognized based on historical data for the product acquired from lilly 
in addition to product sales  we have collaborative agreements with several partners and can receive upfront and milestone payments from them 
upon receipt of payment or achievement of the related milestone  we evaluate the expected payment under the four criteria listed above 
when non refundable upfront fees are deferred  they are recognized as revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but the actual performance period may vary 
we adjust the performance periods based on available facts and circumstances 
contract milestone payments related to the achievement of substantive steps or 
table of contents regulatory events in the development process are recognized as revenues upon the completion of the milestone event or requirement 
intangible assets we have in the past acquired products that have commercial sales and products that are in development phase and are unapproved to be sold commercially 
when we purchase products that have reached technological feasibility  we classify the purchase price  including expenses and assumed liabilities  as intangible assets 
the purchase price may be allocated to product rights  trademarks  patents  and other intangibles based on the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful life of the assets by considering remaining patent life  if any  competition by products prescribed for the same indication  the likelihood and estimated future entry of non generic and generic competition with the same or similar indication and other related factors 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life are often uncertain and are reviewed on a periodic basis or when events occur that warrant review 
when we purchase the rights to products that have not reached technological feasibility  ie are in the development  we expense those costs in the period in which we acquire such rights 
long lived assets we review our fixed and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows in determining whether an impairment exists and in measuring the current fair value of the asset 
stock based employee compensation we apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb in accounting for all stock based employee compensation 
we have elected to adopt only the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

restructuring charges to the extent we have activities related to exit or disposal activities  we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
in determining the costs related to these activities  there is a significant amount of subjectivity and judgment applied by management 
in addition  their impact on our financial condition could be material 
generally  we recognize and measure the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity at their fair value in the period in which it can be reasonably estimated 
these costs include employee termination benefits  contract termination costs including operating leases and other associated costs 
as of december   we leased an aggregate of  square feet in two facilities located in exton  pennsylvania for our corporate and development activities under operating leases expiring in and  respectively 
during february  we reached a tentative agreement with our landlord to exit the lease that expires in we recorded a million charge during related to this transaction  which is an estimate of the payment we will make to the landlord to exit the lease  which we expect to occur in the second quarter of the facility we are exiting represents  square feet of space to which the lease expires in after the termination date  we will have  square feet in one facility under an operating lease that expires in as of december   we had a million liability on our consolidated balance sheet related to the remaining leases payments through the termination date and the lease termination costs 
during  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in our marketing  general and administrative expenses relating to  square feet of leased space in the facility leased through this charge was an estimate of the then present value of the loss we might incur over the 
table of contents remaining years of the related lease and was net of assumed sublease income estimated at that time 
during  we moved to this facility and reversed the remaining accrual 
as a result of this move  we no longer occupied the  square feet in the building with a lease expiring in and established a new provision based upon the new space requirements  which represented the value of the lease payments  net of expected future rental income 
as our business evolves  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments

this statement replaces sfas and supercedes apb this statement establishes standards for the accounting for which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost shall be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period vesting period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
we must adopt sfas r beginning no later than july  we are currently evaluating various implementation standards of sfas r  including adoption methods and option pricing methodology
