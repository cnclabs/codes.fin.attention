item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this form k 
general overview for the year ended december   we achieved record annual drilling success rates  levels of production  natural gas and oil revenues and our proved oil and gas reserves at the end of also reached a record level 
due to our drilling success  we produced a record bcfe in compared to bcfe in at the end of  we also reached a record estimated proved reserves level of bcfe with bcfe of net additions for the year  replacing of our production 
see business and properties natural gas and oil reserve replacement 
in  we drilled wells net  including wells in the onshore gulf coast area and wells in the barnett shale play  with a success rate of compared to a success rate of in  in which we drilled wells net  in the onshore gulf coast and barnett shale areas combined 
between january  and december   of our wells drilled were exploratory and were developmental 
in  of these wells were exploratory and were developmental 
this increase in our percentage of developmental wells reflects our increased activity in the barnett shale area  which has a relatively higher concentration of development well targets than the onshore gulf coast area 
in  our natural gas and oil revenues reached a record level at million  and our net income available to common shareholders was million  or and per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
in  our natural gas and oil revenues were million  and our net income available to common shareholders was million  or and per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
these increases in natural gas and oil revenues and net income were attributable in part to the record levels of production discussed above and to higher commodity prices 
our financial results are largely dependent on a number of factors  including commodity prices 
commodity prices are outside of our control and historically have been and are expected to remain volatile 
natural gas prices in particular have remained volatile during the last few years 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil prices  and therefore  cannot accurately predict revenues 
in  including the effects of hedging activities  our realized natural gas price was higher and our realized oil price was higher in than in because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from potential increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our hedging arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices 
we have continued to reinvest a substantial portion of our operating cash flows into funding our drilling program and increasing the amount of d seismic data available to us 
in  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately to million  as compared to million in at december   our debt to total book capitalization ratio was  an increase from the ratio at the end of this increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in the amount borrowed under our revolving credit facility  the issuance of the senior subordinated secured notes and a million net increase related to the senior subordinated notes  partially offset by increases in shareholders equity from the million of net proceeds from the public offering in february and the million preferred stock conversion to common stock in the second quarter the debt changes are described under liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
since our initial public offering  we have grown primarily through the exploration of properties within our project areas although we consider acquisitions from time to time and may in the future complete acquisitions that we find attractive 
public offering in the first quarter of  we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the offering included  newly issued shares offered by us and  shares offered by certain existing stockholders 
our net proceeds of approximately million from this offering were used to accelerate our drilling program  to retain larger interests in portions of our drilling prospects that we otherwise would sell down or for which we would seek joint partners  to fund a portion of our activities in the barnett shale area and for general corporate purposes 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders 
barnett shale area in mid  we became active in the barnett shale play located in tarrant and parker counties in northeast texas 
our activity accelerated as a result of the acquisition on february  of working interests and acreage in certain oil and gas wells located in the newark east field in denton county  texas in the barnett shale trend for million the barnett shale acquisition 
this acquisition included non operated working interests in properties ranging from to over  gross acres  or an average working interest of 
the acquisition included existing gross wells net and interests in approximately  net acres  which we expect will provide another gross drill sites five of which were drilled in  of which will target proved undeveloped reserves and five of which will be exploratory 
initially  we financed our barnett shale activities with our available cash on hand 
subsequently  we have financed a portion of our capital expenditure program for the barnett shale area with funds from the october issuance of the senior subordinated secured notes 
we are exploring a number of financing alternatives which may be used to partially fund our capital expenditure program for the barnett shale area 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms that acceptable to us  or at all 
in the barnett shale area  we drilled six gross wells net in and gross wells net in  all of which were successful 
we plan to drill gross wells net in this area in  subject to obtaining additional financing to supplement our credit facility  additional senior secured note financing available and achieving expected operating cash flows 
at the end of our net production had risen to approximately mmcfe d with gross wells on line and another gross wells in various stages of testing  completion and awaiting pipeline hookup 
at the end of february our estimated net production was mmcfe d 
in addition to our drilling activity  we have continued to expand our barnett shale acreage position  growing our net leasehold acreage from approximately  to  to  acres  at the end of  and february  respectively 
similarly  we have increased our estimated number of developmental locations from four to to horizontal locations  at the end of  and february  respectively and we have increased our estimated number of exploratory drilling locations horizontal in the barnett shale area from to to locations  at the end of  and february  respectively 
pinnacle gas resources  inc during the second quarter of  we acquired interests in natural gas and oil leases in wyoming and montana in areas prospective for coalbed methane and subsequently began to drill wells on those leases 
during the second quarter of  we contributed our interests in certain of these leases to a newly formed company  pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle 
in exchange for this contribution  we received of the common stock of pinnacle and options to purchase additional pinnacle common stock 
we account for our interest in pinnacle using the equity method 
as a result  our contributed operations and reserves are no longer directly reflected in our financial statements 
in march  credit suisse first boston private equity entities the csfb parties contributed additional funds of million into pinnacle to fund its development program  which increased the csfb parties ownership to on a fully diluted basis assuming we and rmg each elect not to exercise our available options 
in march  pinnacle entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire additional undeveloped acreage  which would also significantly increase its development program budget in ccbm and the other pinnacle shareholders have the option to participate in the equity contribution into pinnacle needed to finance this acquisition and its development program in should we elect to maintain our proportionate ownership interest in pinnacle  we estimate that we would be required to contribute million 
if ccbm opts not to participate  its fully diluted ownership in pinnacle would be reduced 
ccbm currently plans to purchase additional pinnacle capital stock valued at million in march  its share of the first installment of the equity capital needed to fund the acquisition and part of the additional development program 
there can be no assurance regarding ccbm s level of participation in future equity contributions  if any 
in addition to our interest in pinnacle  we have maintained interests in approximately  gross acres at the end of in the castle rock coalbed methane project area in montana and the oyster ridge project area in wyoming 
during  we opted to exercise our right to cancel one half of the remaining note payable to rmg  or approximately  in exchange for assigning one half of our mineral interest in the oyster ridge leases to rmg  leaving ccbm with a working interest in this project area 
see business and properties pinnacle transaction for a description of this transaction 
our discussion of future drilling and capital expenditures does not reflect operations conducted through pinnacle 
hedging our financial results are largely dependent on a number of factors  including commodity prices 
commodity prices are outside of our control and historically have been and are expected to remain volatile 
natural gas prices in particular have remained volatile during the last few years and more recently oil prices have become volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil prices  and therefore  cannot accurately predict revenues 
because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our hedging arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices

liquidity and capital resources during  we made capital expenditures in excess of our net cash flows provided by operating activities  using the proceeds generated from our public offering  as described in general overview public offering  and from our october sale of the senior subordinated secured notes the senior secured notes 
for future capital expenditures in  we expect to use cash on hand and cash generated by operating activities  draws on the credit facility and additional sales of senior secured notes to partially fund our planned drilling expenditures and fund leasehold costs and geological and geophysical costs on our exploration projects in we also continue to consider other financing alternatives to fund our capital expenditures program  including possible debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on terms that would be acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate financing  we anticipate that we may be required to limit or defer our planned natural gas and oil exploration and development program  thereby adversely affecting the recoverability and ultimate value of our natural gas and oil properties 
our liquidity position was enhanced by our receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from the completion of the public offering  the increase in availability of funds under the credit facility and the proceeds from the october sale of the senior secured notes 
our other primary sources of liquidity have included funds generated by operations  proceeds from the issuance of various securities  including our common stock  preferred stock and warrants  and borrowings  primarily under revolving credit facilities and through the issuance of senior subordinated notes 
we also recently increased our liquidity through the sale of certain oil and gas properties for million in the first quarter of cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
this increase in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to higher commodity prices and higher trade payables in the decrease in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was primarily due to a smaller increase in trade payables  partially offset by higher operating income  generally due to record production and record commodity prices realized in estimated maturities of long term debt are million in  none in  million in and the remainder in the following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by year in thousands to to total thereafter long term debt    operating leases   total contractual cash obligations     includes future accretion of discounts 
we have planned capital expenditures in of approximately to million  of which million is expected to be used for drilling activities in our project areas and the balance is expected to be used to fund d seismic surveys  land acquisitions and capitalized interest and overhead costs 
we plan to drill approximately gross wells net in the onshore gulf coast area and gross wells net in our barnett shale and nine gross well net in our east texas areas in as described above  we expect to seek additional financing to fund a portion of our acquisition  exploration and development program in if we are not successful in obtaining this financing  our capital expenditures could be reduced by to million in the actual number of wells drilled and capital expended is dependent upon available financing  cash flow  availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and partner issues and other factors 
the planned capital expenditures do not include the additional contributions to pinnacle as described under general overview pinnacle gas resources  inc we have continued to reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows into increasing our d prospect portfolio  improving our d seismic interpretation technology and funding our drilling program 
oil and gas capital expenditures were million  million and including the barnett shale acquisition for  and  respectively 
our drilling efforts resulted in the successful completion of gross wells net in  gross wells net in  including six gross wells net in the barnett shale area  and gross wells net in including gross wells net in the barnett shale area 
we also expect to make an additional million equity contribution to pinnacle 
see overview pinnacle gas resources  inc since its inception  ccbm has spent million for drilling costs through the end of  of which was applied pursuant to an obligation to fund million of drilling costs on behalf of rmg 
by december   ccbm had satisfied all of its drilling obligations on behalf of rmg 
through the end of  pinnacle has reported that it has drilled gross wells since inception and estimates that of these wells have been completed 
pinnacle reportedly added approximately bcfe of net proved reserves through development drilling through december   excluding the bcfe contributed or acquired at inception 
its gross operated production has increased by approximately since its inception to approximately mmcf d at december   and its total well count stands at gross operated wells  according to pinnacle 
because of the nature of coalbed methane wells that require an extended dewatering period before significant natural gas production  pinnacle has not been able to complete its determination on commerciality of all of these wells

the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to have no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the sec released sab  which expresses the staff s views on the application of sfas no 
by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method 
sab provides interpretive responses related to computing the full cost ceiling to avoid double counting the expected future cash outlays associated with asset retirement obligations  required disclosures relating to the interaction of sfas no 
and the full cost rules  and the impact of sfas no 
on the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of the requirements of sab critical accounting policies and estimates the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the use of these estimates significantly affects natural gas and oil properties through depletion and the full cost ceiling test  as discussed in more detail below 
significant estimates include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculation depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties  future net revenues and abandonment obligations  impairment of undeveloped properties  future income taxes and related assets liabilities  bad debts  derivatives  contingencies and litigation 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production depletion and the ceiling test  have numerous inherent uncertainties 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available date and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  reserve estimates are vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
such prices have been volatile in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future 
the significant estimates are based on current assumptions that may be materially effected by changes to future economic conditions such as the markets prices received for sales of volumes of oil and natural gas  interest rates  the market value of our common stock and corresponding volatility and our ability to generate future taxable income 
future changes to these assumptions may affect these significant estimates materially in the near term 
oil and natural gas properties we account for investments in natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting 
all costs directly associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties are capitalized 
these costs include lease acquisitions  seismic surveys  and drilling and completion equipment 
we proportionally consolidate our interests in natural gas and oil properties 
we capitalized compensation costs for employees working directly on exploration activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expense maintenance and repairs as they are incurred 
we amortize natural gas and oil properties based on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
we do not amortize investments in unproved properties until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until these investments are impaired 
we periodically evaluate  on a property by property basis  unevaluated properties for impairment 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  we add the amount of impairment to the proved natural gas and oil property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and  where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
the depletion rate per mcfe for  and was  and  respectively 
we account for dispositions of natural gas and oil properties as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
we have not had any transactions that significantly alter that relationship 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the estimated present value  discounted at a interest rate  of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions the full cost ceiling 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization 
in mid march  during the year end close of our financial statements  it was determined that there was a computational error in the ceiling test calculation which overstated the tax basis used in the computation to derive our after tax present value discounted at of future net revenues from proved reserves 
we further determined that this tax basis error was also present in each of our previous ceiling test computations dating back to this error only affected our after tax computation  used in the ceiling test calculation and the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosure  and did not impact our pre tax valuation of the present value discounted at of future net revenues from proved reserves  our proved reserve volumes  our ebitda or our future cash flows from operations  our net deferred tax liability  our estimated tax basis in oil and gas properties  or our estimated tax net operating losses 
after discovering this computational error  the ceiling tests for all quarters since were recomputed and it was determined that no write down of our oil and gas assets was necessary in any of the years from to however  based upon the oil and natural gas prices in effect on march  and september   the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing and or the addition of proved reserves subsequent to those dates sufficiently increased the present value of our oil and natural gas assets and removed the necessity to record a write down in these periods 
using the prices in effect and estimated proved reserves existing on march  and september   the after tax write down would have been approximately million  and million  respectively  had we not taken into account these subsequent improvements 
these improvements at september  included estimated proved reserves attributable to our shady side well  which we have since sold in february because of the volatility of oil and gas prices  no assurance can be given that we will not experience a write down in future periods 
in connection with our year end ceiling test computation  a price sensitivity study also indicated that a percent increase in commodity prices at december  would have increased the pre tax present value of future net revenues npv by approximately million 
conversely  a percent decrease in commodity prices at december  would have reduced our npv by approximately million 
this would have caused our unamortized cost of proved oil and gas properties to exceed the cost pool ceiling  resulting in an after tax write down of approximately million 
the aforementioned price sensitivity and npv is as of december  and  accordingly  does not include any potential changes in reserves due to first quarter performance  such as commodity prices  reserve revisions and drilling results 
the full cost ceiling cushion at the end of of approximately million was based upon average realized oil and natural gas prices of per bbl and per mcf  respectively  or a volume weighted average price of per boe 
this cushion  however  would have been zero on such date at an estimated volume weighted average price of per boe 
a boe means one barrel of oil equivalent  determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one bbl of oil  condensate or natural gas liquids  which approximates the relative energy content of oil  condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to natural gas 
prices have historically been higher or substantially higher  more often for oil than natural gas on an energy equivalent basis  although there have been periods in which they have been lower or substantially lower 
under the full cost method of accounting  the depletion rate is the current period production as a percentage of the total proved reserves 
total proved reserves include both proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves 
the depletion rate is applied to the net book value and estimated future development costs to calculate the depletion expense 
we have a significant amount of proved undeveloped reserves  which are primarily oil reserves 
we had bcfe and bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves  representing and of our total proved reserves at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  a portion of these proved undeveloped reserves  or approximately bcfe and  respectively  are attributable to our camp hill properties that we acquired in see business and properties east texas area camp hill project for further discussion of the camp hill properties 
the estimated future development costs to develop our proved undeveloped reserves on our camp hill properties are relatively low  on a per mcfe basis  when compared to the estimated future development costs to develop our proved undeveloped reserves on our other oil and natural gas properties 
furthermore  the average depletable life of our camp hill properties is considerably longer  or approximately years  when compared to the depletable life of our remaining oil and natural gas properties of approximately years 
accordingly  the combination of a relatively low ratio of future development costs and a relatively long depletable life on our camp hill properties has resulted in a relatively low overall historical depletion rate and dd a expense 
this has resulted in a capitalized cost basis associated with producing properties being depleted over a longer period than the associated production and revenue stream 
it has also resulted in the build up of nondepleted capitalized costs associated with properties that have been completely depleted 
we expect our relatively low historical depletion rate to continue until the high level of nonproducing reserves to total proved reserves is reduced and the life of our proved developed reserves is extended through development drilling and or the significant addition of new proved producing reserves through acquisition or exploration 
if our level of total proved reserves  finding cost and current prices were all to remain constant  this continued build up of capitalized costs increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
we depreciate other property and equipment using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates the reserve data included in this document are estimates prepared by ryder scott company  degolyer and macnaughton  and fairchild wells  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on judgment and the interpretation of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions regarding drilling and operating expense  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the sec mandates some of these assumptions such as oil and natural gas prices and the present value discount rate 
proved reserve estimates prepared by others may be substantially higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ from actual results  reserve quantities actually recovered may be significantly different than estimated 
material revisions to reserve estimates may be made depending on the results of drilling  testing  and rates of production 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for proved properties is dependent on our estimate of proved reserves 
if these reserve estimates decline  the rate at which we record these expenses will increase 
a increase or decrease in our proved reserves would have increased or decreased our depletion expense by for the year ended december  derivative instruments and hedging activities upon entering into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative instruments as a hedge of the variability of cash flow to be received cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the derivative is effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
any ineffectiveness in the relationship between the cash flow hedge and the hedged item is recognized currently in income 
gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge are recognized in earnings as oil and natural gas revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
all of our derivative instruments at december   and were designated as cash flow hedges 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with future changes in its fair value recognized in future earnings 
we typically use fixed rate swaps and costless collars to hedge our exposure to material changes in the price of natural gas and oil 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions 
for a discussion of the impact of changes in the prices of oil and gas on our hedging transactions  see volatility of oil and natural gas prices below 
our board of directors sets all of our hedging policy  and reviews volumes  types of instruments and counterparties  on a quarterly basis 
these policies are followed by management through the execution of trades by either the president or chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president  chief financial officer and chairman of the board 
the master contracts with the authorized counterparties identify the president and chief financial officer as the only representatives authorized to execute trades 
the board of directors also reviews the status and results of hedging activities quarterly 
income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized at each year end for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  it is reduced by a valuation allowance 
however  despite our attempt to make an accurate estimate  the ultimate utilization of our deferred tax assets is highly dependent upon our actual production and the realization of taxable income in future periods 
contingencies liabilities and other contingencies are recognized upon determination of an exposure  which when analyzed indicates that it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors natural gas and oil prices are highly volatile  and lower prices will negatively affect our financial results 
we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
see critical accounting policies and estimates oil and natural gas properties and risk factors we may record ceiling limitation write downs that would reduce our shareholders equity 
total oil purchased and sold under swaps and collars during  and were  bbls   bbls and  respectively 
total natural gas purchased and sold under swaps and collars in  and were mmbtu   mmbtu and  mmbtu  respectively 
the net gains and losses realized by us under such hedging arrangements were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and are included in oil and natural gas revenues 
to mitigate some of our commodity price risk  we engage periodically in certain other limited hedging activities including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection 
we record the costs and any benefits derived from these price floors as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in natural gas and oil sales revenue  these reductions and increases were not significant for any year presented in the financial information included in this report 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december    net of tax of  remained in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the valuation of our hedging positions 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
we enter into the majority of our hedging transactions with two counterparties and have a netting agreement in place with those counterparties 
we do not obtain collateral to support the agreements but monitor the financial viability of counterparties and believe our credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
under these arrangements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed again to price risk 
we have some risk of financial loss because the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
moreover  our hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time 
our gas derivative transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
our oil derivative transactions are generally settled based on the average reporting settlement prices on the nymex for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
for the month of december  a change in the price per mcf of gas sold would have changed revenue by  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have changed revenue by  the table below summarizes our total natural gas production volumes subject to derivative transactions during and the weighted average nymex reference price for those volumes

these options were classified as derivatives 
as of december   these options have expired and a charge of  has been included in other income and expense for the year ended december  since year end  we entered into costless collar arrangements covering  mmbtu of natural gas for april through december production comprised as follows  mmbtu in the second quarter with average floor and ceiling prices of and  respectively   mmbtu in the third quarter with average floor and ceiling prices of and  respectively  and  mmbtu in the fourth quarter with average floor and ceiling prices of and  respectively

risk factors natural gas and oil drilling is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs that could adversely affect us 
our success will be largely dependent upon the success of our drilling program 
drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be discovered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control  including unexpected or adverse drilling conditions  elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs  crews and equipment 
because we identify the areas desirable for drilling from d seismic data covering large areas  we may not seek to acquire an option or lease rights until after the seismic data is analyzed or until the drilling locations are also identified  in those cases  we may not be permitted to lease  drill or produce natural gas or oil from those locations 
even if drilled  our completed wells may not produce reserves of natural gas or oil that are economically viable or that meet our earlier estimates of economically recoverable reserves 
our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular project area may decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in our production and revenues and materially harm our operations and financial condition by reducing our available cash and resources 
because of the risks and uncertainties of our business  our future performance in exploration and drilling may not be comparable to our historical performance described in this form k 
we may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule 
our final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors  including the results of our exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of the seismic data  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects  the approval of the prospects by the other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and crews  and the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
although we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects  we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame or at all 
wells that are currently part of our capital budget may be based on statistical results of drilling activities in other d project areas that we believe are geologically similar rather than on analysis of seismic or other data in the prospect area  in which case actual drilling and results are likely to vary  possibly materially  from those statistical results 
in addition  our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties 
our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating natural gas and oil reserves and their estimated value  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in this form k represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the reserve data included in or filed as an exhibit to this form k represents estimates that depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results  including historical production from the area compared with production from other areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future natural gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs  and workover and remedial costs 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially 
accordingly  reserve estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment  and actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary  possibly materially  from estimates 
additionally  there recently has been increased debate and disagreement over the classification of reserves  with particular focus on proved undeveloped reserves 
changes in interpretations as to classification standards  or disagreements with our interpretations  could cause us to write down these reserves 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped and proved nonproducing 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in our reserve reports as of december  had produced for a relatively short period of time as of that date 
because most of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure based on seismic analysis 
in addition  realization or recognition of our proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans 
lack of certainty with respect to development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 
we have from time to time chosen to delay development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the camp hill field in east texas in favor of pursuing shorter term exploration projects with higher potential rates of return  adding to our lease position in this field and further evaluating additional economic enhancements for this field s development 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this form k are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
as required by the commission  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas and oil  our actual operating costs in producing natural gas and oil  the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for natural gas and oil  increases or decreases in consumption of natural gas and oil  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 
may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 
we depend on successful exploration  development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future 
in general  the volume of production from natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future natural gas and oil production is  therefore  highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
recovery of our reserves  particularly undeveloped reserves  will require significant additional capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable  our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of natural gas and oil reserves would be impaired 
in addition  we are dependent on finding partners for our exploratory activity 
to the extent that others in the industry do not have the financial resources or choose not to participate in our exploration activities  we will be adversely affected 
natural gas and oil prices are highly volatile  and lower prices will negatively affect our financial results 
our revenue  profitability  cash flow  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of natural gas and oil 
historically  the markets for natural gas and oil prices have been volatile  and those markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
it is impossible to predict future natural gas and oil price movements with certainty 
prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  overall economic conditions  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental relations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions  the level and price of foreign imports of oil and liquefied natural gas  and the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain oil price controls 
declines in natural gas and oil prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
we face strong competition from other natural gas and oil companies 
we encounter competition from other natural gas and oil companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
our competitors include major integrated natural gas and oil companies and numerous independent natural gas and oil companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our competitors are large  well established companies that have been engaged in the natural gas and oil business much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do 
these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 
we may not be able to conduct our operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 
the natural gas and oil industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
as others use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial cost 
in addition  other natural gas and oil companies may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks 
natural gas and oil operations are subject to various federal  state and local government regulations that may change from time to time 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  plug and abandonment bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of natural gas and oil wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of natural gas and oil 
other federal  state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment apply to the development  production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of natural gas and oil  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with natural gas and oil operations 
in addition  we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs 
further  we or our affiliates hold certain mineral leases in the state of montana that require coalbed methane drilling permits  the issuance of which has been challenged in pending litigation 
we may not be able to obtain new permits in an optimal time period or at all 
we also are subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
compliance with existing  new or modified laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to various operating and other casualty risks that could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues 
the natural gas and oil business involves operating hazards such as well blowouts  mechanical failures  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  geologic formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  releases of toxic gases  and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  inclusion of other participants in drilling wells  and use of technology 
the marketability of our natural gas production depends on facilities that we typically do not own or control  which could result in a curtailment of production and revenues 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
we generally deliver natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own under interruptible or short term transportation agreements 
under the interruptible transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system  or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements 
our ability to produce and market natural gas on a commercial basis could be harmed by any significant change in the cost or availability of such markets  systems or pipelines 
our future acquisitions may yield revenues or production that varies significantly from our projections 
in acquiring producing properties  we assess the recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel  including our executive officers and other key employees  the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have entered into employment agreements with each of sp johnson iv  our president and chief executive officer  paul f 
boling  our chief financial officer  gregory e 
evans  our vice president of exploration  kendall a 
trahan  our vice president of land  and j 
bradley fisher  our vice president of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees 
our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel 
we may experience difficulty in achieving and managing future growth 
we have experienced growth in the past primarily through the expansion of our drilling program 
future growth may place strains on our resources and cause us to rely more on project partners and independent contractors  possibly negatively affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to grow will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to obtain leases or options on properties  including those for which we have d seismic data  our ability to acquire additional d seismic data  our ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects  our ability to develop existing prospects  our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  our ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of our drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  and our access to capital 
we may not be successful in upgrading our technical  operations and administrative resources or in increasing our ability to internally provide certain of the services currently provided by outside sources  and we may not be able to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
our inability to achieve or manage growth may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may continue to hedge the price risks associated with our production 
our hedge transactions may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from benefiting to the fullest extent possible from increases in prices for natural gas and oil 
because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price declines associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and thereby to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our hedging arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production  thereby providing only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices 
these arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which production is less than expected  our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of natural gas and oil or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts natural gas or oil prices 
we have substantial capital requirements that  if not met  may hinder operations 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital needs as a result of our active exploration  development and acquisition programs 
we expect that additional external financing will be required in the future to fund our growth 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  and financing under existing or new credit facilities may not be available in the future 
without additional capital resources  we may be forced to limit or defer our planned natural gas and oil exploration and development program and thereby adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our natural gas and oil properties  in turn negatively affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our credit facility contains operating restrictions and financial covenants  and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit 
over the past few years  increases in commodity prices and proved reserve amounts and the resulting increase in our estimated discounted future net revenue have allowed us to increase our available borrowing amounts 
in the future  commodity prices may decline  we may increase our borrowings or our borrowing base may be adjusted downward  thereby reducing our borrowing capacity 
our credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our producing natural gas and oil properties assets  is guaranteed by our subsidiary and contains covenants that limit additional borrowings  dividends to nonpreferred shareholders  the incurrence of liens  investments  sales or pledges of assets  changes in control  repurchases or redemptions for cash of our common or preferred stock  speculative commodity transactions and other matters 
the credit facility also requires that specified financial ratios be maintained 
we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing  particularly in view of our credit facility restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and the fact that substantially all of our assets are currently pledged to secure obligations under the credit facility 
the restrictions of our credit facility and our difficulty in obtaining additional debt financing may have adverse consequences on our operations and financial results including our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  our drilling program  purchases of new technology or other purposes may be impaired  the covenants in our credit facility that limit our ability to borrow additional funds and dispose of assets may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  because our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates  we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates  any additional financing we obtain may be on unfavorable terms  we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations  including by curtailing portions of our drilling program  selling assets  reducing our capital expenditures  refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing  and we may become more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy generally 
we may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance 
general economic conditions  natural gas and oil prices and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  affect our operations and our future performance 
our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated secured notes contain restrictive covenants similar to those under our credit facility 
in addition  under the terms of our credit facility  our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations at least semiannually based in part on prevailing natural gas and oil prices 
in the event the amount outstanding exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings 
we may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment 
if we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  we may have to sell a portion of our assets 
we may record ceiling limitation write downs that would reduce our shareholders equity 
we use the full cost method of accounting for investments in natural gas and oil properties 
accordingly  we capitalize all the direct costs of acquiring  exploring for and developing natural gas and oil properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of natural gas and oil properties may not exceed a ceiling limit that is based upon the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of the cost or the fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this charge is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities but does reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues  as further discussed in risk factors our reserve data and estimated discount future net cash flows are estimates based upon assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future 
once incurred  a write down of natural gas and oil properties is not reversible at a later date 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates for additional information on these matters 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on our annual revenues and operating income 
to mitigate some of this risk  we engage periodically in certain limited hedging activities  including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
income and losses realized by us related to these instruments were million  million  and million or  and per mmbtu for the years ended december    and  respectively 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our floating rate debt 
in regards to our credit facility  the result of a fluctuation in short term interest rates would have impacted cash flow by approximately million 
financial instruments debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowing  senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank and vendor borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
maturities of the debt are million in  million in  million in and the balance in
