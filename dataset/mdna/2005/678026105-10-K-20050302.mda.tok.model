item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in this form k 
except to the extent required by law  we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
critical accounting policies in our selection of critical accounting policies  our objective is to properly reflect our financial position and results of operations in each reporting period in a manner that will be understood by those who utilize our financial statements 
often we must use our judgment about uncertainties 
there are several critical accounting policies that we have put into practice that have an important effect on our reported financial results 
we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts to cover an expected loss 
other claims or liabilities have been estimated based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities include litigation  taxes  warranty claims  contract claims and discontinued operations 
the determination of impairment on long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators were present  the determination of the amount of impairment would be based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
our industry is highly cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income or expense in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
our valuation allowances  especially related to potential bad debts in accounts receivable and to obsolescence or market value declines of inventory  involve reviews of underlying details of these assets  known trends in the marketplace and the application of historical factors that provide us with a basis for recording these allowances 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our historical experience is materially different from future experience  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not likely be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
the selection of the useful lives of many of our assets requires the judgments of our operating personnel as to the length of these useful lives 
should our estimates be too long or short  we might eventually report a disproportionate number of losses or gains upon disposition or retirement of our long lived assets 
we believe our estimates of useful lives are appropriate 
overview we provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry through our offshore products  well site services and tubular services business segments 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
demand for our products and services by our customers is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices 
generally  our tubular services and well site services segments respond more rapidly to shorter term movements in oil and natural gas prices than our offshore products segment 
our offshore products segment provides highly engineered and technically designed products for offshore oil and gas development and production systems and facilities 
sales of our offshore products and services depend upon the development of offshore production systems  repairs and upgrades of existing drilling rigs and construction of new drilling rigs 
in this segment  we are particularly influenced by deepwater drilling and production activities  which is driven largely by our customers outlook for longer term future oil prices 
in our well site services business segment  we provide hydraulic well control services  pressure control equipment and rental tools  drilling rigs and work force accommodations  catering and logistics services 
demand for our well site services depends upon the level of worldwide drilling and workover activity 
we have also seen increased demand in our work force accommodation business as a result of oil sands development activities in northern alberta  canada 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute a broad range of casing and tubing 
sales of tubular products and services depend upon the overall level of drilling activity  the types of wells being drilled and the level of octg pricing 
historically  tubular services gross margins expand during periods of rising octg prices and contract during periods of decreasing octg prices 
we have a diversified product and service offering which has exposure throughout the oil and gas cycle 
demand for our tubular services and well site services is highly correlated to movements in the rig count in the united states 
the table below sets forth a summary of north american rig activity  as measured by baker hughes incorporated  as of and for the periods indicated 
average rig count for the year ended december  us us   us us total us us    canada total north america      canadian rig counts typically increase during the peak winter drilling season 
the average north american rig count for the year ended december  increased rigs  or  compared to the year ended december  this overall increase in activity  while tempered somewhat by lower activity levels in the us gulf of mexico did contribute to increased revenues in our well site services segment 
our well site services results for also benefited from acquisitions made in our rental tool business in the fourth quarter of and in january and april of see liquidity and capital resources on page  contributions from three newly built rigs working in west texas  which started working in december  february and december  respectively  and the impact of pricing gains in certain business lines 
the canadian rig count was flat between and  however  our operations benefited from increased activity in support of oil sands development and an international catering and facilities management contract 
offshore products results weakened compared to primarily due to decreased activity and revenues during the year  which also led to reduced cost absorption in several of the company s manufacturing facilities 
additionally  offshore products margins were lower in compared to due to a less favorable mix of higher margin connector products  and due to inefficiencies associated with various facility consolidations undertaken during however  offshore products revenues have improved sequentially in the most recent three quarters and margins improved from the beginning of backlog totaled million at december   million at september  and at december  however  project mix in our december  backlog is still not weighted towards our higher margin connector products 
we believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long lead time order cycle 
while change in backlog levels from one quarter to the next does not necessarily evidence a long term trend  we believe activity levels in our offshore products segment will increase in future quarters  given the growth in our backlog  when compared to december  on may   our tubular services segment purchased the octg distribution business of hunting energy services  lp hunting for million  including a purchase price adjustment settled in october under the terms of the transaction  we purchased hunting s us tubular inventory  assumed certain customer contracts and entered into supply and distribution relationships with hunting 
substantially all of the purchase price was assigned to the octg inventory acquired 
our tubular services segment shipped thousand tons of octg in compared to thousand tons in our tubular services segment benefited during from a year over year increase in average us land drilling activity  the acquisition of the hunting octg distribution business and a significant increase in octg prices 
tubular services margins expanded during and reached historically high levels given the significant increase in octg prices coupled with strong demand 
these benefits were partially offset by lower offshore activity in the us gulf of mexico 
during  the results generated by our canadian workforce accommodations  catering and logistics operations benefited from strengthening of the canadian currency 
the canadian dollar vs 
us dollar conversion rate averaged in compared to in the financial impact of the stronger canadian dollar was greater when comparing the first quarter to  a period of seasonal strength in canada 
movement in the canadian dollar vs 
us dollar exchange rates caused the majority of change in the cumulative translation adjustment 
the company s income tax provision for the year totaled million  or of pretax income 
our effective tax rate increased in compared to s effective tax rate of because of the effect of greater nol benefits recognized in the earlier period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that fundamental oil and gas supply and demand factors will continue to support a high level of drilling activity in north america over time which should continue to positively impact the company  particularly its well site services and tubular services businesses 
we believe that oil and gas producers have increased their view of longer term oil and gas prices based on current supply and demand fundamentals  even though they are still at levels below current prices 
as a result  our customers could increase their spending on deepwater offshore exploration and development which should benefit our offshore products segment 
however  there can be no assurance that these expectations will be realized

revenues increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to revenues of million during the year ended december  tubular services revenues and tons shipped increased million  or  and thousand tons  or  respectively  in the year ended december  compared to revenues and tons shipped in the year ended december  due to increased industry demand  higher octg prices  and contributions from the acquisition of the hunting octg distribution business which was closed in may well site services revenues increased million  or  while offshore products revenues decreased million  or  during the same period 
well site services revenues increased compared to the prior year due primarily to increased drilling activity in the united states  increased oil sands development activity in canada  an international catering and facilities management contract  favorable canadian dollar exchange rates  the impact of capital expenditures made since december  and rental tool acquisitions which were acquired for total consideration of million 
these rental tool acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of and in january and april of offshore products revenues decreased as a result of lower activity supporting offshore production facility construction given the typical lengthy time period between offshore discoveries and installation of production facilities 
gross margin 
our gross margins  which we calculate before a deduction for depreciation expense  increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  our overall gross margin as a percent of revenues was essentially flat in the current year compared to well site services gross margins increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  within our well site services segment  our shallow drilling and specialty rental tool businesses gross margins increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year three drilling rigs were added in our shallow drilling business added in december  february and december 
in addition  we realized higher utilization and footage drilling rates for all of our drilling rigs and contributions from rental tool acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of and in january and april also in well site services  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services gross margins increased by million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily because of increased camp and catering activity supporting oil sands development in canada and an international catering and facilities management contract 
our hydraulic workover gross margins decreased by million  or  as a result of decreased utilization  especially in west africa and the middle east 
our well site services gross margin percent increased slightly to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  offshore products gross margins decreased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  due to decreased activity  reduced fixed cost absorption and inefficiencies associated with various facilities consolidations undertaken during additionally  offshore products margins were lower in the current period compared to last year due to a less favorable mix of higher margin connector products 
these factors caused offshore products gross margin percent to decline from of revenues in the year to in the year tubular services gross margins increased to million  or of tubular services revenues  in the year ended december  compared to million  or of tubular services revenues  in the year ended december  as a result of increased oil and gas drilling activity which increased demand for our tubular products and services  a significant increase in octg prices during and the acquisition of the octg distribution business of hunting for million in may  including a purchase price adjustment settled in october tubular services margins expanded during and reached historically high levels given the significant increase in octg prices coupled with strong demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses sg a totaled million  or of revenues  compared to sg a of million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  sg a expense increased primarily as a result of acquisitions completed in and  higher postretirement benefit costs in the current year due to the recording of a gain upon settlement of plan liabilities in the prior year  higher professional fees and higher bonus accruals under the incentive compensation plan 
the increase in professional fees was largely attributable to costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of businesses completed since and capital expenditures made in the past year 
operating income 
our operating income represents revenues less i cost of sales  ii selling  general and administrative expenses  iii depreciation and amortization expense  and iv other operating expense income 
our operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  well site services operating income increased million during the period 
offshore products operating income decreased million while tubular services operating income increased million 
corporate and other charges increased by million in the current period 
interest expense 
interest expense was lower by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased interest expense attributable to higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions completed during the first half of and higher interest rates in was more than offset by lower debt issuance cost amortization compared to the prior period 
income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million  or of pretax income  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of pretax income  during the year ended december  see tax matters discussion following 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to revenues of million during the year ended december  well site services revenues increased million  or  and offshore products revenues increased million  or  during the same period 
well site services revenues increased compared to the prior year primarily due to increased drilling activity in canada and the united states  favorable canadian dollar exchange rates  which strengthened compared to the us dollar in compared to resulting in an increase of approximately million  and the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of canadian expenses were also impacted by exchange rate movements in compared to and offset some of these revenue gains 
offshore products revenues increased primarily as a result of greater activity supporting offshore production facility construction  primarily in the us gulf of mexico  and the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of tubular services revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this revenue increase resulted from greater quantities shipped caused by higher rig counts partially offset by lower international sales and reduced revenue per ton shipped caused by product mix oriented to shallow land drilling 
gross margin 
our gross margins  which we calculate before a deduction for depreciation expense  increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december well site services gross margins increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  within our well site services segment  shallow drilling and specialty rental tool businesses gross margins increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of rigs added to the fleet and the rental tool acquisitions completed 
also in the well site services segment  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services gross margins increased by million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  because of increased camp and catering activity in canada and an international catering and facilities management contract 
our hydraulic workover gross margins decreased by million  or  as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and a reclassification of certain field expenses  formerly classified as selling  general and administrative expenses  to operating expense 
these decreases were almost fully offset by increased gross margin from work in algeria  which commenced in late gross margin as a percent of revenues in well site services increased from in to in primarily because of more profitable accommodations operations caused by higher activity levels 
offshore products gross margins increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million during primarily due to increased revenues from shipments and work in progress 
our offshore products gross margin percentage declined by due primarily to a greater percentage of lower margin fabrication work compared to the prior period and to certain project losses incurred in our subsea pipeline operations and to reduced margins in our winch and crane businesses 
tubular services gross margins decreased to million  or of tubular services revenues in the year ended december  compared to million  or of tubular services revenues  in the year ended december  as a result of higher margin sales during  especially in the fourth quarter  and foreign sales  which occurred primarily in the first half of  and did not reoccur in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses sg a totaled million  or of revenues  compared to sg a of million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  increased sg a expense primarily resulted from acquisitions completed in the third quarter of this increase was only partially offset by lower post employment benefit costs caused by the settlement of certain plan liabilities during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of businesses completed in and capital expenditures made in and operating income 
our operating income represents revenues less i cost of sales  ii selling  general and administrative expenses and iii depreciation and amortization expense plus other operating income 
our operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million during well site services operating income increased by million  or  while offshore products operating income increased by million  or 
tubular services operating income was million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
corporate and other charges increased by million in compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  increased interest expense was attributable to higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions completed during the third quarter of  capital expenditures made during and and the write off of million  after taxes  of unamortized debt issue costs in the fourth quarter of upon the closing of a new bank credit agreement 
income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million  or of pretax income  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of pretax income  during the year ended december  decreased amounts of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income resulted in a higher annual effective tax rate for the year compared to liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  such as expanding and upgrading our manufacturing facilities and equipment  building new drilling rigs  increasing and replacing rental tool and workover assets  and our accommodation units  funding new product development and funding general working capital needs 
in addition  capital is needed to fund strategic business acquisitions 
our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our bank facilities 
cash was provided by operations during the year ended december  and in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations in was generated by our net income plus depreciation and amortization  net of working capital changes during working capital changes used million of operating cash flow in the year compared to million in the comparable period in cash was used in investing activities during the years ended december  and in the amount of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures totaled million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in both years consisted principally of purchases of assets for our well site services businesses and for consolidation of our offshore products manufacturing capacity 
acquisitions totaled million during the year ended december  during  the company completed the acquisition of several rental tool companies million  net of cash acquired 
these companies have been merged into our rental tool subsidiary  and report through the well site services segment 
in addition  we acquired the octg distribution business of hunting which required a cash outlay of million in these acquisitions resulted in increased working capital investments  particularly accounts receivable and inventory 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures with internally generated funds and proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   primarily as a result of revolving credit borrowings which were utilized to fund acquisitions 
our primary bank credit facility the credit agreement was amended  effective january   to increase our availability under the facility from million to million and extend the maturity from october  to january  the credit agreement contains customary financial covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  and our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our significant subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at a rate equal to either libor or another benchmark interest rate at our election plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
our average borrowing rate for balances outstanding during was 
we must pay a quarterly commitment fee  based on our leverage ratio  on the unused commitments under the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the credit agreement and an additional million of outstanding letters of credit  leaving million available to be drawn under the facility 
in addition  we have other floating rate bank credit facilities in the us and the us that provide for an additional aggregate borrowing capacity of million 
we had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of december  our total debt represented of our total capitalization at december  with the amended credit facility effective january   our availability has increased to approximately million as of february   which is after the funding of our acquisition of elenburg exploration company  inc for total consideration of million including cash of million on february  the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock  par value 
per share 
the board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares 
we believe that cash from operations and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
if our plans or assumptions change or are inaccurate  or we make further acquisitions  we may need to raise additional capital 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds or be able to raise such funds on favorable terms 
the following summarizes our debt and lease obligations at december  in thousands due in less due in due in due after december  total than year years years years debt and lease obligations long term debt  including capital leases   non cancelable operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      the company amended its bank credit agreement  effective january   to extend the maturity to the year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our debt obligations at december  are included in our consolidated balance sheet  which is a part of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have not entered into any material leases subsequent to december  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
tax matters our primary deferred tax asset  which totaled approximately million at december   is related to million in available federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  as of that date 
a valuation allowance of approximately million was provided against the deferred tax asset associated with our nols at december  the nols will expire in varying amounts during the years through if they are not first used to offset taxable income that we generate 
our ability to utilize a significant portion of the available nols is currently limited under section of the internal revenue code due to a change of control that occurred during a successive change in control was triggered in pursuant to section  however  it did not significantly change our nol utilization expectations 
our income tax provision for the year ended december  totaled million  or of pretax income 
the income tax provision for the year included a million income tax benefit related to the partial reversal of the valuation allowance applied against nols which were recorded as of the prior year end 
based upon positive earnings that we have generated for both financial and tax reporting purposes since our formation  we believed that we would more likely than not generate sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the benefit of all but million of the deferred tax asset associated with these net operating losses 
following the recognition of the million income tax benefit during the year  we have recognized the associated income tax benefit  on a cumulative basis  of approximately million of our million of available federal net operating loss carryforwards 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin and  in december  an amendment fin r fin entitled  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights  known as variable interest entities vies  and which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary and when it should consolidate a vie 
this new requirement for consolidation applies to entities where the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or whose equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
fin is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december  implementation of fin did not affect us 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
paragraph of accounting research bulletin arb  chapter inventory pricing  previously stated that under certain circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the implementation of sfas will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp s that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of the act that was signed into law on october  the act could affect how companies report their deferred income tax balances 
the first fsp is fsp fas fas  the second is fsp fas fas 
in fas  the fasb concludes that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from the act should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
fas gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the act on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
however  companies must provide certain disclosures if it chooses to utilize the additional time granted by the fasb 
the company is still evaluating the impact  if any  these fsp s may have on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an acceptable alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  we expect to adopt statement r on july  the company plans to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method  whereby compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
statement no r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions for stock option exercises were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we have long term debt and revolving lines of credit subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate obligations totaling approximately million for amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities 
these floating rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the floating interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  our consolidated interest expense would increase by a total of approximately million annually 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operations are conducted in various countries around the world in a number of different currencies 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency  or the functional currency of our subsidiaries  which is not necessarily the us dollar 
in order to mitigate the effects of exchange rate risks  we generally pay a portion of our expenses in local currencies and a substantial portion of our contracts provide for collections from customers in us dollars 
during  we realized foreign exchange losses of million primarily as a result of the strengthening of the uk pound versus the us dollar 
these losses are included in other operating expense income in the consolidated statements of income 
our uk subsidiary had us dollar denominated receivables and us dollar cash balances that resulted in the majority of our foreign exchange losses during
