factors considered in the evaluation process include growth of the loan portfolio  risk characteristics of the types of loans in the portfolio  geographic and large borrower concentrations  current regional economic and real estate market conditions that could affect the ability of borrowers to pay  the value of underlying collateral  and trends in loan delinquencies and charge offs 
royal bank utilizes an internal rating system to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in its loan portfolio 
all loans approved by the loan committee  executive board committee and the board of directors are initially assigned a rating of pass 
the vice president of special assets and the loan review committee are expected to recommend changes in loan ratings when facts come to their attention that warrant an upgrade or downgrade in a loan rating 
problem and potential problem assets are assigned the three lowest ratings 
such ratings coincide with the substandard  doubtful and loss classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions 
generally  an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and or the collateral pledged 
substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectable and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted 
on a regular basis  the loan review committee and senior management review the status of each loan 
while royal bank believes that it has established an adequate allowance for loan losses  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing royal bank s loan portfolio  will not request royal bancshares to materially increase its allowances for loan losses 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependant upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loss allowances could become necessary

financial condition total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at year end cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash on hand  and cash in interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts in banks  in addition to federal funds sold 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  to million at december  the average balance of cash and cash equivalents was approximately million for versus million for the majority of this average balance is held in interest bearing accounts or invested daily in overnight fed funds 
the average balance of these funds that earn interest was million in the increase in the balance of cash and cash equivalents at year end was primarily due to larger balances maintained with the federal reserve bank along with pending funding needs 
investment securities held to maturity 
held to maturity htm investment securities represents approximately of average earning assets during and are comprised of primarily government agency bonds and corporate debt securities of investment grade quality  at the time of purchase 
during  htm investment securities increased by million to million at december   from million at december  the increase was primarily due to a change with the investments committee strategy to hold government agency bonds with a maximum maturity of five years as held to maturity 
investment securities available for sale 
afs investment securities represent of average earning assets during and are primarily comprised of government secured agency bonds and government secured mortgaged backed securities  capital trust security issues of regional banks  domestic corporate debt and us denominated foreign corporate debt 
at december   afs investment securities were million as compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to maturities  calls and principal payments of existing portfolio 
loans 
royal bancshares primary earning assets are loans  representing approximately of average earning assets during the loan portfolio has historically been comprised primarily of business demand loans and commercial mortgages in roughly equal amounts  and to a significantly lesser extent  consumer loans comprised of one to four family residential and home equity loans 
during  total loans decreased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to an increased number of loans being paid in full as compared to new originations 
in the current interest rate environment  royal bank has avoided lending in transactions where its management perceived the risk reward ratio to be too high 
deposits 
royal bancshares deposits are the primary source of funding 
total deposits decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease in deposits is primarily due to allowing brokered deposits to mature and not replacing the high cost funds 
at december   brokered deposits were million as compared to million at december  certificate of deposit accounts decreased million  or from million at december  to million at december  other deposit categories comprised of demand  now  money markets and savings deposits decreased million during over their levels at december  the decrease in all savings categories is primarily due to a reduction in interest rates offered 
fhlb borrowings 
borrowings are comprised of long term borrowings advances and short term borrowings overnight borrowings  advances 
long term fhlb borrowings decreased million to million at december  from million at december  due to an advance being reclassified as a result of its remaining maturity being less than one year 
at december  short term fhlb borrowings was million 
the average balance of borrowings during was million versus million for other borrowings 
during  royal bancshares completed a private placement of preferred trust securities in the aggregate amount of million for a term of years with a call feature of years 
in addition  as result of the adoption of fin r royal bancshares consolidated into its statement of condition million of debt related to real estate equity investment of which is guaranteed by royal bancshares 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity increased million or in to million primarily due to net income of million partially offset by million in cash dividends paid in additionally  shareholders equity was affected by the decrease in market value of afs investment securities during  which resulted in an downward adjustment of million 
results of operations general 
royal bancshares results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets consist principally of loans and investment securities  while interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
net income is also affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest income as well as by non interest expenses  including salary and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other operating expenses 
net income 
net income in was million as compared to million in and million in basic earnings per share were  and for   and  respectively 
the million increase in net income for represents an increase over  and is primarily attributable to an increase in non interest income specifically with income from bank owned life insurance and gains from the disposition of other real estate owned 
the million increase in net income for represents a increase over  and is primarily attributed to the reduction of interest paid on deposits and borrowings as compared to income relating to loans and investment security portfolio  and to lesser extent  non recurring fees and accretion income 
net interest income 
net interest income is royal bancshares primary source of income 
its level is a function of the average balance of interest earning assets  the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  and the spread between the yield on assets and liabilities 
in turn  these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of royal bancshares interest earning assets and funding sources 
additionally  net interest income is affected by market and economic conditions  which influence rates on loan and deposit growth 
net interest income was million in as compared to million in the decrease in net interest income in of million was primarily due to the reduction of the yield on earning assets along with a decline in the spread of earning assets as compared to costing liabilities in the increase in of net interest income of million is primarily due to the reduction of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
interest paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased million from million in  to million in the reduction is primarily due the reduction of rates offered during loans and mortgages average loan outstandings    interest and fees on loans    average yield royal bancshares continues to originate both fixed rate and variable rate loans 
at december  variable rate loans represented of total loans 
together with some match funding of fixed rate deposits to fixed rate loans  variable rate loans have helped royal bank manage interest rate risk 
in  the average balance of loans decreased million to million primarily due a large amount of loans being paid off as interest rates remained at historically low levels 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points in primarily due to the average loan run off being at a lower yield than the average yield  along with the federal reserve increasing the short term rates in the second half of in  the average balance of loans decreased million to million primarily due a large amount of loans being paid off as interest rates remained at historically low levels 
the average yield on loans decreased basis points in primarily due to interest rates re pricing at lower levels on variable rate loans 
htm investment securities average htm investment securities    interest income    average yield htm investment securities are comprised primarily of taxable corporate debt issues and us government agencies 
the corporate debt issues are investment grade at the time of purchase 
it is royal bancshares expressed intention to hold these securities to maturity 
in  the yield on htm investment securities decreased basis points to from in this decrease was primarily due to the purchasing of low credit risk government agency bonds that are yielding to 
the government agencies at december  have step up and or call features 
in  the yield on htm investment securities decreased basis points to from in this decrease was primarily due to higher yielding investments that have maturing and being replaced with lower yielding investments as a result of current market conditions 
afs investment securities average afs investment securities    interest and dividend income    average yield afs investment securities are comprised primarily of government secured mortgage backed securities  government agencies  non rated and rated capital trust security issues of regional banks  rated domestic and us denominated foreign corporate debt securities and to a lesser extent preferred and common stock 
in  the average balance of afs investment securities decreased million to million primarily due classifying new purchases from investment runoff as held to maturity 
the basis point increase in average yield is primarily due to higher yields earned on mortgage back securities resulting from slower principal repayments speeds 
in  the average balance of afs investment securities increased million to million primarily due to the redeployment of excess cash on hand to achieve a higher rate of return than overnight funds 
the basis point decrease in average yield is primarily due to the lower yields on the new investment purchases 
interest expense on now and money market deposits average now money market deposits    interest expense    average cost of funds in the average cost of funds on now and money market deposits decreased basis points to from in primarily due to a decline in the interest rate paid on these deposits 
in the average cost of funds on now and money market deposits decreased basis points to from in primarily due to a decline in the interest rate paid on these deposits 
interest expense on time deposits average time deposits    interest expense    average cost of funds in  the average balance of time deposits decreased million to million 
this decrease in average time deposits is primarily due to the maturity of higher yielding brokered deposits that were not renewed 
in  the average balance of time deposits decreased million to million 
this decrease in average time deposits is primarily due to the maturity of higher yielding brokered deposits 
although rates in general continued to move upward in  the reaction of deposits to rate changes both increases and decreases is slower than the change in the prime rate because these time deposits must mature before a rate adjustment would become effective 
at december   of time deposits were comprised of certificates of deposits accounts with balances of  or more  while in  of time deposits were comprised of certificates of deposit accounts with balances of  or more 
these types of deposit have traditionally been considered more rate volatile than other types of deposits  however royal bank s penalty for early redemption somewhat mitigates this volatility 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for loan losses is an amount charged to expense to provide for future losses on existing loans 
in order to determine the amount of the provision for loan loss  royal bank conducts a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to evaluate overall credit quality 
this evaluation consists of an analysis of individual loans and overall risk characteristics and size of the loan  and takes into consideration current economic and market conditions  changes in non performing loans  the capability of specific borrowers to repay loan obligations as well as current collateral values 
in  a provision for loan losses was recorded at thousand  as compared to thousand in due to charges off s relating to delinquent tax liens held by crusader servicing corporation 
during senior management determined that loan loss reserve was adequate and no additional provision was required for the period 
net recoveries were thousand in as compared to net charge offs of thousand in in  a provision for loan losses was recorded at thousand  as compared to thousand in due to senior management assessment that the level of loan loss reserve was not adequate 
net charge offs were thousand in as compared to net recoveries of thousand for the allowance for possible loan loss at december  was million  or of net loans as compared to million at december  or of net loans  and million at december   or of net loans 
non interest income non interest income includes service charges on depositors accounts  safe deposit rentals and various services such as cashing checks  issuing money orders and traveler s checks  and similar activities 
in addition  other forms of non interest income is derived from changes in the cash value of boli  fees collected on the sale of residential mortgages in the secondary market and income relating to the vie s which royal bancshares has an investment 
most components of non interest income are a modest and stable source of income  with exceptions of one time gains and losses from the sale of investments securities and other real estate owned  from period to period these sources of income may vary considerably 
service charges on depositors accounts  safe deposit rentals and other fees are periodically reviewed by management to remain competitive with other local banks 
in  total non interest income increased million to million at december  this increase is primarily due income earned on the purchase of boli  income related to the consolidation of the vies and the sale of other real estate owned 
in  total non interest income increased million primarily due income earned on the purchase of bank owned life insurance boli and the sale of insurance products through an affiliation with the mony group 
non interest expense non interest expense includes compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  advertising  fdic insurance  state taxes  depreciation  and other expenses such as auditing  automatic teller machines atms  data processing  legal  outside service charges  postage  printing and other expenses relating to other real estate owned 
effective  royal bancshares through the adoption of fin r consolidates the expenses related to equity investments 
non interest expense increased million to million in  from million in salaries and employee benefits increased thousand to million in  from million in this was primarily due to annual salary increases and the addition of the royal asian bank  a division of royal bank 
occupancy expense increased thousand to million in primarily due to the addition royal asian bank 
other operating expenses increased thousand to million in as a result of consolidation of the vie non interest expense increased million during non interest expense decreased thousand to million in  from million in salaries and employee benefits increased thousand to million in  from million in this was primarily due to annual salary increases and an increase in pension cost 
occupancy expense increased thousand to million in primarily due the addition of our turnersville branch 
other operating expenses decreased thousand to million in accounting for income taxes the provision for federal income taxes was million in as compared to million for  and million for representing an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
the reduction in effective tax rate in was primarily due to the addition of boli and increased level of earnings offset by the use of tax goodwill related to the acquisition of knoblauch state bank in accounting for debt and equity securities royal bancshares accounts for investment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this standard requires investments in securities to be classified in one of three categories  held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
debt securities that royal bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
as royal bank does not engage in security trading  the balance of its debt securities and any equity securities are classified as available for sale 
net unrealized gains and losses for such securities  net of tax effect  are required to be recognized as a separate component of shareholders equity and excluded from the determination of net income 
asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this process is overseen by the asset liability committee alco which monitors and controls  among other variables  the liquidity  balance sheet structure and interest rate risk of the consolidated company within policy parameters established and outlined in the funds  cash flow and liquidity policies and procedures which are reviewed by the board of directors at least annually 
additionally  the alco committee meets periodically and reports on liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and projects financial performance in various interest rate scenarios 
liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of the financial institution to ensure that adequate funds will be available to meet its financial commitments as they become due 
in managing its liquidity position  the financial institution evaluates all sources of funds  the largest of which is deposits 
also taken into consideration is the repayment of loans 
these sources provide the financial institution with alternatives to meet its short term liquidity needs 
longer term liquidity needs may be met by issuing longer term deposits and by raising additional capital 
royal bancshares generally maintains a liquidity ratio equal to or greater than of total deposits and short term liabilities 
liquidity is specifically defined as the ratio of net cash  short term and marketable assets to net deposits and short term liabilities 
the liquidity ratio for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
management believes that royal bancshares liquidity position continues to be adequate  continues to be in excess of its peer group level and meets or exceeds the liquidity target set forth in the asset liability management policy 
management believes that due to its financial position  it will be able to raise deposits as needed to meet liquidity demands 
however  any financial institution could have unmet liquidity demands at any time 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  less than more than in thousands total year years years years fhlb advances      operating leases  standby letters of credit   time deposits      total      interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the financial institution s assets and liabilities 
these include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
the interest sensitivity report examines the positioning of the interest rate risk exposure in a changing interest rate environment 
ideally the rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be maintained in a matched position to minimize interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis is an important management tool  however  it does have some inherent shortcomings 
it is a static analysis 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given period 
the following table summarizes repricing intervals for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   and the difference or gap between them on an actual and cumulative basis for the periods indicated 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
at december   royal bancshares is in an asset sensitive positive of million  which indicates assets will reprice somewhat faster than liabilities within one year

reflects principal maturing within the specified periods for fixed and repricing for variable rate loans  includes nonperforming loans 
the method of analysis of interest rate sensitivity in the table above has a number of limitations 
certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in interest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same time periods 
the interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different times than changes in market interest rates  with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates 
also  certain assets have provisions  which limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate changes and for the entire term of the loan 
additionally  prepayments and withdrawals experienced in the event of a change in interest rates may deviate significantly from those assumed in the interest rate sensitivity table 
additionally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
capital adequacy the table shown below sets forth royal bancshares consolidated capital level and performance ratios regulatory minimum capital level leverage ratio risk based capital ratio tier total capital performance return on average assets return on average equity royal bancshares sources of capital have been derived from the issuance of stock as well as retained earnings 
while royal bancshares has not had a stock offering since  total shareholders equity has increased primarily due to steady increases in retained earnings 
at december   royal bancshares had an average equity to average asset ratio of 
royal bancshares has no current plans to raise capital through new stock offerings and indeed  seeks ways to leverage its existing capital 
the capital ratios set forth above compare favorably to the minimum required amounts of tier and total capital to risk weighted assets and the minimum tier leverage ratio  as defined by the banking regulators 
at december   royal bancshares was required to have minimum tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
in order for royal bancshares to be considered well capitalized  as defined by the banking regulators  royal bancshares must have tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
at december   royal bancshares met the criteria for a well capitalized institution  and management believes that  under current regulations  royal bancshares will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk a simulation model is used to estimate the impact of various changes  both upward and downward  in market interest rates and volumes of assets and liabilities on the net income 
this model produces an interest rate exposure report that forecast changes in the market value of portfolio equity under alternative interest rate environment 
the market value of portfolio is defined as the present value of existing assets and liabilities 
the calculated estimates of changes in the market value of portfolio value are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands market value of percent of changes in rates portfolio equity change basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  the assumptions used in evaluating the vulnerability of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates are based on management s considerations of past experience  current position and anticipated future economic conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from what the calculations may be based 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties
