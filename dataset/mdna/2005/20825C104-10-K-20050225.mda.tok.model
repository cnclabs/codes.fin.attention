the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  with phillips designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes 
because phillips was designated as the acquirer  its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger 
from the merger date forward  the operations and results of conocophillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies 
business environment and executive overview conocophillips is an international  integrated energy company 
we are the third largest integrated energy company in the united states  based on market capitalization 
we have approximately  employees worldwide  and at year end had assets of billion 
our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cop 
our business is organized into six operating segments exploration and production e p this segment primarily explores for  produces and markets crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis 
midstream this segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by conocophillips and others  and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids  primarily in the united states  canada and trinidad 
the midstream segment includes our percent equity investment in duke energy field services  llc defs  a joint venture with duke energy corporation 
refining and marketing r m this segment purchases  refines  markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products  mainly in the united states  europe and asia 
lukoil investment this segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of lukoil  an international  integrated oil and gas company headquartered in russia 
our investment was percent at december  
table of contents chemicals this segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis 
the chemicals segment consists of our percent equity investment in chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem  a joint venture with chevrontexaco corporation 
emerging businesses this segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations  including new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products eg  gas to liquids  technology solutions  power generation  and emerging technologies 
crude oil and natural gas prices  along with refining margins  play the most significant roles in our profitability 
accordingly  our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our e p and r m segments 
crude oil and natural gas prices  along with refining margins  are driven by market factors over which we have no control 
however  from a competitive perspective  there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful  including adding to our proved reserve base 
we add to our proved reserve base in three primary ways o successful exploration and development of new fields 
o acquisition of existing fields 
o applying new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields 
through a combination of all three methods listed above  we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base  and we anticipate being able to do so in the future 
in the three years ending december   our reserve replacement exceeded percent  excluding the impact of our equity investment in lukoil 
the replacement rate was primarily attributable to the merger of conoco and phillips  and extensions and discoveries 
improved recovery also positively contributed to our reserve replacement success 
although it cannot be assured  going forward  we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years  excluding the impact of our equity investment in lukoil 
this expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects 
operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely  consistently and in an environmentally sound manner 
safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations 
maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries  minimizing downtime in producing fields  and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins 
during  our worldwide refinery utilization rate was percent  compared with percent in finally  our operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship 
controlling costs and expenses 
since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell  keeping our operating and overhead costs low  within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship  is a high priority 
we monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly  on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis 
because low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries  cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs 
selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars 
we participate in capital intensive industries 
as a result  we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields  develop newly discovered fields  maintain existing fields  or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes 
we invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars 
however  there are often long lead times 
table of contents from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns 
our capital expenditures and investments in totaled billion  and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately billion in the amount excludes any discretionary expenditures that may be made to further increase our equity investment in lukoil 
excluding investments in lukoil  we project that capital expenditures will be higher than due to ongoing development projects  cost increases and new opportunities 
managing our asset portfolio 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices 
we also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed 
this management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns 
during we substantially completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the merger 
also during  we acquired a percent interest in lukoil  a major russian integrated energy company 
hiring  developing and retaining a talented workforce 
we want to attract  train  develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics 
our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow 
these include crude oil and natural gas prices and production  natural gas liquids prices  refining capacity utilization  and refinery output 
other significant factors that can and or do affect our profitability include property and leasehold impairments 
as mentioned above  we participate in capital intensive industries 
at times  these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward  when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for long periods of time  or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to fair market value 
property impairments in totaled million  compared with million in we may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which  if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful  could lead to material impairment of leasehold values 
goodwill 
as a result of mergers and acquisitions  at year end we had billion of goodwill on our balance sheet 
although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required  future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on our profitability 
tax jurisdictions 
as a global company  our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of earnings within our global operations 
segment analysis the e p segment s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices 
these are commodity products  the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control 
we benefited from favorable crude oil prices in  which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in industry crude oil prices were approximately per barrel higher in  versus  averaging per barrel for west texas intermediate 
the increase primarily was due to strong global consumption associated with the robust global economic recovery and particularly strong demand growth in china  as well as oil supply disruptions in iraq and in the us gulf of mexico due to hurricane activity  with little excess opec production capacity available to replace lost supplies 
industry us natural gas prices were moderately higher in  versus  
table of contents averaging approximately per thousand cubic feet for henry hub 
natural gas prices rose in due primarily to higher oil prices  continued concerns regarding the adequacy of us natural gas supplies  and hurricane activity disrupting production in the us gulf of mexico 
at year end  we estimated that a per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated million annual impact on net income 
for natural gas  the corresponding impact is approximately million for a cent per thousand cubic feet price change 
the midstream segment s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices 
the most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our percent equity investment in defs 
higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in during  we sold some of our non defs midstream assets located in the lower states that are not associated with our e p operations 
refining margins  refinery utilization  cost control  and marketing margins primarily drive the r m segment s results 
refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks  and the sales prices for refined products  which are subject to market factors over which we have no control 
refining margins in were improved over  resulting in improved r m profitability 
industry us refining margins were sharply higher in versus due to robust us refined product demand and concerns regarding the adequacy of refined product supplies in the us market in light of tightening gasoline specifications and the ban on methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in new york and connecticut 
industry us marketing margins declined in versus  as wholesale and retail prices did not keep pace with rising gasoline and diesel spot market prices  which rose in part as a consequence of the increase in crude oil prices 
at year end  we estimated that a cent per barrel change in worldwide refining margins would have an estimated million annual impact on net income 
for us marketing margins  the corresponding impact is approximately million for a cent per gallon margin change 
our refineries operated at percent of capacity in  and our goal in is to operate at an even higher level 
the lukoil investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of lukoil 
in october  we closed on a transaction to acquire percent of lukoil s shares held by the russian government for approximately billion 
during the remainder of the year  we acquired additional shares in the open market for an additional million  bringing our equity ownership interest in lukoil to percent by year end the chemicals segment consists of our percent interest in cpchem 
the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which cpchem has little or no control 
the chemicals and plastics industry had been in a cyclical downturn that began in late in this difficult market environment  cpchem placed great emphasis on safety  cost control and managing its capacity utilization 
in addition  cpchem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the middle east with access to large  growing markets  such as asia 
during  margins improved in the chemicals and plastics industries  leading to improved results from this segment 
the emerging businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations 
we do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results 
however  the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years 

table of contents at december   we had a debt to capital ratio of percent  compared with percent at the end of the decrease was due to a billion reduction in debt during  along with increased equity reflecting strong earnings 
if market conditions permit  we are targeting to lower our debt to capital ratio over the next several years to the low percent range 
this should improve our cost of capital and further position us for growth opportunities in the future

production and operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses due to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger  partially offset by lower merger related costs in depreciation  depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base 
taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales  production volumes and property and payroll taxes 
interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger 
in addition to the merger impact  sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil  natural gas  automotive gasoline and distillates 
a higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in during  we sold several e p operations that did not fit into our long term growth strategy 
in addition  included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses in included a million charge for the write off of in process research and development costs acquired in the merger 
the absence of such a significant charge in the period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item

international e p s production averaged  boe per day in  compared with  boe per day in in addition  our syncrude mining operations produced  barrels per day in  compared with  barrels per day in the merger was the primary reason for the production increase 
international e p s net income in also was favorably impacted by the following items in norway  the norway removal grant act was repealed in the second quarter of prior to its repeal  this act required the norwegian government to contribute to the cost of removing offshore oil and gas production facilities 
now  the co venturers in the facilities must fund all removal costs  but can deduct the removal costs  as incurred  under the petroleum tax act  at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of removal 
these changes required us to recognize an additional liability for the government s share  prior to repeal of the act  of the future removal costs  with a corresponding increase in properties  plants and equipment pp e  and to establish a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax basis of all of our norwegian removal assets and liabilities 
some of the increases in pp e were on shut in fields  which led to immediate impairments of those properties 
the overall impact on results was a net after tax benefit of million 
in the timor sea region  conocophillips and its co venturers received final approvals from authorities to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the bayu undan project in the second quarter of this approval allowed a broad ownership interest re alignment among the co venturers to proceed  which included our sale of a percent interest in the project and the issuance of equity by previously wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  the ratification of the australia timor leste treaty lowered the company s deferred tax liability position 
the net result of these events was an after tax benefit of million in see note subsidiary equity transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
in november  the canadian parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers 
as a result  we recognized a million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter

these products are then marketed and sold  or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals  such as polyethylene  polystyrene and cyclohexane 
vs 
net income from the chemicals segment increased million in  compared with the improvement reflects that cpchem had improved equity earnings from qatar chemical company ltd 
q chem  an olefins and polyolefins complex in qatar  and saudi chevron phillips company  an aromatics complex in saudi arabia 
results from cpchem s consolidated operations also improved from higher ethylene and benzene margins  as well as increased ethylene  polyethylene and normal alpha olefins sales volumes 
vs 
the worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of  and the downturn continued through the downturn led to excess production capacity in the industry and pressured margins on key products 
the chemicals industry has also been impacted by high energy prices  which negatively impacts both utility and feedstock costs

the category other consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand alone basis  including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses  and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation 
results from other were lower in  mainly due to the inclusion in the period of gains related to insurance demutualization benefits  negative foreign currency transaction impacts  higher environmental costs and increased minority interest expense 
vs 
net interest increased percent in  compared with the increase in mainly was due to our higher debt levels following the merger  the impact of the adoption of fin r for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures  and increased premiums on the early retirement of debt 
the adoption of fin r at january   increased debt  which resulted in higher interest expense

these beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of various insurance policies and contracts issued by the mutual companies

to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we look to a variety of funding sources  primarily cash generated from operating activities 
in addition  during we raised approximately billion in funds from the sale of assets 
during  available cash was used to support the company s ongoing capital expenditures and investments program  repay debt and pay dividends 
in september  our board of directors board declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share  which represented a percent increase from the previous quarter s dividend rate 
total dividends paid on our common stock in were billion 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million to  million 
in early  a portion of this cash was used to repay million of commercial paper that had been outstanding at december  in addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales  we also rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs  as well as our billion universal shelf registration statement  to support our short and long term liquidity requirements 
we anticipate that these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through  including our capital spending program and required debt payments 
our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from through in addition to favorable market conditions  major acquisitions and mergers played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities 
the most significant event during this period was the merger of conoco and phillips on august  phillips was designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes  so operating cash flows included eight months january through august of phillips activity only and four months of conocophillips activity september through december  while included the first full year of conocophillips activity 
absent any other significant acquisitions or mergers during  we expect that market conditions will be the most important factor affecting our cash flows  when compared with 
table of contents significant sources of capital operating activities during cash of  million was provided by operating activities  an increase of  million from this increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations  partially offset by an increase in working capital 
the working capital increase primarily was driven by higher accounts receivable and a higher retained interest in receivables sold to a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  partly offset by higher accounts payable 
contributing to the increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable were higher sales and purchase prices  respectively 
for additional information on income from continuing operations  see the results of operations section 
for additional information on receivables sold to a qspe  see receivables monetization in the off balance sheet arrangements section 
our cash flows from operating activities for both the short and long term are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  as well as refining and marketing margins 
during and particularly in  we benefited from high crude oil and natural gas prices  as well as strong refining margins 
the sustainability of these prices and margins are driven by market conditions over which we have no control 
in addition  the level of our production volumes of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows 
these production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields  field production decline rates  new technologies  operating efficiency  the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success  and the timely and cost effective development of those proved reserves 
we will need to continue to add to our proved reserve base through exploration and development of new fields  or by acquisition  and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved reserves 
we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and  although it cannot be assured  anticipate being able to do so in the future 
our barrel of oil equivalent boe production  after adjusting our production for approximately  boe per day for assets sold in and early  has increased in each of the past three years  and 
excluding the impact of our equity investment in lukoil on our production  we expect our production level to be approximately percent higher than our level of million boe per day 
in  we expect our production level to increase an additional percent over our projected boe production level 
beyond  we estimate our boe production to grow at an average annual rate of approximately percent for the period through these projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp up in those years and exclude our canadian syncrude mining operations 
excluding the impact of our equity investment in lukoil on our proved oil and gas reserves  our reserve replacement over the three year period ending december   exceeded percent 
contributing to our success during this three year period were proved reserves added by the merger of conoco and phillips  volumes added through extensions and discoveries  and improved recovery 
although it cannot be assured  going forward  we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years 
this expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects 
as discussed in critical accounting policies  engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise and therefore each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs 
in and  revisions decreased our reserves  while in  revisions increased reserves 
it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future 
the net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for percent  percent and percent of our total net additions in  and  respectively 

table of contents during these years  we converted  on average  approximately percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at december   we estimate that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the following three years will be in the percent range 
for additional information related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves  see the discussion under the e p section of capital spending 
the projections and actual results noted above exclude the impact of our equity investment in lukoil  and the anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to risks  including reservoir performance  operational downtime  finding and development execution  obtaining management  board and third party approval of development projects in a timely manner  regulatory changes  geographical location  market prices  and environmental issues  and therefore  cannot be assured 
asset sales following the merger  we initiated an asset disposition program 
our ultimate target was to raise approximately billion by the end of during  proceeds from asset sales were billion  bringing total proceeds to approximately billion since the program began 
while we will continue to have modest asset disposition activity  this asset disposition program was essentially completed at the end of the second quarter of proceeds from these asset sales were used primarily to pay off debt 
commercial paper and credit facilities while the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration  our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins  as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil  natural gas and petroleum product purchases 
our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is a billion commercial paper program  a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies limited to euro billion equivalent 
commercial paper maturities are generally limited to days 
at december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding  compared with million of commercial paper outstanding at december  effective october   we entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling billion to replace our previously existing billion day facility that was set to expire on october   two revolving credit facilities totaling billion expiring in october  and a million facility expiring in october the two new facilities include a billion four year facility expiring in october and a billion five year facility expiring in october both facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for our billion commercial paper program 
in addition  the five year facility may be used to support issuances of letters of credit totaling up to million 
the facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings 
the credit agreements do contain a cross default provision relating to our  or any of our consolidated subsidiaries  failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of million or more 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december  one of our norwegian subsidiaries had two million revolving credit facilities that expired in june  which were not renewed 

table of contents moody s investor service has maintained a rating of a on our senior long term debt  and standard and poors rating service and fitch have maintained ratings of a 
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity 
in the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market  we would still be able to access funds under our billion revolving credit facilities 
based on our commercial paper balance of million and having issued million of letters of credit at year end  we had access to billion in borrowing capacity as of december   which provides liquidity to cover daily operations 
in addition  at year end our billion cash balance and million of remaining capacity related to our receivables monetization program also supported our liquidity position 
shelf registration in late  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission for various types of debt and equity securities 
as a result  we have available to issue and sell a total of billion of various types of securities under the universal shelf registration statement 
minority interests at december   we had outstanding  million of equity held by minority interest owners  including a minority interest of million in ashford energy capital sa the remaining minority interest amounts related to controlled operating joint ventures with minority interest owners 
the largest of these  million  was related to the bayu undan liquefied natural gas project in the timor sea 
during the third quarter of  a million net minority interest in conoco corporate holdings lp was retired 
in december  in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes  conoco and cold spring finance sarl formed ashford energy capital sarl through the contribution of a billion conoco subsidiary promissory note and million cash by cold spring 
through its initial million investment  cold spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three month libor rates  plus percent 
the preferred return at december   was percent 
in  and at each year anniversary thereafter  cold spring may elect to remarket their investment in ashford  and if unsuccessful  could require conocophillips to provide a letter of credit in support of cold spring s investment  or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided  then cause the redemption of their investment in ashford 
should conocophillips credit rating fall below investment grade  ashford would require a letter of credit to support million of the term loans  as of december   made by ashford to other conocophillips subsidiaries 
if the letter of credit is not obtained within days  cold spring could cause ashford to sell the conocophillips subsidiary notes 
at december   ashford held billion of conocophillips subsidiary notes and million in investments unrelated to conocophillips

other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above  cold spring does not have recourse to our general credit

r m capital spending for continuing operations for r m during the three year period ending december   was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards  refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields  and the operating integrity of key processing units  as well as for safety projects 
during this three year period  r m capital spending for continuing operations was billion  representing percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations 
key projects during the three year period included construction of a polypropylene plant at the bayway refinery in new jersey 
construction of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a s zorb sulfur removal technology unit at the ferndale  washington  refinery 
expansion of the alkylation unit at the los angeles refinery 
capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the borger  texas  refinery

table of contents we plan to direct about billion of the r m capital budget to domestic refining  of which approximately percent will go toward domestic clean fuels projects in order to comply with new us environmental protection agency epa standards for refined products 
worldwide  clean fuels spending for our r m refining business is expected to be million  or approximately percent of the total refining budget 
our us marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about million  while the remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in europe and the asia pacific region 
emerging businesses capital spending for emerging businesses during the three year period ending december   was primarily for construction of the immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company s humber refinery in the united kingdom 
the plant began commercial operations in october contingencies legal and tax matters we accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
based on currently available information  we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international  federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry  and refining  marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses 
the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include  among others  the federal clean air act  which governs air emissions 
federal clean water act  which governs discharges to water bodies 
federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which imposes liability on generators  transporters  and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur 
federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  storage  and disposal of solid waste 
federal oil pollution act of opa  under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located  and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states 
federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra  which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments 

table of contents federal safe drinking water act  which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells 
us department of the interior regulations  which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in us waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations  as well as potential liability for pollution damages 
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and  in the case of discharges to water  establish water quality limits 
they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application 
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have  or are developing  similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities 
while similar  in some cases these regulations may impose additional  or more stringent  requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards  such as air emission standards  water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations  continue to evolve 
however  environmental laws and regulations  including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change  are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate 
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 
for example  the epa has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel  which become applicable in june in april  the epa proposed a rule regarding emissions from non road diesel engines and limiting non road diesel fuel sulfur content 
the non road rule  as promulgated in june  significantly reduces non road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as we are evaluating and developing capital strategies for future integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non road markets 
additional areas of potential air related impact are the proposed revisions to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs and the kyoto protocol 
in july  the epa promulgated more stringent revisions to the naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
since that time  final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation american trucking association  inc et al 
v 
united states environmental protection agency that eventually reached the us supreme court during the fall of in february  the us supreme court remanded this matter  in part  to the epa to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone naaqs 
the epa responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new hour naaqs on april  several environmental groups have since filed challenges to this new rule 
depending upon the outcomes of the various challenges  area designations  and the resulting state implementation plans  the revised naaqs could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us 
in  an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement  known as the kyoto protocol  which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations 
the united states has not ratified the treaty codifying the kyoto protocol but may in the future ratify  support or sponsor either it or other climate change related emissions reduction programs 
other countries where we have interests  or may have interests in the future  have made commitments to the kyoto protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations 

table of contents because considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately govern implementation of the kyoto protocol  it currently is not possible to accurately estimate our future compliance costs under the kyoto protocol  but they could be substantial 
the kyoto protocol became effective as to its ratifying countries in february we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations 
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents 
remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present conocophillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the united states 
federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards 
in addition to other cleanup standards  many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 
mtbe standards continue to evolve  and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of mtbe contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial 
at rcra permitted facilities  we are required to assess environmental conditions 
if conditions warrant  we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
in contrast to cercla  which is often referred to as superfund  the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us 
over the next decade  we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required  but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years 
longer term  expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
we  from time to time  receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute 
on occasion  we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us  but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations 
as of december   we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at sites around the united states 
at december   we had resolved of these sites and had received new notices of potential liability  leaving unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability 
for most superfund sites  our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us  versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties  is relatively low 
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites  other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations  and where they have not  or where potentially responsible parties could not be located  our share of liability has not increased materially 
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned 
prior to actual cleanup  those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions  apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation 
in some instances  we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability 
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval 
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant  and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures  neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites  in the aggregate  is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

table of contents expensed environmental costs were million in and are expected to be about million in and million in capitalized environmental costs were million in and are expected to be about  million and million in and  respectively 
remediation accruals we accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
these accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination  which we do record on a discounted basis 
many of these liabilities result from cercla  rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct  or once conducted  operations or at sites where conocophillips generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
if applicable  we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries 
in the future  we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs  and under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of december  remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site  depending on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties 
therefore  it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 
at december   our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to continuing operations of  million  compared with  million at december  we expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next years 
notwithstanding any of the foregoing  and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
however  we currently do not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
other we have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities  loss carryforwards  and credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized 
uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs 
based on our historical taxable income  our expectations for the future  and available tax planning strategies  management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income

emerging issues at a november meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf discussed issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  which addresses accounting issues that arise when one company both sells inventory to and buys inventory from another company in the same line of business 
this draft encompasses our buy sell transactions described in the revenue recognition section of note accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
depending on the eitf s conclusions on this issue  it is possible that we could have to decrease sales and other operating revenues for  and by  million   million and  million  respectively  with a corresponding decrease in purchased crude oil  natural gas and products on our consolidated income statement 
we believe any impact to our income from continuing operations and net income would result from lifo inventory and would not be material to our financial statements 
additionally  these transactions have no impact on reported volumes for the production of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids or refinery throughput and are not a significant component of reported volumes for sales of petroleum products 
the fasb is currently reviewing the accounting guidance provided in sfas no

in june  the fasb published the exposure draft  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
if the liability s fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  then the entity must disclose a a description of the obligation  b the fact that a liability has not been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  and c the reasons why the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated 
depending on the fasb s conclusions on this issue  it is possible that we would need to reconsider our asset retirement obligations and related disclosures for certain of our downstream assets primarily refineries 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
see note accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
these critical accounting policies are discussed with the audit and finance committee at least annually 
we believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies  along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report  address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information  prior to the discovery of proved reserves  is expensed as incurred  similar to accounting for research and development costs 
however  leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet  pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect 
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds  management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date 
for leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small  management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area 
for prospects in areas that have had limited  or no  previous exploratory drilling  the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high 
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost  and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense 
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds  and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively 
by the end of the contractual period of the leasehold  the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 
table of contents percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned  or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development 
see the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures about costs incurred and capitalized costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity  and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties 
at year end  the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs  that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation  was approximately million and the accumulated impairment reserve was approximately million 
the weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately years 
if that judgmental percentage were to be raised by percent across all calculations  the pretax leasehold impairment expense in  would increase by million 
the remaining  million of capitalized unproved property costs at year end consisted of individually significant leaseholds  mineral rights held into perpetuity by title ownership  exploratory wells currently drilling  and suspended exploratory wells  which management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects 
of this amount  approximately billion is concentrated in nine major projects  of which management expects approximately million to move to proved properties in see the following discussion of exploratory costs for more information on suspended exploratory wells 
exploratory costs for exploratory wells  drilling costs are temporarily capitalized  or suspended  on the balance sheet  pending a determination of whether a sufficient quantity of potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well 
accounting rules require this judgment to be made within one year of well completion in areas not requiring major infrastructure capital expenditures 
if a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense 
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas in areas where major infrastructure capital expenditures eg  a pipeline or offshore platform are required before production can begin  and the economic viability of those capital expenditures depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory drilling work in the area  the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory drilling work is under way or firmly planned 
in these situations  recoverable reserves are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find as a producing well  without considering the major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made 
once all additional exploratory drilling and testing work has been completed  the economic viability of the overall project  including any major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made  is evaluated within one year of the last exploratory well completion 
if economically viable  internal company approvals are obtained to move the project into the development phase 
often  the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals  the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control 
exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained 
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained  the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves 
for complex exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional drilling work on the potential oil and gas field  or we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting 
unlike leasehold acquisition costs  there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs 
management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term 

table of contents included in total suspended well costs at year end was million related to eight exploratory wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned  but for which we are actively pursuing those activities necessary to classify the reserves as proved 
these costs were suspended between and at year end  we were awaiting government approval of the development plan for the bohai bay phase ii project in china 
suspended well costs associated with this project represented million of the million total 
this project was approved by the government in early  which will allow us to book proved reserves in  at which time the suspended well costs will be reclassified as part of the capitalized costs of the project 
in addition  suspended amounts at year end also included million related to projects where infrastructure decisions are dependent on environmental permitting and production capacity  or where we are continuing to assess reserves and their potential development 
during and  additions to suspended wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned were million and million  respectively 
had these amounts been expensed  they would not have had a material impact on our trend of exploration expenses or our financial statements 
at year end and  we did not have any amounts suspended that were associated with areas not requiring major capital expenditures before production could begin  where more than one year had elapsed since the completion of drilling 
for additional information on suspended wells  see note properties  plants and equipment  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
proved oil and gas reserves and canadian syncrude reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes  the production or mining plan  historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company s exploration and production e p operations 
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved 
our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines 
we have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our e p segment 
proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation 
also  as required by authoritative guidelines  the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shutdown for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date 
this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves 
therefore  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
year end estimated reserves related to our lukoil investment segment were based on lukoil s year end oil and gas reserves 
because lukoil s accounting cycle close and preparation of us gaap financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close  our percent equity share of lukoil s oil and gas proved reserves at year end have been estimated based on the prior year report without any provision for potential reserve additions and include adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provide for estimated production 
any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period 
this estimate to actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves 

table of contents the judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset 
at year end  the net book value of productive e p properties  plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation  including our canadian syncrude bitumen oil sand assets  was approximately billion and the depreciation  depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in was approximately billion 
the estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were billion boe at the beginning of and were billion boe at the end of the estimated proved reserves on the canadian syncrude assets were million barrels at the beginning of and were million barrels at the end of if the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by percent across all calculations  pretax depreciation  depletion and amortization in would have been increased by an estimated million 
impairments of producing oil and gas properties in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
of these writedowns  only million in  million in and million in were due to downward revisions of proved reserves 
the remainder of the impairments resulted either from properties being designated as held for sale or from the repeal of the norway removal grant act that increased asset removal obligations 
impairment of assets long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
if  upon review  the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets  at an entire complex level for downstream assets  or at a site level for retail stores 
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets  the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes  prices and costs  considering all available information at the date of review 
see note property impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts  permits and regulations  we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites 
our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world  and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska 
the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset 
estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult 
most of these removal obligations are many years  or decades  in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs 
asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly  as well as political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
see note accounting policies  note asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs  and note new accounting standards and emerging issues  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 

table of contents business acquisitions purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business 
for most assets and liabilities  purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties  plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
intangible assets and goodwill in connection with the acquisition of tosco corporation on september   and the merger of conoco and phillips on august   we recorded material intangible assets for trademarks and tradenames  air emission permit credits  and permits to operate refineries 
these intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized 
this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future 
if  due to changes in facts and circumstances  management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives  amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis 
as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives  they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests  which requires management s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 
see note merger of conoco and phillips  and note property impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
also in connection with the acquisition of tosco and the merger of conoco and phillips  we recorded a material amount of goodwill 
under the accounting rules for goodwill  this intangible asset is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit 
the various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
however  two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
within our exploration and production segment and our refining and marketing segment  we determined that we have one and two reporting units  respectively  for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
these are worldwide exploration and production  worldwide refining and worldwide marketing 
our midstream  chemicals and emerging businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies operations did not overlap in these 
table of contents operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas 
in our exploration and production operating segment  management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas 
all of these geographic areas have similar business processes  distribution networks and customers  and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations 
therefore  all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit  worldwide exploration and production  which is the same as the operating segment 
in contrast  in our refining and marketing operating segment  management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas 
because the two broad functional areas of refining and marketing have dissimilar business processes and customers  we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the refining and marketing operating segment level 
instead  we identified two reporting units within the operating segment worldwide refining and worldwide marketing 
components in those two reporting units have similar business processes  distribution networks and customers 
if we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar  the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation 
in addition  the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit s goodwill  based on relative fair values  which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income  and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
in addition  if the first test step is not met  further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation 
again  management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
at year end  the estimated fair values of our worldwide exploration and production  worldwide refining  and worldwide marketing reporting units ranged from between percent to percent higher than recorded net book values including goodwill of the reporting units 
however  a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the billion of goodwill 
use of equity method accounting for investment in lukoil in october  we purchased percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of lukoil from the russian government 
during the remainder of  we purchased additional shares of lukoil on the open market and reached an ownership level of percent in lukoil by the end of on january   lukoil held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our nominee to the lukoil board of directors was elected under the cumulative voting rules in russia  and certain amendments to lukoil s charter were approved which provide protections to preserve the significant influence of major stockholders in lukoil  such as conocophillips 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the two companies began the secondment of managerial personnel between the two companies 
significant progress is also being made on advancing the major oil and gas joint venture between the two companies in the timan pechora region of northern russia  over which we expect to have joint control with lukoil 

table of contents based on the overall facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in lukoil  we concluded that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of lukoil and thus applied the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of determination of whether one company has significant influence over another  the criterion required by apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  in order to use equity method accounting  is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall facts and circumstances of each situation 
under the equity method of accounting  we estimate and record our weighted average ownership share of lukoil s net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap each period as equity earnings on our income statement  with a corresponding increase in our recorded investment in lukoil 
cash dividends received from lukoil each period reduce our recorded investment in lukoil 
the use of equity method accounting also requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of lukoil s oil and gas disclosures in our report 
if future facts and circumstances were to change to where we no longer believe we have significant influence over lukoil s operating and financial policies  we would have to change our accounting classification for the investment to an available for sale equity security under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
if that unlikely event were to occur  our investment in lukoil would be marked to market each period  based on lukoil s publicly traded share price  with the offset recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
additionally  we would no longer record our ownership share of lukoil s net income each period and any cash dividends received would be reported as dividend income when declared by lukoil 
we also would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of lukoil s oil and gas disclosures 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of equity method earnings from our percent weighted average ownership level in lukoil during the quarter and as of december   supplementally reported an estimated million barrels of crude oil and billion cubic feet of natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of percent at year end because lukoil s accounting cycle close and preparation of us gaap financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close  we have used all available information to estimate lukoil s us gaap net income for the fourth quarter of for purposes of our equity method accounting 
any differences between our estimate and the actual lukoil us gaap net income will be recorded in equity earnings 
in addition  we used all available information to estimate our share of lukoil s oil and gas disclosures 
if  instead of equity method accounting  we had been required to follow the requirements of sfas no 
for our investment in lukoil  the mark to market adjustment to reflect lukoil s publicly traded share price at year end would have been a pretax charge against other comprehensive income of approximately million 
also  million of acquisition related costs would have been expensed and million of equity earnings would not have been recorded 
at the end of  our cost of investment in lukoil shares exceeds our percent share of lukoil s historical us gaap balance sheet equity by an estimated million 
under the accounting guidelines of apb opinion no 
 the basis difference between the cost of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the historical net assets of lukoil is accounted for as if lukoil were a consolidated subsidiary 
in other words  a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed to determine how lukoil assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in a hypothetical push down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in lukoil s shares 
once these hypothetical push down adjustments have been identified  the nature of the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities determines the future amortization pattern for the basis difference 
we have up to one year after a stock purchase to finalize this hypothetical purchase price allocation  but have preliminarily decided to associate the basis difference primarily with lukoil s developed property  plant and equipment base 
the earnings we recorded for our lukoil investment in the fourth quarter of thus included a reduction 
table of contents for the amortization of this basis difference 
when finalizing this preliminary purchase price allocation in  we will use all available information to make this estimate 
inventory valuation our lifo cost inventories are sensitive to lower of cost or market impairment write downs  whenever price levels fall 
while crude oil is not the only product in the company s lifo pools  its market value is a major factor in lower of cost or market calculations 
we estimate that impairments could occur if a percent percent blended average of west texas intermediate brent crude oil prices falls below per barrel at a reporting date 
the determination of replacement cost values for the lower of cost or market test uses objective evidence  but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations 
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the required company contributions into the plans 
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events  including estimated retirement dates  salary levels at retirement  mortality rates  lump sum election rates  rates of return on plan assets  future health care cost trend rates  and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees 
due to the specialized nature of these calculations  we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations 
for employee retirement income security act qualified pension plans  the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets 
due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies  the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects 
ultimately  we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns  but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time 
benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by million  while a percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million 
outlook e p s production for is expected to be approximately percent higher than the level achieved in this projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in lukoil 
for  production increases in asia pacific  south america and the united states are expected to offset net declines in the north sea 
in r m  the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during we expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for to average in the upper nineties 
this projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in lukoil 
in january  the governor of alaska announced that effective february   most satellite fields surrounding the prudhoe bay field would no longer qualify for a state production tax incentive that was intended to encourage development of marginal deposits 
beginning in february  these satellite fields bear the same production tax rate as prudhoe bay 
this administrative change is anticipated to increase our production tax obligations by approximately million in 
table of contents in the first quarter of  in regards to our magnolia project in the gulf of mexico and on behalf of the garden banks unit  we filed an application for royalty relief with the minerals management service mms 
royalty relief may be granted if the value of the project using the mms economic model and criteria is insufficient to recover the project investment without the relief 
there is no assurance that such relief will be granted 
in february  the venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime 
the government has published legal instruments supporting the controls  one of which establishes official exchange rates for the us dollar 
the devaluation of the venezuelan currency by approximately percent in february did not have a significant impact on our venezuelan operations  however  future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our venezuelan operations 
in libya  we are participating in discussions with our co venturers and libyan authorities regarding terms in connection with our anticipated re entry into that country 
in the second quarter of  norwegian authorities ordered us to modify our facilities at two ekofisk area installations ekofisk and eldfisk and had initially given us until october   to submit a binding plan for implementing measures to ensure workers are not disturbed by noise from other sleeping workers while they are resting 
the norwegian petroleum safety authority contended we were not in compliance with regulatory requirements for rest and restitution on the installations where there are shared sleeping quarters 
we appealed this order and the response deadline was deferred by the norwegian authorities to december  concurrently  the petroleum safety authority put the appeal on hold pending further meetings and a letter describing plans that will ensure necessary restitution and rest 
on february   we received an official note from the petroleum safety authority stating that our letter of december   presented plans that will meet the intention of their order 
consequently  our appeal will not need to be processed further  and the case is closed 
the mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities for three anchor fields  including the parsons lake field operated by us  compression and gathering pipelines in the mackenzie delta area  and a pipeline system in the mackenzie river valley 
in september  the national energy board in canada confirmed the commercial discovery declaration cdd for the parsons lake field 
the cdd meets our development planning expectations  which is an important milestone in the regulatory approval process toward obtaining a production license 
the main regulatory applications were filed in october  triggering the start of the formal environmental and regulatory review process 
this filing sets the stage for regulatory hearings in  leading toward a regulatory decision in first gas production is currently targeted to commence in the timeframe 
in early july  we announced the finalization of our transaction with freeport lng development  lp freeport lng to participate in a proposed lng receiving terminal in quintana  texas 
freeport lng received conditional approval in june from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to construct and operate the facility and received final approval from the ferc in january construction began in early  and commercial startup is expected in we do not have any limited partner ownership interest in the facility  but we do have a percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture 
in addition  we have contractual rights to two thirds of the lng regasification capacity in the facility  or billion cubic feet per day 
we entered into a credit agreement with freeport lng  whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately million for the construction of the facility 

table of contents we are pursuing three other proposed lng regasification terminals 
the beacon port terminal would be located in federal waters in the gulf of mexico  miles south of the louisiana mainland 
also in the gulf of mexico is the proposed compass port terminal  to be located approximately miles offshore alabama 
the third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in the port of long beach  california 
each of these projects are in the initial regulatory permitting process 
in july  we signed a heads of agreement with qatar petroleum for the development of qatargas  a large scale lng project located in qatar and servicing the us natural gas market 
this provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies  both of which were advanced in qatargas would be an integrated project  jointly owned by qatar petroleum and us  consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from qatar s north field 
the lng would be shipped from qatar  and we would be responsible for regasification and marketing within the united states 
average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the timeframe 
in late october  we signed a heads of agreement with the nigerian national petroleum corporation  eni and chevrontexaco to conduct front end engineering and design feed work for an lng facility to be constructed in nigeria s central niger delta 
the participants formed an incorporated joint venture  brass lng limited  to undertake the project 
the feed contract was awarded to bechtel in the fourth quarter these engineering and design studies are expected to be completed in the lng facility is targeted to be operational in in december  we signed a statement of intent with qatar petroleum regarding the construction of a gas to liquids plant in ras laffan  qatar 
the statement of intent initiates technical and commercial pre feed studies and establishes principles for negotiating a heads of agreement for an integrated reservoir to market plant 
negotiations on more definitive agreements and progress on the studies continue in on february   conocophillips and duke energy corporation duke agreed to terms to restructure their respective ownership levels in defs  which would cause defs to become a jointly controlled venture  owned percent by each company 
this restructuring has been approved by the boards of directors of both owners 
we will increase our current percent ownership in defs to percent through a series of direct and indirect transfers of midstream assets from conocophillips to duke  a disproportionate cash distribution to duke from the sale of defs general partner interest in teppco partners  lp  and a final cash payment to duke of approximately million  which we expect to fund from our general liquidity resources 
we anticipate recording our equity share of the financial gain from defs sale of the general partner interest in teppco in the first quarter of the restructuring is expected to have the effect of significantly reducing the favorable basis difference in our investment in defs which  in turn  will significantly reduce the basis difference amortization reported in equity method earnings see note investments and long term receivables for more information on our basis difference in the defs investment 
we anticipate that this reduction in basis difference amortization and the loss of earnings from the transfer of certain of our midstream assets to duke and defs will be approximately offset by our increased percent share of the remaining defs earnings going forward 
the restructuring is expected to close in the second quarter of  subject to normal regulatory approvals 
once completed  our midstream segment will consist primarily of our percent equity method interest in defs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument market risk we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or interest rates 
we may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power  natural gas  crude oil and related products  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  or to exploit market opportunities 
our use of derivative instruments is governed by an authority limitations document approved by our board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the chief executive officer 
the authority limitations document also authorizes the chief executive officer to establish the maximum value at risk var limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily 
the chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  while the executive vice president of commercial monitors commodity price risk 
both report to the chief executive officer 
the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing  optimizes our commodity flows and positions  monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses  and selectively takes price risk to add value 
commodity price risk we operate in the worldwide crude oil  refined products  natural gas  natural gas liquids  and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 
these fluctuations can affect our revenues  as well as the cost of operating  investing  and financing activities 
generally  our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities  however  executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production  as well as refinery margins 
our commercial organization uses futures  forwards  swaps  and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain  which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives balance physical systems 
in addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration  exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity  providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand 
meet customer needs 
consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices  we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts  which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers  to a floating market price 
manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil  natural gas  refined product and electric power transactions 
enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business 
for the months ended december  and  the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations 

table of contents we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued  including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december   as derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
using monte carlo simulation  a percent confidence level and a one day holding period  the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december  and  was immaterial to our net income and cash flows 
the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december  and  was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows 
interest rate risk the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value 
the fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting billion of debt from fixed to floating rate 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of million of notes due  million of notes due  and million of notes due these swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting  so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge

we do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes  although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk 
examples include firm commitments for capital projects  certain local currency tax payments and dividends  and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year 
at december  and  we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between european subsidiaries and a us subsidiary 
although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates  we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by sfas no 
as a result  the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings 
since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower  there would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical percent change in the december  or  exchange rates
