overview general 
we are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services  including airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals  vacation packages and cruises 
we offer our customers a unique choice the ability to purchase certain travel services in a traditional  price disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique name your own price service  which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices 
at present  we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources transaction revenues from our name your own price airline ticket  hotel room and rental car services  as well as our vacation packages service  customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both name your own price and price disclosed airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars service  commissions primarily related to the sale of price disclosed hotel rooms  including those sold in europe by our subsidiary active hotels  rental cars  cruises and other travel services  worldspan reservation booking fees related to both our name your own price airline ticket  hotel room and rental car service  and price disclosed airline tickets and rental car service  transaction revenue from our price disclosed hotel room service  facilitated principally through our wholly owned subsidiary travelweb llc  and other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites 
trends 
our overall financial prospects have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and  as a result  the health of our business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry 
most domestic airlines  and many of our major suppliers  have experienced  and continue to experience  significant losses 
these losses have been compounded by competition from low cost carriers and  most recently  by high fuel prices  which we believe increase the possibility of the additional bankruptcy and or the liquidation of one or more of the major domestic airlines 
as a result of these and other factors  many of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain market share  simplified fare structures by removing restrictions associated with certain retail airline tickets and  as discussed in more detail in other below  put pressure on third party intermediaries like us to reduce airline distribution costs 
these actions have had  and continue to have  a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and  in particular  our name your own price airline ticket service  which represents a significant portion of our total airline ticket revenues 
deep retail discounting by the airlines negatively affects demand for our name your own price airline ticket service because it hurts our value proposition and makes users less willing to accept the trade offs associated with our service for what has become  in many cases  modest fare savings 
in addition  decreased airline capacity hurts our business by reducing the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our cost of inventory 
customer offer prices have not kept pace with the increase in our cost of inventory and are  therefore  lower in proportion to our average cost of supply  which has  for the better part of the last two years  materially and negatively affected the number of name your own price tickets sold 
in addition  in early  several major airline carriers simplified their retail fare structures  which removed or reduced the restrictions placed on certain fares for example  certain airlines  such as delta air lines and american airlines  eliminated certain saturday night stay requirements and reduced certain cancellation change fees and reduced the prices of their most expensive fares 
these fare restructurings negatively affected our name your own price airline ticket service in the same manner as retail discounting they hurt our value proposition and make users less willing to accept the trade offs associated with our name your own price service 
despite the trends associated with our name your own price airline ticket service  the online travel sector  overall  continues to grow  and in the last two years  we have embarked on a strategy to more broadly participate in that growth by expanding our service offerings and markets 
in an effort to participate in that growth and counter some of the trends described above  we have taken a number of initiatives to diversify our service offerings 
we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue among non opaque services  such as by allowing our customers to purchase price disclosed retail airline  hotel and rental car travel services  which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal 
to this end  in the fourth quarter of  we began offering customers the ability to purchase airline tickets at disclosed  retail prices 
we believe that the results of the launch of our retail airline ticket service  and the related marketing effort  have been positive and total unit sales of airline tickets increased in for the first time in two years 
the launch of a retail airline service has also had a positive effect on gross profit contribution 
while some customers presented with a display of low disclosed prices may opt to select such a ticket or make a lower offer for a name your own price ticket  we believe the gross profit contribution from the increased sale of retail airline tickets has  to date  more than offset any loss in the number of name your own price tickets sold 
as part of our strategy to broaden the appeal of our hotel service and lessen our dependence on our name your own price airline ticket service  we have invested in and focused our marketing efforts on our non airline travel services  including  in particular  our hotel business 
in  lowestfare 
com  our wholly owned subsidiary  acquired all of the equity interest in travelweb 
we intend to use inventory from travelweb to launch a price disclosed hotel service on the priceline 
com site in the first half of our intent is to provide customers maximum flexibility by allowing them to select a retail price disclosed itinerary or to make use of the name your own price service 
additionally  in september  we acquired active hotels 
we believe the acquisition creates opportunities for us to expand our businesses 
for example  active hotels has longstanding distribution relationships with a significant number of other european travel sites and we intend to support these relationships by providing access to us travel services 
in addition  we believe that we can offer active hotels services to our us customer base for european travel 
we also intend to continue to develop our other non air business  in particular our rental car and vacation package businesses  for which demand remains relatively strong 
in may  we launched a new retail rental car search and booking engine on rentalcars 
com  and in june  we implemented that functionality on breezenet 
com 
in october  we launched this search and booking engine on priceline 
com to allow customers to choose between an opaque or a disclosed rental car offering 
in addition  in the second quarter of  we implemented a new feature on our vacation packages path that allows customers to choose between an opaque or a disclosed price flight itinerary 
we currently offer vacation package purchasers the opportunity to purchase tickets  transfers  tours  discounted restaurant meals and other services available at their travel destinations 
we intend to expand this offering to other service paths 
we sell advertising to travel suppliers and others on our owned websites  including www 
priceline 
com  www 
lowestfare 
com  www 
travelweb 
com  www 
rentalcars 
com  www 
breezenet 
com and www 
mytravelguide 
com  a travel information site acquired in and relaunched with upgraded content in early with respect to our mortgage service  which is offered on our website through a joint venture and described above in item business products and services financial services  interest rates have increased from recent lows  which has resulted in a slowdown in home refinancings and a reduction in the number of loans that pricelinemortgage 
com originates 
a reduction in loan originations negatively affects the results of pricelinemortgage 
com and if this trend continues  our results attributable to pricelinemortgage 
com could be significantly impacted 
further terrorist attacks  hostilities in the middle east or elsewhere  the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in bankruptcy  the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline or hotel supplier  could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above 
other 
a number of travel suppliers  particularly airlines  have indicated publicly that  as part of an effort to reduce distribution costs  they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what they view to be expensive distribution channels such as global distribution systems gdss 
a number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the gds 
we have agreed to rebate certain gds costs to certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to inventory pricing and availability  and expects to continue to do so in the future 
additionally  travel suppliers are encouraging third party travel intermediaries  such as us  to develop technology enabling direct connections to bypass the gds 
development of direct connection technology would require the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects 
we have been and believe that we will continue to be under significant pressure from travel suppliers  including most of the major domestic airlines and many of our significant hotel suppliers  to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from worldspan  lp  our gds  and to significantly reduce or eliminate their distribution costs 
to the extent that we are required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive from our gds to travel suppliers  and are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers  or  if one or a number of travel suppliers pull out of our service because they are unhappy with existing distribution costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability  primarily from our leisure travel business  to continue to promote the priceline 
com brand and  over time  to offer other travel services on our website 
we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion  technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results 
we also intend to broaden the scope of our business  and to that end  we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of  among other things  mergers and acquisitions 
our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability 
the uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult  and accordingly  we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the items described below 
those estimates are based on  among other things  historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  is set forth below refunds 
in very limited circumstances  we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to customers 
based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers  we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from these accommodations 
in the event that we experience either an unanticipated increase in refunds or cancellations  as we did in the weeks following the terrorist attacks of september   or our suppliers refuse to accept certain refunds or cancellations or challenge refunds granted outside of their policies  our costs of revenues could increase 
allowance for credit card charge backs 
because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions  we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers 
additionally  we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record 
accordingly  we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs 
in the event we experience an unanticipated increase in fraudulent transactions on our website  our sales and marketing expense could increase 
equity investments 
we have a equity interest in pricelinemortgage 
com and  accordingly  recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage 
com s net income 
the carrying value of the investment at december  was million 
we periodically test this investment for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates 
in the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates  we could determine that some part or all of the carrying value of pricelinemortgage 
com is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles 
we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable 
the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies  market conditions  or the manner of use of an asset  under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results  and negative industry or economic trends 
in evaluating an asset for possible impairment  management estimates that asset s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable 
if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable  we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations 
tax valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance was recorded in the amount of billion at both december  and  representing the portion of tax operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized 
at december  we had approximately billion of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from december  to december   which are subject to limitation on future utilization under section of the internal revenue code of in the event that future operations indicate that some or all of these deferred tax benefits will be realized  we would recognize a tax provision credit for those estimated future tax benefits in our consolidated statement of operations 
the recognition of some or all of such future tax benefits would involve a significant amount of judgment by management 
in addition  the amount of annual benefit available under section is based upon certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the company on the dates of the ownership changes 
the overall determination of the annual section limitation is subject to interpretation  and therefore  the annual loss limitation could be subject to change 
merchant revenues and merchant cost of revenues name your own price services merchant revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and  among other things  select suppliers determine the price to be paid by the customer 
we recognize such revenue and costs if and when we accept and fulfill the customer s non refundable offer 
merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost  respectively  of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis 
pursuant to the terms of our hotel service  our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of time 
in the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the specified time period  we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts 
in very limited circumstances  we make certain customer accommodations to satisfy disputes and complaints 
we accrue for such estimated losses and classify the resulting expense as adjustments to merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues or the allowance for doubtful accounts  as appropriate 
travelweb merchant revenues for travelweb are derived from transactions where customers use the travelweb service to purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements 
charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included in deferred merchant bookings until the customer completes his or her stay 
such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay  subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases 
merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer s stay at the hotel 
travelweb records the difference between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue 
agency revenues and cost of revenues priceline 
com agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold are determined by third parties 
agency revenues include travel commissions  customer processing fees and worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received  without any associated cost of revenue 
such revenues are recognized when the travel transaction is completed on our website 
active hotels active hotels principal source of revenues comes from commission payments that it receives from hotel suppliers for acting as an agent in the booking of hotel rooms by customers 
active hotels hotel suppliers are billed for their commission payments owed to active hotels and it recognizes agency revenue at the time that its customers complete their stay at the hotel 
accounting for state and local taxes 
we file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses 
in addition  we pay sales and other taxes to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold through the priceline 
com service 
in certain cases  where appropriate  we remit taxes directly to the tax authorities 
we believe that this practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions 
however  one or more states could seek to impose additional income tax obligations  sales tax collection obligations  or other tax obligations on companies  such as ours  which engage in or facilitate online commerce 
a number of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services through the internet or the income derived from such sales 
to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline 
com service  we might have additional tax exposure 
we will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure  and to the extent appropriate  we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to businesses we have acquired including active hotels  travelweb and priceline 
com europe ltd 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques 
in the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates  we could determine that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded 
financial presentation starting with the three and nine months ended september   we began reporting online advertising and offline advertising instead of advertising expense on our unaudited consolidated statement of operations 
we made this change because travelweb and active hotels rely primarily on online advertising to drive their respective businesses  and our acquisitions of travelweb and active hotels have resulted in a large increase in our consolidated online advertising spending 
we have added a discussion of the operating metric gross bookings  which represents the total dollar value  inclusive of taxes and fees  of all travel services purchased by our customers 
in addition  starting with the three and nine months ended september   we began combining warrant costs with sales and marketing expenses  stock compensation expense with personnel costs and option taxes with general and administrative expenses  in order to better display the total cost of the associated activity 
in june  our stockholders approved a one for six reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
the reverse stock split was effected on june   and  as a result  our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately million to approximately million shares 
the par value of the common stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and remains at per share 
consequently  on our consolidated balance sheet  the aggregate par value of the issued common stock was reduced by reclassifying the par value amount of the eliminated shares of common stock to additional paid in capital 
all per share amounts and outstanding shares  including all common stock equivalents  have been retroactively restated 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating metrics our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services 
specifically  sales of airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers 
gross bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers 
the number of airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days sold were as follows year ended airline tickets hotel room nights rental car days gross bookings december  million million million  million december  million million million  million airline tickets sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was driven entirely by the introduction of retail choice to our airline service 
the growth in each period was partially offset by large annualized percentage decreases in sales of opaque airline tickets sold in each period 
see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview trends above 
hotel room nights sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was driven by the continued success of our opaque hotel service  which benefited from continued direct advertising support and the inclusion of hotel room nights sold by travelweb and active hotels during the respective periods in  subsequent to their acquisitions 
rental car days sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service through priceline 
com and our retail rental car service through priceline 
com  rentalcars 
com and breezenet 
com 
gross bookings increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was driven primarily by a increase in agency bookings in as a result of the introduction of retail choice to our airline service and the inclusion of approximately million of bookings from active hotels in our results 
gross bookings also increased as a result of an increase in merchant bookings in  as a result of the continued success of our opaque hotel  rental car and vacation package services which offset significant annualized declines in bookings of our opaque airline ticket service  and the inclusion of approximately million of bookings from travelweb in our results 
revenues we classify our revenue into three categories merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for  among other things  collecting receipts from our customers  remitting payments to our suppliers and establishes the price of the services we offer 
merchant revenues include the selling price  as established by us  of the opaque airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars and are reported on a gross basis  and the amount charged to a customer  less the amount charged by a supplier  in connection with a travelweb merchant hotel room 
agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties 
agency revenues include travel commissions  customer processing fees and worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received  without any associated cost of revenue 
other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites 
we continue to experience a shift in our airline ticket business mix from a historically merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail  price disclosed tickets 
because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis  airline ticket revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in merchant and retail sales mix and gross profit has become an important measure of evaluating growth in our business 
additionally  our acquisitions of travelweb and active hotels during the second and third quarters  respectively  contributed approximately million to our revenues in year ended december  change merchant revenues agency revenues other revenues total revenues merchant revenues merchant revenues for twelve months ended december   consisted primarily of transaction revenues representing the selling price of name your own price airline tickets  hotel rooms  rental cars and vacation packages  transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer  less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the sale of hotel rooms on travelweb  customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of name your own price airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars and ancillary fees  including worldspan  lp reservation booking fees related to name your own price transactions only 
the million increase in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to continued growth in name your own price hotels and our vacation package service  and the inclusion of approximately million of revenues from travelweb in  subsequent to our acquisition of travelweb  partially offset by a substantial decrease in the sale of name your own price airline tickets  and decreased travel caused by the adverse weather in the southeastern us during the third quarter of we believe that the decrease in the number of name your own price airline tickets sold and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended december  continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website 
in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoffs associated with our name your own price airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates  to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates  or from low cost carriers without having to make any trade offs 
agency revenues agency revenues for the twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of processing fees and third party supplier commissions related primarily to the sale of travel services including the sale of price disclosed hotels  rental cars  cruises and other travel services  and ancillary fees  including gds reservation booking fees related to price disclosed transactions 
agency revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased from the same period in  primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket business  driven primarily by new advertising campaigns focused on our retail airline ticket and vacation packages service  increased rental car business  including the impact of our acquisitions of rentalcars 
com and breezenet 
com  and the resulting increase in travel commissions  gds and processing fees earned  and the inclusion of approximately million of agency revenue from active hotels subsequent to our acquisition in september of other revenues other revenues during the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of advertising revenues  and fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage 
com for home financing services 
other revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of lower financial services fees and reduced on line advertising revenue 
cost of revenues and gross profit year ended december  change cost of merchant revenues of merchant revenues cost of agency revenues of agency revenues cost of other revenues of other revenues total cost of revenues of revenues cost of revenues during the twelve months ended december   cost of revenues decreased by approximately million  over the same period in  due primarily to a shift in the mix of revenue generated by services that produce higher gross margins 
specifically  our opaque hotel service  which produces the highest gross margins of our four principal opaque offerings  represented a higher percentage of total opaque revenues in as compared to conversely  our opaque airline service  which produces lower gross margins  declined significantly on a year over year basis  and therefore represented a substantially lower percentage of total opaque revenues in as compared to cost of revenues grew at a slower rate than revenues because opaque transactions  whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue  represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions principally travelweb that are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues 
cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers  net of hotel occupancy tax  the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers  net of the federal air transportation tax  segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets  the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers  net of applicable taxes  and non cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of travelweb 
cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended december   decreased approximately compared to the same period in  due primarily to the shift in the mix of revenue generated by services that generate different levels of gross margins  as discussed above 
cost of agency revenues agency revenues are recorded at their net amount  which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers  if any  and therefore  there are no costs of agency revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of active hotels 
cost of other revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  there were no costs of other revenues 
gross profit total gross profit increased for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  by approximately million primarily as a result of increased revenue from our opaque hotel and vacation package services  increased sales of retail services  and the inclusion of results from travelweb and active hotels 
total gross margin gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue increased during the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in  because opaque transactions  whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue  represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions which are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues 
because merchant transactions are reported gross and retail transactions primarily travelweb are recorded on a net basis  we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues during the year ended december   we experienced a decrease in total revenue of approximately million primarily due to a decline in the sale of merchant airline tickets  partially offset by the improved performance of our hotel and rental car services 
additionally  we have experienced a shift in our airline ticket business mix from a primarily merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail  price disclosed tickets 
because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis  revenues could decrease and gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business 
the number of airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days sold were as follows year ended airline tickets hotel room nights rental car days gross bookings december  million million million  million december  million million million  million gross bookings declined for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in primarily as a result of a decline in the sale of merchant airline tickets  partially offset by the improved performance of our hotel and rental car services 
revenues for the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of merchant revenues  agency revenues  and other revenues 
year ended december  change merchant revenues agency revenues other revenues total revenues merchant revenues merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be paid by the customer 
merchant revenues for the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of transaction revenues representing the selling price of name your own price airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars  customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of name your own price airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars and ancillary fees  including worldspan  lp reservation booking fees for merchant transactions only 
the approximately million decrease in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of name your own price tickets sold  which was partially offset by the improved performance of our name your own price hotel and rental car services 
we believe that the decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended december  continued to be due primarily to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us 
in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoffs associated with our name your own price airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates or from low cost carriers without having to make any trade offs 
in addition  many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   and upon the outbreak of war in iraq and the outbreak of sars  thus decreasing capacity on existing flights  which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us 
in addition  in the past  we have subsidized certain name your own price offers to purchase merchant airline tickets by adding a variable amount to some customers offers to increase the likelihood that such customers offers would be successful 
these subsidies had the effect of  among other things  increasing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our merchant revenues but at the expense of lower gross margins 
at the end of  we made the strategic decision to reduce sales of subsidized airline tickets 
to this end  we reduced subsidies we have historically applied to certain merchant airline ticket offers 
while this has had the effect of reducing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our revenue during  it has positively contributed to our gross profit and gross margin 
the year over year decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold  and the corresponding effect it had on our merchant revenue  was partially offset by the increase in hotel room nights and rental car days sold in the twelve months ended december  we believe that the increase in hotel room night sold during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same periods in was principally driven by our emphasis on our hotel business  and specifically by the success of our advertising campaign focused on our hotel service  and the competitive room inventory and pricing we receive from our hotel partners 
we believe the increase in rental car days sold during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same periods in was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our rental car service  which we believe was driven by  among other things  an increase in visits to our website as a result of our advertising  and an overall increase in demand for leisure rental cars generally  improvements we made to the presentation of our rental car service on our website and improvement in the inventory and pricing we receive from our rental car partners 
agency revenues agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of products are determined by third parties 
agency revenues for the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of processing fees and third party supplier commissions related to the sale of travel services including the sale of price disclosed airline tickets  cruises and other travel services  and ancillary fees  including gds reservation booking fees related to price disclosed transactions 
agency revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased approximately from the same period a year ago  primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket and rental car business and the resulting increase in travel commissions and processing fees earned 
other revenues other revenues during twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of advertising revenues  fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage 
com for home financing services and to aig for travel insurance and in automobile services  in  transaction revenue from our long distance phone service  which we repositioned in  and in  license fees from hutchison priceline limited

cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended december   decreased approximately  primarily due to a decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets  as discussed above 
cost of agency revenues 
agency revenues are recorded at their net amount  which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers  if any 
cost of other revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   cost of other revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone service provided by our suppliers 
for the twelve months ended december   there were no such costs due to the repositioning of our long distance telephone service in the fourth quarter of gross profit 
total gross profit decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   by million primarily as a result of the decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets  described above 
partially offsetting the reduction in total gross profit was growth in merchant hotel and rental car gross profit as well as an increase in agency gross profit 
total gross profit  expressed as a percentage of total revenue  increased during the period ended december  compared to the same period during as a result of an ongoing shift in our business mix from primarily merchant opaque transactions  reported on a gross basis  to include more retail agency transactions  recorded on a net basis 
because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis  gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business

for the twelve months ended december   merchant gross profit decreased from the same period in  primarily due to the continued weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us  factors which are described in merchant revenues  above  in more detail 
as discussed in merchant revenues above  at the end of  we strategically reduced subsidies applied to certain name your own price airline ticket sales 
while this resulted in a reduction in merchant revenues  the subsidy reduction positively affected our gross profit and increased our gross margin 
we are able to manage the level of gross margins by controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled 
our merchant gross margin in the twelve months ended december  increased over the same periods a year ago primarily as the result of a shift in mix of our services from the sale of airline tickets to the sale of hotel room nights and rental car days 
agency gross profit

general and administrative expenses decreased during the twelve months ended december  compared with the same periods in as a result of decreases in employment agency fees  taxes and stock based compensation  partially offset by higher professional fees and premiums on our directors and officers liability insurance policies

in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million 
this restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non travel businesses and a reduction in headcount 
the repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business 
the charge relates primarily to severance payments  real estate costs and asset impairments 
as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring  our work force was reduced by full time employees at our norwalk location and full time employees at our europe location

the real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer needed  and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space 
asset impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects  and software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain service offerings and activities 
other restructuring charges include professional and other fees and costs incurred in associated with the restructuring activities 
during and  we decreased the liability for the restructuring charge by approximately  and approximately  respectively

impairment charge during the third quarter of  we performed impairment tests and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill of million related to our european operations exceeded its implied fair value by approximately million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of million 
the fair value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including the market value of comparable companies including revenue multiple methodology and discounted cash flow 
underlying the impairment was a continued decline in the market value of priceline 
com s common stock  which we review quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment of priceline 
com europe ltd 
s carrying value  a deterioration in priceline 
com europe ltd 
s operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among european online travel companies and a decision in the third quarter of to reconfigure service offerings 
during the third quarter of we performed a periodic evaluation of the progress of the operations of hutchison priceline limited 
factors including increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as negative gross margins and continuing operating losses  negative net asset position and an increasingly competitive operating environment led us to determine that the carrying value of our convertible note no longer reflected its fair value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates and a review of the market value of comparable companies including the consideration of the decline in our market value and through discussion with third party valuation specialists

cash equivalents and short term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid  high quality  investment grade debt instruments 
all of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers over a ten to fifteen day period 
we therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter 
this can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments  including an interest rate hedge to manage market risks 
the objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement  cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuations in interest rates on a daily basis 
this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators  discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future interest rates 
we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future interest rate exposure that we may face 
our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended december  based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at december   we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future 
as of december   after adjusting for the effect of the interest rate swap agreement  we have fixed rate debt of approximately million 
we estimate that the fair market value of our debt was approximately million as of december  as of december   we held an interest rate swap agreement on million notional value of our fixed rate debt 
the fair value cost if terminated of this swap as of december  was approximately  a adverse fluctuation in the month libor rate as of december   would decrease the interest rate swap s fair value by approximately  any increase or decrease in the fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability  or cash flow 
international net revenues result from transactions by active hotels and are typically denominated in british pounds  the functional currency of active hotels 
active hotels also incurs most of its expenses in british pounds 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as well as our results of operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of active hotels are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
in january  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on the operating results of active hotels 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the currency translation gains and losses recognized in other accumulated comprehensive income 
no forward contracts or other economic hedges were entered into during the year ended december   however  we may enter into such forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future 
we convert the financial statements of active hotels into us dollars 
when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of active hotels financial statements into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss 
translation exposure is the change in the book value of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses that results from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
from time to time we may enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options and forward contracts 
additionally  fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate volatility 
to the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions  priceline 
com would also be affected by such changes
