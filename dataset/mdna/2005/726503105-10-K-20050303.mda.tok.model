item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our financial condition and results of our operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our discussion and analysis includes the following executive summary acquisitions critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting pronouncements and change in accounting principle results of operations outlook liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements risk factors related to our business executive summary company overview plains all american pipeline  lp is a delaware limited partnership formed in september of our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through our operating subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  plains pipeline  lp and plains marketing canada  lp we are engaged in interstate and intrastate crude oil transportation  and crude oil gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage  as well as the marketing and storage of liquefied petroleum gas and other petroleum products 
we refer to liquified petroleum gas and other petroleum products collectively as lpg 
we have an extensive network of pipeline transportation  terminalling  storage and gathering assets in key oil producing basins and at major market hubs in the united states and canada 
we are one of the largest midstream crude oil companies in north america 
as of december   we owned approximately  miles of active crude oil pipelines  approximately million barrels of active terminalling and storage capacity and over transport trucks 
currently  we handle an average of over million barrels per day of physical crude oil through our extensive network of assets located in major oil producing regions of the united states and canada 
our operations consist of two operating segments i pipeline operations pipeline operations and ii gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations gmt s 
through our pipeline segment  we engage in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation and certain related margin activities 
through our gmt s segment  we engage in purchases and resales of crude oil and lpg at various points along the distribution chain and we operate certain terminalling and storage assets 
overview of operating results and significant activities during  we recognized net income and earnings per limited partner unit of million and  respectively  both of which were substantial increases over and the results for as compared to the two previous years include significant contributions from acquisitions completed during and the following significant activities impacted our operations  operating results or our financial position during effective april   we acquired all of the north american crude oil and pipeline operations of link energy llc link for approximately million 
additionally  effective march   we completed the acquisition of all of shell pipeline company lp s interests in two entities for approximately million including a million deposit paid in december 
the principal assets of the shell entities are i an approximate undivided joint interest in the capline pipeline system  and ii an approximate undivided joint interest in the capwood pipeline system 
we maintained the relative strength of our overall capital structure and maintained substantial liquidity through a series of equity issuances and senior notes issuances 
we also entered into new credit facilities which expanded and extended the size and maturity of our prior facilities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we realized year over year growth in segment profit from both our pipeline operations segment and our gmt s segment 
this growth was primarily driven by i the impact of the current year acquisitions subsequent to their acquisition during  ii inclusion of a full year contribution from those assets that we acquired during  and iii the positive results  in relatively volatile market conditions  of our counter cyclically balanced activities in our gmt s segment 
we changed our method of accounting for pipeline linefill in third party assets resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge of million 
see recent accounting pronouncements and change in accounting principle 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to recognize an expense when vesting of units under our long term incentive plan ltip becomes probable as determined by management 
our results of operations for include a charge of million 
recognized a foreign exchange gain of million related to the impact of changes in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate on a net us dollar denominated liability of our canadian subsidiary 
this is primarily attributable to our lpg business  a substantial amount of which is transacted in us dollars 
recognized a lower of cost or market inventory charge of approximately million related to a valuation adjustment on our lpg inventory 
this charge is linked to the foreign exchange gain mentioned above  and is effectively a partial reversal of that gain 
this is primarily because of a stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar at the date of measurement compared to at the time of purchase 
recognized a non cash gain of approximately million resulting from the mark to market of open derivative instruments pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 as amended sfas 
recognized a non cash charge of approximately million associated with taking our pipeline system in the illinois basin out of service 
this pipeline did not support spending the capital necessary to continue service and we shifted the majority of the gathering and transport activities to trucks 
as a result  we were able to maintain most of our margins 
prospects for the future we believe we have access to equity and debt capital and that we are well situated to optimize our position in and around our existing assets and to expand our asset base by continuing to consolidate  rationalize and optimize the north american crude oil infrastructure 
we have deliberately configured our assets to provide a counter cyclical balance between our gathering and marketing activities and our terminalling and storage activities 
we believe the combination of these balanced activities adds stability to the portion of our business that is highly cyclical  and with our relatively stable  fee based pipeline assets  enables us to generate stable financial results 
during we strengthened our business by expanding our asset base through acquisitions and internal growth projects 
we operate in a mature industry and believe that our primary source of growth will come from acquisitions  and we believe that there are opportunities for acquisitions 
we will continue to pursue the purchase of midstream crude oil assets  and we will also continue to initiate projects designed to optimize crude oil flows in the areas in which we operate 
we believe the outlook is positive for  and have a strategic initiative of increasing our participation in  the importing of foreign crude oil  primarily through building a meaningful asset presence to enable us to receive foreign crude oil via the gulf coast 
we also believe there are opportunities for us to grow our lpg business 
in addition  we believe we can  and will pursue opportunities to  leverage our assets  business model  knowledge and expertise into investments in businesses complementary to our crude oil and lpg activities 
although we believe that we are well situated in the north american crude oil infrastructure  we face various operational  regulatory and financial challenges that may impact our ability to execute our strategy as planned 
see risk factors related to our business for further discussion of these items 
we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to us 
acquisitions we completed a number of acquisitions in  and that have impacted the results of operations and liquidity discussed herein 
the following acquisitions were accounted for  and the purchase price was allocated  in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations in and followed the provisions of that statement for all business combinations initiated after june  our ongoing acquisition activity is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below 
acquisitions in  we completed several acquisitions for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the aggregate consideration includes cash paid  estimated transaction costs and assumed liabilities and net working capital items 
the following table summarizes our acquisitions  and a description of each of these follows the table acquisition effective date acquisition cost operating segment in millions capline and capwood pipeline systems pipeline link energy llc pipeline gmt s cal ven pipeline system pipeline schaefferstown propane storage facility gmt s other various gmt s total acquisitions capline and capwood pipeline systems 
in march  we completed the acquisition of all of shell pipeline company lp s interests in two entities for approximately million in cash including a million deposit paid in december and approximately million of transaction and other costs 
in december  subsequent to the announcement of the acquisition and in anticipation of closing  we issued approximately million common units for net proceeds of approximately million  after paying approximately million of transaction costs 
the proceeds from this issuance were used to pay down the outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility 
at closing  the cash portion of this acquisition was funded from cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the principal assets of the entities are i an approximate undivided joint interest in the capline pipeline system  and ii an approximate undivided joint interest in the capwood pipeline system 
the capline pipeline system is a mile  inch mainline crude oil pipeline originating in st 
james  louisiana  and terminating in patoka  illinois 
the capwood pipeline system is a mile  inch mainline crude oil pipeline originating in patoka  illinois  and terminating in wood river  illinois 
the results of operations and assets from this acquisition the capline acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements and in our pipeline operations segment since march  these pipelines provide one of the primary transportation routes for crude oil shipped into the midwestern us and delivered to several refineries and other pipelines 
the purchase price was allocated as follows in millions crude oil pipelines and facilities crude oil storage and terminal facilities land office equipment and other total link energy llc 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the north american crude oil and pipeline operations of link for approximately million  including million of cash and approximately million of net liabilities assumed and acquisition related costs 
the link crude oil business consists of approximately  miles of active crude oil pipeline and gathering systems  over million barrels of active crude oil storage capacity  a fleet of approximately owned or leased trucks and approximately million barrels of crude oil linefill and working inventory 
the link assets complement our assets in west texas and along the gulf coast and allow us to expand our presence in the rocky mountain and oklahoma kansas regions 
the results of operations and assets from this acquisition the link acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements and both our pipeline operations and gmt s operations segments since april  the purchase price was allocated as follows and includes goodwill primarily related to link s gathering and marketing business in millions cash paid for acquisition fair value of net liabilities assumed accounts receivable other current assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities other current liabilities other long term liabilities total net liabilities assumed total purchase price purchase price allocation property and equipment inventory linefill inventory in third party assets goodwill other long term assets total cash paid does not include the subsequent payment of various transaction and other acquisition related costs 
accounts receivable and accounts payable are gross and do not reflect the adjustment of approximately million to net settle  based on contractual agreements with our counterparties 
the total purchase price includes i million in transaction costs  ii approximately million related to a plan to involuntarily terminate and relocate employees in conjunction with the acquisition  and iii approximately million related to costs to terminate a contract assumed in the acquisition 
these activities are substantially complete and the majority of the related costs have been incurred as of december  in addition  we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately million million in to upgrade certain of the assets and comply with certain regulatory requirements 
the acquisition was initially funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities as well as under a new million  day credit facility 
in connection with the acquisition  on april   we completed the private placement of  class c common units to a group of institutional investors 
during the third quarter of  we completed a public offering of common units and the sale of unsecured senior notes 
a portion of the proceeds from these transactions was used to retire the million  day credit facility 
cal ven pipeline system 
on may  we completed the acquisition of the cal ven pipeline system from cal ven limited  a subsidiary of unocal canada limited 
the total purchase price was approximately million  including transaction costs 
the transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
the cal ven pipeline system includes approximately miles of inch and inch gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines 
the system is located in northern alberta and delivers crude oil into the rainbow pipeline system 
the rainbow pipeline system then transports the crude south to the edmonton market  where it can be used in local refineries or shipped on connecting pipelines to the us market 
the results of operations and assets from this acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements and our pipeline operations segment since may  schaefferstown propane storage facility 
in august  we completed the acquisition of the schaefferstown propane storage facility from koch hydrocarbon  lp the total purchase price was approximately million  including transaction costs 
in connection with the transaction  we also acquired an additional million of inventory 
the transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
the results of operations and assets from this acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements and our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment since august  acquisitions during  we completed ten acquisitions for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the aggregate consideration includes cash paid  estimated transaction costs  assumed liabilities and estimated near term capital costs 
the acquisitions were initially financed with borrowings under our credit facilities  which were subsequently repaid with a portion of the proceeds from our equity issuances and the issuance of senior notes 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the businesses acquired during impacted our results of operations commencing on the effective date of each acquisition as indicated below 
these acquisitions included mainline crude oil pipelines  crude oil gathering lines  terminal and storage facilities  and an underground lpg storage facility 
with the exception of million that was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets and million associated with crude oil linefill and working inventory  the remaining aggregate purchase price was allocated to property and equipment

on august   we acquired interests in approximately  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines and approximately million barrels net to our interest of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage assets in west texas from shell pipeline company lp and equilon enterprises llc the shell acquisition for approximately million 
the primary assets included in the transaction are interests in the basin pipeline system  the permian basin gathering system and the rancho pipeline system 
the entire purchase price was allocated to property and equipment 
the acquired assets are primarily fee based mainline crude oil pipeline transportation assets that gather crude oil in the permian basin and transport the crude oil to major market locations in the mid continent and gulf coast regions 
the permian basin has long been one of the most stable crude oil producing regions in the united states  dating back to the s 
the acquired assets complement our existing asset infrastructure in west texas and represent a transportation link to cushing  oklahoma  where we provide storage and terminalling services 
the rancho pipeline system was taken out of service in march  pursuant to the operating agreement 
see business and properties dispositions shutdown and sale of rancho pipeline system 
other acquisitions 
during february and march of  we completed two other acquisitions for aggregate consideration totaling million  with effective dates of february  and march   respectively 
these acquisitions include an equity interest in a crude oil pipeline company and crude oil gathering and marketing assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that we have identified are discussed below 
purchase and sales accruals 
we routinely make accruals based on estimates for certain components of our revenues and cost of sales due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
where applicable  these accruals are based on nominated volumes expected to be purchased  transported and subsequently sold 
uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead  access to certain qualities of crude oil  pipeline capacities and delivery times  utilization of truck fleets to transport volumes to their destinations  weather  market conditions and other forces beyond our control 
these estimates are generally associated with a portion of the last month of each reporting period 
we currently estimate that less than of total annual revenues and cost of sales are recorded using estimates and less than of total quarterly revenues and cost of sales are recorded using estimates 
accordingly  a variance from this estimate of would impact the respective line items by less than on both an annual and quarterly basis 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition  because of the high volume  low margin nature of our business  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
variances from estimates are reflected in the period actual results become known  typically in the month following the estimate 
mark to market accrual 
in situations where we are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to sfas  the estimates of gains or losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
we reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
a portion of the estimates we use are based on internal models or models of third parties because they are not quoted on a national market 
additionally  values may vary among different models due to a difference in assumptions applied such as the estimate of prevailing market prices  volatility  correlations and other factors and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market 
less than of total revenues are based on estimates derived from these models 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
contingent liability accruals 
we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including  but not limited to  environmental remediation  insurance claims  asset retirement obligations and potential legal claims 
accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome 
among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for  and potential modification of  our remediation plans  the limited amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination  changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment  costs of medical care associated with worker s compensation and employee health insurance claims  and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims 
our estimates for contingent liability accruals are increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for the contingent liabilities discussed above would have an approximate million impact on earnings 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets 
in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we also estimate the amount of transaction costs that will be incurred in connection with each acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  we may adjust the original estimates within a short time period subsequent to the acquisition 
in addition  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the asset  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life determined by management 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  as well as intangible assets that relate to such items as customer relationships  contracts  and industry expertise involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired and  to the extent available  third party assessments 
uncertainties associated with these estimates include changes in production decline rates  production interruptions  fluctuations in refinery capacity or product slates  economic obsolescence factors in the area and potential future sources of cash flow 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
recent accounting pronouncements and change in accounting principle recent accounting pronouncements buy sell transactions 
the emerging issues task force eitf is currently considering issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  eitf no 
 which relates to buy sell transactions 
the issues to be addressed by the eitf are i under what circumstances should two or more transactions with the same counterparty be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction within the scope of apb no 
 and ii if nonmonetary transactions within the scope of apb no 
involve inventory  are there any circumstances under which the transactions should be recognized at fair value 
buy sell transactions are contractual arrangements in which we agree to buy a specific quantity and quality of crude oil or lpg to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or lpg at a different location  usually with the same counterparty 
these arrangements are generally designed to increase our margin through a variety of methods  including reducing our transportation or storage costs or acquiring a grade of crude oil that more closely matches our physical delivery requirement to one of our other customers 
the value difference between purchases and sales is referred to as margin and is primarily due to grade  quality or location differentials 
all buy sell transactions result in us making or receiving physical delivery of the product  involve the attendant risks and rewards of ownership  including title transfer  assumption of environmental risk  transportation scheduling  credit risk and counterparty nonperformance risk  and such transactions are settled in cash similar to all other purchases and sales 
accordingly  such transactions are recorded in both revenues and purchases as separate sales and purchase transactions on a gross basis 
we believe that buy sell transactions are monetary in nature and thus outside the scope of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb no 

additionally  we have evaluated eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf no 
and  based on that evaluation  we believe that recording these transactions on a gross basis is appropriate 
if the eitf were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as monetary transactions on a gross basis  no change in our accounting policy for buy sell transactions would be necessary 
if the eitf were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions qualifying for fair value recognition and require a net presentation of such transactions  the amounts of revenues and purchases associated with buy sell transactions would be netted in our consolidated statement of operations  but there would be no effect on operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities 
if the eitf were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions not qualifying for fair value recognition  these amounts of revenues and purchases would be netted in our consolidated statement of operations and there could be an impact on operating income and net income related to the timing of the ultimate sale of product purchased in the buy side of the buy sell transaction 
however  we do not believe any impact on operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities would be material 
earnings per unit 
in march  the emerging issues task force issued issue no 
eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities  other than common stock  that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf was effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf may have an impact on earnings per limited partner unit in future periods if net income exceeds distributions or if other participating securities are issued 
the effect of applying eitf on prior periods was not material except for the year ended december   which has been restated as shown below 
basic and diluted income before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle per limited partner unit for the year ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas or eitf after the adoption of sfas but prior to the adoption of eitf after the adoption of both sfas and eitf sfas rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
change in accounting principle during the second quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for pipeline linefill in third party assets 
historically  we have viewed pipeline linefill  whether in our assets or third party assets  as having long term characteristics rather than characteristics typically associated with the short term classification of operating inventory 
therefore  previously we have not included linefill barrels in the same average costing calculation as our operating inventory  but instead have carried linefill at historical cost 
following this change in accounting principle  the linefill in third party assets that we have historically classified as a portion of pipeline linefill on the face of the balance sheet a long term asset and carried at historical cost  is included in inventory a current asset in determining the average cost of operating inventory and applying the lower of cost or market analysis 
at the end of each period  we reclassify the linefill in third party assets not expected to be liquidated within the succeeding twelve months out of inventory a current asset  at average cost  and into inventory in third party assets a long term asset  which is now reflected as a separate line item within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
this change in accounting principle was effective january  and is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as of january   is a charge of approximately million  representing a reduction in inventory of approximately million  a reduction in pipeline linefill of approximately million and an increase in inventory in third party assets of million 
the pro forma impact for the periods ended december  and is detailed below reported year ended december  impact of change in accounting principle year ended december  pro forma year ended december  in millions  except per unit amounts net income basic income per limited partner unit diluted income per limited partner unit in conjunction with this change in accounting principle  we have classified cash flows associated with purchases and sales of linefill on assets that we own as cash flows from investing activities instead of the historical classification of cash flows from operating activities 
accordingly  our statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and has been revised to reclassify the cash paid for linefill in assets owned from operating activities to investing activities 
as a result of this change in classification  net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and increased to million from million and to million from million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and increased to million from million and million from million  respectively 
results of operations analysis of operating segments our operations consist of two operating segments i pipeline operations and ii gmt s operations 
through our pipeline segment  we engage in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation and certain related margin activities 
through our gmt s segment  we engage in purchases and resales of crude oil and lpg at various points along the distribution chain and we operate certain terminalling and storage assets 
we believe that the combination of our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
in a contango market oil prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we use our tankage to improve our gathering margins by storing crude oil we have purchased at lower prices in the current month for delivery at higher prices in future months 
in a backwardated market oil prices for future deliveries are lower than for current deliveries  we use less storage capacity  but increased marketing margins premiums for prompt delivery provide an offset to this reduced cash flow 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit and maintenance capital 
we define segment profit as revenues less i purchases  ii field operating costs and iii segment general and administrative g a expenses 
each of the items above excludes depreciation and amortization 
as a master limited partnership  we make quarterly distributions of our available cash as defined in our partnership agreement to our unitholders 
therefore  we look at each period s earnings before non cash depreciation and amortization as an important measure of segment performance 
the exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense could be viewed as limiting the usefulness of segment profit as a performance measure because it does not account in current periods for the implied reduction in value of our capital assets  such as crude oil pipelines and facilities  caused by aging and wear and tear 
management compensates for this limitation by recognizing that depreciation and amortization are largely offset by repair and maintenance costs  which keep the actual value of our principal fixed assets from declining 
these maintenance costs are a component of field operating costs included in segment profit or in maintenance capital  depending on the nature of the cost 
maintenance capital consists of capital expenditures required either to maintain the existing operating capacity of partially or fully depreciated assets or to extend their useful lives 
capital expenditures made to expand our existing capacity  whether through construction or acquisition  are not considered maintenance capital expenditures 
repair and maintenance expenditures associated with existing assets that do not extend the useful life or expand the operating capacity are charged to expense as incurred 
see note operating segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

the proportional allocations by segment require judgement by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
amounts related to sfas are included in revenues and impact segment profit 
pipeline operations as of december   we owned approximately  miles of which approximately  miles are included in our pipeline segment of active gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines located throughout the united states and canada 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting volumes of crude oil for a fee and third party leases of pipeline capacity collectively referred to as tariff activities  as well as barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements collectively referred to as pipeline margin activities 
in connection with certain of our merchant activities conducted under our gathering and marketing business  we are also shippers on certain of our own pipelines 
these transactions are conducted at published tariff rates and eliminated in consolidation 
tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems vary by receipt point and delivery point 
the segment profit generated by our tariff and other fee related activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff and other fees charged as well as the fixed and variable field costs of operating the pipeline 
segment profit from our pipeline capacity leases  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements generally reflect a negotiated amount

segment g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent total volumes transported for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the period 
revenues from both our tariff activities and our pipeline margin activities have increased over the three year period ended december  the increase in revenues from tariff activities in both the and periods is primarily related to increased volumes resulting from our acquisition activities as discussed further below 
the increase in revenue from our pipeline margin activities was related to higher average prices for crude oil sold and transported on our sjv gathering system in each of the years compared to the year prior 
the increase in was partially offset by lower buy sell volumes as compared to  while the period benefitted from higher buy sell volumes as compared to 
because the barrels that we buy and sell are generally indexed to the same pricing indices  revenues and purchases will increase and decrease with changes in market prices without significant changes to our margins related to those purchases and sales 
our buy sell arrangements in our pipeline segment consisted of the following year ended december  barrels per day    revenues in millions purchases in millions margin in millions increases in segment profit  our primary measure of segment performance  were driven by the following increased volumes and related tariff revenues the increase in volumes and related tariff revenues in versus is primarily related to the link acquisition  the capline acquisition and other acquisitions completed during and late similar increases in compared to are related to the acquisitions made in  as well as the inclusion of the assets acquired in for a full year as compared to only a portion of higher realized prices on our loss allowance oil higher crude oil prices during as compared to the nymex average for was per barrel versus per barrel in have resulted in increased revenues related to loss allowance oil 
increased field operating costs our continued growth  primarily from the link acquisition and other acquisitions completed during and late is the principal driver of the increase in field operating costs for the increased costs are primarily in payroll and benefits and utilities 
the results also include a million charge for a pipeline release of oil 
in addition  costs related to pipeline and storage regulation have increased by approximately million in the increase in field operating costs in as compared to was predominantly related to growth from acquisitions and higher utility costs 
the period also includes a million ltip charge and a million charge for a release of oil from a pipeline 
increased segment g a expenses the increase in segment g a expenses in is primarily related to the link acquisition coupled with the increase in the percentage of indirect costs allocated to the pipeline operations segment in the period as our pipeline operations have grown 
g a costs have also increased because of increased headcount from our continued growth and higher costs related to compliance activities attributable to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
costs related to section compliance were million in these items were partially offset by the inclusion of an ltip charge of approximately million in the period compared to million in the period 
the increase in as compared to is primarily related to the ltip charge mentioned above  an overall increase in costs from our continued growth from acquisitions and increased indirect costs allocated to the pipeline operations segment as operations grew 
as discussed above  the increase in pipeline operations segment profit is largely related to our acquisition activities 
we have completed a number of acquisitions during and that have impacted our results of operations 
the following presentation summarizes the revenue and volume impact of recent acquisitions 
year ended december  revenues volumes revenues volumes revenues volumes volumes in thousands of barrels per day and revenues in millions tariff activities acquisitions n a n a n a n a acquisitions n a n a acquisitions all other pipeline systems total tariff activities  revenues include intersegment amounts 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent total volumes transported for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the period 
the increase in is predominately related to i the inclusion of an average of  barrels per day and million of revenues from the pipelines acquired in the link acquisition  ii the inclusion of an average of approximately  barrels per day and million of revenues from the capline pipeline system and iii  barrels per day and million of revenues from other acquisitions 
additionally  volumes and revenues have increased as a result of the inclusion for the full year of of several pipeline systems acquired during as compared to only a portion of the year in see acquisitions  coupled with higher realized prices on our loss allowance oil 
revenues from all other pipeline systems increased in the period  primarily related to slightly higher volumes on various systems 
the appreciation of canadian currency also favorably impacted revenues 
the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate appreciated to an average of to for the year ended december   compared to an average of to for the year ended december  the increase in relates to various acquisitions completed in along with the inclusion of assets acquired in for an entire year compared to only a portion of maintenance capital for the periods ended december   and  maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million  respectively for our pipeline operations segment 
the increase in is because of the growth of our business  primarily related to the link acquisition 
the increase in is related to our continued growth  primarily through acquisitions 
gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations as of december   we owned approximately million barrels of active above ground crude oil terminalling and storage facilities  including a crude oil terminalling and storage facility at cushing  oklahoma 
cushing  which we refer to as the cushing interchange  is one of the largest crude oil market hubs in the united states and the designated delivery point for new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  crude oil futures contracts 
terminals are facilities where crude oil is transferred to or from storage or a transportation system  such as a pipeline  to another transportation system  such as trucks or another pipeline 
the operation of these facilities is called terminalling 
approximately million barrels of our million barrels of tankage is used primarily in our gmt s operations segment and the balance is used in our pipeline operations segment 
on a stand alone basis  segment profit from terminalling and storage activities is dependent on the throughput of volumes  the volume of crude oil stored and the level of fees generated from our terminalling and storage services 
our terminalling and storage activities are integrated with our gathering and marketing activities and the level of tankage that we allocate for our arbitrage activities and therefore not available for lease to third parties varies throughout crude oil price cycles 
this integration enables us to use our storage tanks in an effort to counter cyclically balance and hedge our gathering and marketing activities 
in a contango market when oil prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we use our tankage to improve our gathering margins by storing crude oil we have purchased at lower prices in the current month for delivery at higher prices in future months 
in a backwardated market when oil prices for future deliveries are lower than for current deliveries  we use less storage capacity  but increased marketing margins premiums for prompt delivery provide an offset to this reduced cash flow 
we believe that this combination of our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
our revenues from gathering and marketing activities reflect the sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil and lpg volumes  plus the sale of additional barrels exchanged through buy sell arrangements entered into to supplement the margins of the gathered and bulk purchased volumes 
because the commodities that we buy and sell are generally indexed to the same pricing indices for both the purchase and the sale  revenues and costs related to purchases will increase and decrease with changes in market prices 
however  the margins related to those purchases and sales will not necessarily have corresponding increases and decreases 
for example  our revenues increased approximately in compared to  while our segment profit increased approximately in the same period 
revenues from our gmt s operations were approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues and costs related to purchases for the period were impacted by higher average prices and higher volumes as compared to the period 
approximately of the increase in revenues resulted from higher average prices in the period and the remainder was attributable to increased sales volumes 
the average nymex price for crude oil was per barrel and per barrel for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues and costs related to purchases in was related to higher average prices and higher volumes in as compared to the average nymex price for crude oil was per barrel in our buy sell arrangements in our gmt s segment consisted of the following year ended december  barrels per day    revenues in millions purchases in millions    margin in millions include certain estimates based on management s judgment  such estimates are not expected to have a material impact on the balances 
generally  we expect our segment profit to increase or decrease directionally with increases or decreases in lease gathered volumes and lpg sales volumes 
although we believe that the combination of our lease gathering business and our storage assets provides a counter cyclical balance that provides stability in our margins  these margins are not fixed and may vary from period to period 
in order to evaluate the performance of this segment  management focuses on the following metrics i segment profit  ii crude oil lease gathered volumes and lpg sales volumes and iii segment profit per barrel calculated on these volumes 
the following table sets forth our operating results from our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment for the periods indicated december  in millions  except per barrel amounts operating results revenues    purchases and related costs    field operating costs excluding ltip charge ltip charge operations segment g a expenses excluding ltip charge ltip charge general and administrative segment profit noncash sfas impact maintenance capital segment profit per barrel average daily volumes thousands of barrels per day crude oil lease gathered crude oil bulk purchases total lpg sales revenue and purchases include intersegment amounts 
segment g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
amounts related to sfas are included in revenues and impact segment profit 
calculated based on crude oil lease gathered barrels and lpg sales barrels 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent total volumes transported for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the period 
increases in segment profit  our primary measure of segment performance  were driven by the following increased crude oil lease gathered volumes and lpg sales volumes the crude oil volumes gathered from producers  using our assets or third party assets  have increased by approximately in the increase is primarily related to the link acquisition  which has offset natural production declines 
in addition  we marketed  barrels per day of lpg during compared to  barrels per day in favorable market conditions during  market conditions were favorable as the crude oil market experienced significant volatility and the market shifted between backwardation and contango multiple times during the year 
additionally  price differentials between grades of crude oil were wider than normal  enhancing results 
the nymex benchmark price of crude ranged from to during the period 
this volatile market allowed us to optimize and enhance the margins of both our gathering and marketing assets and our terminalling and storage assets at different times during the period 
the market conditions in were also favorable as there was relatively high volatility and strong backwardation throughout the period 
during  the nymex benchmark price of crude ranged from to per barrel 
additionally  in the first quarter of  cold weather throughout the us and canada led to increased lpg sales and higher margins 
change in impact from the sfas mark to market adjustment the period included a non cash gain of approximately million resulting from the mark to market of open derivative instruments pursuant to sfas  while the and periods included non cash gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
impact of change in canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate the period includes a foreign exchange gain of million 
the gain is related to the impact of changes in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate on a net us dollar denominated liability of our canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this is primarily attributable to our lpg business  a substantial amount of which is transacted in us dollars 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustment the period included a charge of approximately million related to a valuation adjustment on our lpg inventory 
this charge is linked to the foreign exchange gain mentioned above  and is effectively a partial reversal of that gain 
increased tankage available to our gathering and marketing business as a result of various acquisitions and expansion at our cushing terminal  the average amount of tankage available increased to million barrels in from million barrels in and million barrels in increased field operating costs our continued growth  primarily from the link acquisition is the primary driver of the increase in field operating costs for as compared to this increase was partially offset by the million charge related to our ltip in the period compared to million in field operating costs increased in as compared to primarily because of the ltip charge mentioned above 
the remaining increase was partially related to our growth in  primarily related to acquisitions  coupled with increased regulatory compliance activities and higher fuel costs 
increased segment g a expenses g a increased in  primarily related to an increase in employees resulting from continued growth and higher costs related to compliance activities attributable to sarbanes oxley section compliance partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of indirect costs allocated to the gmt s operations segment as the growth in our pipeline operations segment has outpaced growth in our gmt s operations segment 
costs related to section compliance were million in the increase is partially offset by the million charge related to our ltip in compared to million in the increase in g a in as compared to is primarily related to the ltip charge mentioned above  partially offset by the decrease in indirect costs allocated to the gmt s segment from period to period as our pipeline operations segment has grown 
the impact of the items discussed above resulted in segment profit per barrel calculated based on our lease gathered crude oil and lpg barrels of per barrel for  compared to for both and maintenance capital for the periods ended december   and  maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million  respectively for our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment 
the increase in as compared to is primarily related to the link acquisition 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily because of a reduction in costs associated with information systems and the replacement of a portion of our fleet in other income and expenses unallocated g a expenses segment g a expenses include the costs directly associated with the segments  as well as a portion of corporate overhead costs considered allocable 
total g a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have included in the above segment discussion the g a expenses for each of these years that were attributable to our segments either directly or by allocation 
during  we were unsuccessful in our pursuit of several sizable acquisition opportunities determined by auction and one negotiated transaction that had advanced nearly to the execution stage when it was abruptly terminated by the seller 
as a result  our results reflect a million charge to g a expenses associated with the third party costs of these unsuccessful transactions 
this charge was not allocated to the segments 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in relates primarily to the assets from our acquisitions and our various acquisitions being included for the full year versus only a part of the year in in addition  includes approximately million of depreciation of trucks and trailers under capital leases 
amortization of debt issue costs was million in  compared to million in the increase in over relates primarily to the inclusion of the assets from the shell acquisition for the entire year as compared to a portion of additionally  several acquisitions were completed during the year along with various capital projects 
amortization of debt issue costs was flat between the two years 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  our average debt balance was million 
this balance consisted of fixed rate senior notes averaging million and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities averaging million 
during the period  our average debt balance was approximately million and consisted of fixed rate senior notes averaging million and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities averaging million 
the higher average debt balance in was primarily related to the portion of our acquisitions that were not refinanced with equity 
our financial growth strategy is to fund our acquisitions using a balance of debt and equity 
during the third quarter of  we issued million of five year senior unsecured notes and million of year senior unsecured notes 
these issuances resulted in an increase in the average amount of longer term and higher cost fixed rate debt outstanding in to approximately as compared to approximately in during and  the average three month libor rate was and  respectively 
the higher average debt balance in resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million  while at the same time our commitment and other fees decreased by approximately million 
our weighted average interest rate  excluding commitment and other fees  was approximately for compared to for the lower weighted average rate decreased interest expense by approximately million in compared to the increase in compared to was primarily related to an increase in the average debt balance during the period to approximately million from approximately million in the period  which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million 
the higher average debt balance was primarily due to the portion of the shell acquisition that was not financed with equity 
this debt was outstanding for all of versus only a portion of also  increased commitment and other fees coupled with lower capitalized interest resulted in approximately million of the increase in the period 
our weighted average interest rate decreased slightly during to versus in  which decreased our interest expense by approximately million 
although the change in our weighted average interest rate was nominal  the change was the net result of various factors that included an increase in the amount of fixed rate debt with longer maturities  long term interest rate hedges and declining short term interest rates 
in mid september  we issued million of ten year bonds bearing a fixed interest rate of 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we entered into hedging arrangements to lock in interest rates on approximately million of its floating rate debt 
in addition  the average three month libor rate declined from approximately during to approximately during the net impact of these factors  increased commitment fees and changes in average debt balances decreased the average interest rate by 
other during the third quarter of  we completed i the issuance of  common units and ii the issuance of an aggregate of million of senior unsecured notes 
we used the proceeds from these issuances to  among other things  repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities  including all amounts outstanding under the million  day facility we used to fund the link acquisition 
the repayment and termination of this facility resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million associated with taking our pipeline system in the illinois basin out of service 
the impairment represents the remaining net book value of the idled pipeline system 
this pipeline did not support spending the capital necessary to continue service and we shifted the majority of the gathering and transport activities to trucks 
as a result  we were able to maintain most of our margins 
during the fourth quarter of we completed the refinancing of our bank credit facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities totaling million and a million uncommitted facility for the purchase of hedged crude oil see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities and long term debt 
in addition  during the third quarter of we made a million prepayment on our senior secured term b loan in anticipation of the refinancing 
the completion of these transactions resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
outlook this section identifies certain matters of risk and uncertainty that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future 
ongoing acquisition activities 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase by us of transportation  gathering  terminalling or storage assets and related businesses 
these acquisition efforts often involve assets which  if acquired  would have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in an effort to prudently and economically leverage our asset base  knowledge base and skill sets  management has also expanded its efforts to encompass businesses that are closely related to  or significantly intertwined with  the crude oil business 
we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to us 
ocs production 
in october  plains exploration and production pxp announced that it had successfully completed an initial development well into the rocky point field  which is accessible from the point arguello platforms and that drilling operations are underway on a second development well 
we can give no assurances  however  that our volumes transported would increase as a result of this drilling activity 
pipeline integrity and storage tank testing compliance 
although we believe our short term estimates of costs under the pipeline integrity management rules and api and similar canadian regulations are reasonable  a high degree of uncertainty exists with respect to estimating such costs  as we continue to test existing assets and as we acquire new assets 
sarbanes oxley act and related legislation 
several regulatory and legislative initiatives were introduced in and in response to developments during and regarding accounting issues at large public companies  resulting disruptions in the capital markets and ensuing calls for action to prevent recurrence of similar events 
we believe implementation of reforms in connection with these initiatives have added to the costs of doing business for most publicly traded entities  including us as a partnership 
these costs will have an adverse impact on future income and cash flow 
longer term outlook 
our longer term outlook  spanning a period of five or more years  is influenced by many factors affecting the north american crude oil sector 
some of the more significant trends and factors include continued overall depletion of us crude oil production 
the continuing convergence of worldwide crude oil supply and demand trends 
aggressive practices in the us to maintain working crude oil inventory levels below historical levels despite rising demand in north america 
industry compliance with the department of transportation s adoption of the american petroleum institute s standard for testing and maintenance of storage tanks  which will require significant investments to maintain existing crude oil storage capacity or  alternatively  will result in a reduction of existing storage capacity by the expectation of increased crude oil production from certain north american regions primarily canadian oil sands and deepwater gulf of mexico sources that will  of economic necessity  compete for us markets currently being supplied by non north american foreign crude imports 
we believe the collective impact of these trends  factors and developments  many of which are beyond our control  will result in an increasingly volatile crude oil market that is subject to more frequent short term swings in market prices and grade differentials and shifts in market structure 
in an environment of reduced inventories and tight supply and demand balances  even relatively minor supply disruptions can cause significant price swings 
conversely  despite a relatively balanced market on a global basis  competition within a given region of the us could cause downward pricing pressure and significantly impact regional crude oil price differentials among crude oil grades and locations 
although we believe our business strategy is designed to manage these trends  factors and potential developments  and that we are strategically positioned to benefit from certain of these developments  there can be no assurance that we will not be negatively affected 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash generated from operations and our credit facilities are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  approximately million of availability under our committed revolving credit facilities and million of unused capacity under our uncommitted hedged inventory facility 
usage of the credit facilities is subject to compliance with covenants 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all covenants 
in january  we had additional net borrowings under our uncommitted hedged inventory facility of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to pay for crude oil stored at december  capital resources we periodically access the capital markets for both equity and debt financing 
in april  we completed the private placement of  units of class c common units to a group of institutional investors comprised of affiliates of kayne anderson capital advisors  vulcan capital and tortoise capital advisors for per unit 
total proceeds from the transaction  after deducting transaction costs and including the general partner s proportionate contribution  was approximately million 
in the third quarter of  we completed a public offering of  common units for per unit 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of units and approximately million from our general partner s proportionate capital contribution 
total costs associated with the offering  including underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million 
net proceeds of million were used to permanently reduce outstanding borrowings under the million  day credit facility 
in august  we completed the sale of million of senior notes 
we used the net proceeds  after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering costs  of approximately million to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facilities  including the remaining balance under the million  day facility we used to fund the link acquisition  and for general partnership purposes 
in connection with this repayment  we terminated the facility 
subsequent to the notes offering  we also terminated our million  day facility  which was scheduled to expire in november capital expenditures we have made and will continue to make capital expenditures for acquisitions  expansion capital and maintenance capital 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  credit facility borrowings  the issuance of senior unsecured notes and the sale of additional common units 
we expect to invest approximately million on expansion capital projects during our expansion capital projects include the following notable projects with the estimated cost for the entire year 
estimated to be incurred in in millions capital projects and upgrades associated with the link acquisition trenton pipeline expansion cushing phase v expansion cal ven fractionator capital projects and upgrades associated with the shell south louisiana assets acquisition other in addition  we expect to invest approximately million on maintenance capital projects during we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity 
cash flows cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are i the collection of amounts related to the sale of crude oil and lpg and the transportation of crude oil for a fee and ii the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil and lpg and other expenses  principally field operating costs and general and administrative expenses 
the cash settlement from the purchase and sale of crude oil during any particular month typically occurs within thirty days from the end of the month  except in the months that we store inventory because of contango market conditions or in months that we increase linefill 
the storage of crude oil in periods of a contango market can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period we pay for and store the crude oil and the subsequent period that we receive proceeds from the sale of the crude oil 
when we store the crude oil  we borrow on our credit facilities to pay for the crude oil so the impact on operating cash flow is negative 
conversely  cash flow from operations increases in the period we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil 
in addition  our cash flow from operating activities is also impacted by the level of lpg inventory stored at period end 
cash flow from operations was million in and reflects cash generated by our recurring operations that was offset negatively by several factors totaling approximately million 
the primary item was a net increase in hedged crude oil and lpg inventory and linefill in third party assets that was financed with borrowings under our credit facilities approximately million net 
cash flows from operations were also negatively impacted by a decrease of approximately million in prepayments received from counter parties to mitigate credit risk 
our positive cash flow from operations for resulted from cash generated by our recurring operations 
in addition  cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted by approximately million related to proceeds received in from the sale of hedged crude oil inventory and negatively impacted by approximately million related to inventory stored at the end of the proceeds from the sale of the stored crude oil were received in the first quarter of in  we also received approximately million of additional prepayments over the balance from counter parties to mitigate our credit risk  and paid approximately million to terminate an interest rate hedge in conjunction with a change in our capital structure 
our positive cash flow from operations for resulted from cash generated by our recurring operations 
in addition  we received approximately million of proceeds during associated with crude oil hedged and stored during this was partially offset by the payment of approximately million for crude oil purchased and stored during but for which receipt of the proceeds occurred during in addition  our cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted by the collection of approximately million of prepayments from counter parties to mitigate our credit risks and the collection of approximately million of amounts that had been outstanding primarily since and investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in  and consisted predominantly of cash paid for acquisitions 
net cash used in was approximately million and was comprised primarily of cash paid for acquisitions of million  which included i approximately million for the link acquisition  ii approximately million for the capline capwood acquisition a deposit of million was paid during  iii approximately million for the schafferstown propane storage facility including approximately million of working inventory and iv approximately million related to various other acquisitions 
investing activities for also included over million of property and equipment construction and capitalized maintenance projects  which includes approximately million related to the cushing to broome pipeline construction project 
net cash used in investing activities was million and was comprised of i an aggregate million paid primarily for ten acquisitions completed during  ii a million deposit paid on the capline acquisition  see acquisitions  iii proceeds of approximately million from sales of assets  and iv million paid for additions to property and equipment  including million related to the construction of crude oil gathering and transmission lines in west texas  and v crude oil linefill purchases of approximately million  primarily attributable to increased linefill requirements related to and acquisitions 
net cash used in was million and was comprised of i an aggregate million paid for three acquisitions completed during  see acquisitions  and ii million paid for additions to property and equipment  primarily related to our cushing expansion and the construction of the marshall terminal in canada  and iii crude oil linefill purchases of approximately million 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units  used primarily to fund acquisitions and pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities 
net borrowings under our short term and long term revolving credit facilities were million 
in addition  million of distributions were paid to our unitholders and general partner 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units and senior unsecured notes  used primarily to fund capital projects and acquisitions and pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities and senior term loans 
net repayments of our short term and long term revolving credit facilities and related senior term loans were million 
in addition  million of distributions were paid to our unitholders and general partner 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units and senior unsecured notes  used primarily to fund capital projects and acquisitions and pay down outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility 
net repayments of our short term and long term revolving credit facilities during were million 
in addition  million of distributions were paid to our unitholders and general partner during the year ended december  credit facilities and long term debt during august  we completed the sale of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due the notes were sold at of face value and the notes were sold at of face value 
we used the net proceeds  after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering costs  of approximately million to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facilities  including the remaining balance under the million  day facility funded in connection with the link acquisition  and for general partnership purposes 
in connection with this repayment  we terminated the facility 
subsequent to the notes offering  we also terminated our million  day facility that was scheduled to expire in november in november  we entered into a new million  five year senior unsecured credit facility  which contains a sub facility for canadian borrowings of up to million 
the new credit facility extends our maturities  lowers our cost of credit and provides an additional million of liquidity over our previous facilities 
this facility can be expanded to billion 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under this credit facility  as well as million in letters of credit outstanding  resulting in unused capacity under the facility of approximately million 
also in the fourth quarter of  we amended and renewed our secured hedged inventory facility  increasing the facility to million  with the ability to further increase the facility in the future by an incremental million 
this facility is an uncommitted working capital facility  which is used to finance the purchase of hedged crude oil inventory for storage when market conditions warrant 
borrowings under the hedged inventory facility are secured by the inventory purchased under the facility and the associated accounts receivable  and will be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of such inventory 
this facility expires in november as of december   we had approximately million outstanding and no letters of credit issued under our hedged crude oil inventory facility resulting in unused uncommitted capacity under this facility of approximately million 
our credit agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes contain cross default provisions 
our credit agreements prohibit distributions on  or purchases or redemptions of  units if any default or event of default is continuing 
in addition  the agreements contain various covenants limiting our ability to  among other things incur indebtedness if certain financial ratios are not maintained  grant liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  sell substantially all of our assets or enter into a merger or consolidation 
our credit facility treats a change of control as an event of default and also requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio that is not less than to  and a debt coverage ratio which will not be greater than to on all outstanding debt and to on all outstanding debt during an acquisition period generally  the period consisting of three fiscal quarters following an acquisition greater than million 
for covenant compliance purposes  letters of credit and borrowings to fund hedged inventory and margin requirements are excluded when calculating the debt coverage ratio 
a default under our credit facility would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt 
as long as we are in compliance with our credit agreements  our ability to make distributions of available cash is not restricted 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreements and indentures 
contingencies export license matter 
in our gathering and marketing activities  we import and export crude oil from and to canada 
exports of crude oil are subject to the short supply controls of the export administration regulations ear and must be licensed by the bureau of industry and security the bis of the us commerce department 
in  we determined that we may have violated the terms of our licenses with respect to the quantity of crude oil exported and the end users in canada 
export of crude oil except as authorized by license is a violation of the ear 
in october  we submitted to the bis an initial notification of voluntary disclosure 
the bis subsequently informed us that we could continue to export while previous exports were under review 
we applied for and received several new licenses allowing for export volumes and end users that more accurately reflect our anticipated business and customer needs 
we also conducted reviews of new and existing contracts and implemented new procedures and practices in order to monitor compliance with applicable laws regarding the export of crude oil to canada 
as a result  we subsequently submitted additional information to the bis in october and may in august  we received a request from the bis for additional information 
we have responded to this and subsequent requests  and continue to cooperate fully with bis officials 
at this time  we have received neither a warning letter nor a charging letter  which could involve the imposition of penalties  and no indication of what penalties the bis might assess 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of this matter 
alfons sperber v 
plains resources inc  et al 
on december   a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the delaware chancery court  new castle county  entitled alfons sperber v 
plains resources inc  et al 
this suit  brought on behalf of a putative class of plains all american pipeline  lp common unitholders  asserted breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims against us  plains aap  lp  and plains all american gp llc and its directors  as well as breach of fiduciary duty claims against plains resources inc and its directors 
the complaint sought to enjoin or rescind a proposed acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of plains resources inc  as well as declaratory relief  an accounting  disgorgement and the imposition of a constructive trust  and an award of damages  fees  expenses and costs  among other things 
this lawsuit has been settled in principle 
the court has approved the settlement and  assuming no appeals are filed  the settlement will become final in march pipeline releases 
in december and january  we experienced two unrelated releases of crude oil that reached rivers located near the sites where the releases originated 
in late december  one of our pipelines in west texas experienced a rupture that resulted in the release of approximately  barrels of crude oil  a portion of which reached a remote location of the pecos river 
in early january  an overflow from a temporary storage tank located in east texas resulted in the release of approximately  barrels of crude oil  a portion of which reached the sabine river 
in both cases  emergency response personnel under the supervision of a unified command structure consisting of representatives of plains pipeline  the us environmental protection agency  the texas commission on environmental quality and the texas railroad commission conducted clean up operations at each site 
approximately  barrels and barrels were recovered from the two respective sites 
the unrecovered oil has been or will be removed or otherwise addressed by paa in the course of site remediation 
aggregate costs associated with each release  including estimated remediation costs  are estimated at approximately million and million  respectively 
we continue to work with the appropriate state and federal environmental authorities in responding to the releases and no enforcement proceedings have been instituted by any governmental authority at this time 
general 
we  in the ordinary course of business  are a claimant and or a defendant in various legal proceedings 
we do not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental 
we may experience future releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline  gathering and storage operations  or discover past releases that were previously unidentified 
although we maintain an inspection program designed to prevent and  as applicable  to detect and address such releases promptly  damages and liabilities incurred due to any such environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business 
at december   our reserve for environmental liabilities totaled approximately million 
approximately million of the reserve is related to liabilities assumed as part of the link acquisition 
although we believe our reserve is adequate  no assurance can be given that any costs incurred in excess of this reserve would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
other 
a pipeline  terminal or other facility may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance covers our assets in amounts considered reasonable 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable and not excessive 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating pipelines  terminals and other facilities  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
the overall trend in the environmental insurance industry appears to be a contraction in the breadth and depth of available coverage  while costs  deductibles and retention levels have increased 
absent a material favorable change in the insurance markets  this trend is expected to continue as we continue to grow and expand 
as a result  we anticipate that we will elect to self insure more of our activities or incorporate higher retention in our insurance arrangements 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured  indemnified or reserved against  or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations  could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we believe we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations 
with respect to all of our coverage  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable  or that we have established adequate reserves to the extent that such risks are not insured 
commitments contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of doing business we purchase crude oil and lpg from third parties under contracts  the majority of which range in term from thirty day evergreen to three years 
we establish a margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sale and exchange transactions through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil and lpg purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
the table below includes purchase obligations related to these activities 
where applicable the amounts presented represent the net obligations associated with buy sell contracts and those subject to a net settlement arrangement with the counterparty 
we do not expect to use a significant amount of internal capital to meet these obligations  as the obligations will be funded by corresponding sales to credit worthy entities 
the following table includes our best estimate of the amount and timing of these payments as well as others due under the specified contractual obligations as of december  thereafter in millions long term debt and interest payments leases capital expenditure obligations other long term liabilities subtotal crude oil and lpg purchases  total  includes debt service payments  interest payments due on our senior notes and the commitment fee on our revolving credit facility 
while there is an outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility at december  this amount is included in the amounts above  we historically repay and borrow at varying amounts 
as such  we have included only the maximum commitment fee as if no amounts were outstanding on the facility in the amounts above 
leases are primarily for office rent and trucks used in our gathering activities 
excludes approximately million non current liability related to sfas which are included in crude oil and lpg purchases 
amounts are based on estimated volumes and market prices 
the actual physical volume purchased and actual settlement prices may vary from the assumptions used in the table 
uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead  weather conditions  changes in market prices and other conditions beyond our control 
letters of credit 
in connection with our crude oil marketing  we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil 
our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil is purchased 
generally  these letters of credit are issued for up to seventy day periods and are terminated upon completion of each transaction 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
distributions 
we plan to distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter less reserves established by our general partner for future requirements 
on february   we paid a cash distribution of per unit on all outstanding units 
the total distribution paid was approximately million  with approximately million paid to our common unitholders and approximately million paid to our general partner for its general partner million and incentive distribution interests million 
our general partner is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  our general partner is entitled  without duplication  to of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit  of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit and of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit 
in  we paid million in incentive distributions to our general partner 
see certain relationships and related transactions our general partner 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item of regulation s k 
risk factors related to our business the level of our profitability is dependent upon an adequate supply of crude oil from fields located offshore and onshore california 
production from these offshore fields has experienced substantial production declines since a significant portion of our segment profit is derived from pipeline transportation margins associated with the santa ynez and point arguello fields located offshore california 
we expect that there will continue to be natural production declines from each of these fields as the underlying reservoirs are depleted 
we estimate that a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline segment profit of approximately million 
in addition  any significant production disruption from the santa ynez field due to production problems  transportation problems or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our trading policies cannot eliminate all price risks 
in addition  any non compliance with our trading policies could result in significant financial losses 
generally  it is our policy that we establish a margin for crude oil purchased by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation under futures contracts on the nymex and over the counter 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
our policy is generally not to acquire and hold crude oil  futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes 
this policy cannot  however  eliminate all price risks 
for example  any event that disrupts our anticipated physical supply of crude oil could expose us to risk of loss resulting from price changes 
moreover  we are exposed to some risks that are not hedged  including certain basis risks and price risks on certain of our inventory  such as pipeline linefill  which must be maintained in order to transport crude oil on our pipelines 
in addition  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of crude oil 
although this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function  it exposes us to price risks within predefined limits and authorizations 
in addition  our trading operations involve the risk of non compliance with our trading policies 
for example  we discovered in november that our trading policy was violated by one of our former employees  which resulted in aggregate losses of approximately million 
we have taken steps within our organization to enhance our processes and procedures to detect future unauthorized trading 
we cannot assure you  however  that these steps will detect and prevent all violations of our trading policies and procedures  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved 
if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms our future growth may be limited 
our ability to grow is substantially dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in adjusted operating surplus per unit 
if we are unable to make such accretive acquisitions either because i we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them  ii we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or iii we are outbid by competitors  our future growth will be limited 
in particular  competition for midstream assets and businesses has intensified substantially and as a result such assets and businesses have become more costly 
as a result  we may not be able to complete the number or size of acquisitions that we have targeted internally or to continue to grow as quickly as we have historically 
our acquisition strategy requires access to new capital 
tightened capital markets or other factors which increase our cost of capital could impair our ability to grow 
our business strategy is substantially dependent on acquiring additional assets or operations 
we continuously consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions 
these transactions can be effected quickly  may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets and operations 
any material acquisition will require access to capital 
any limitations on our access to capital or increase in the cost of that capital could significantly impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our ability to maintain our targeted credit profile  including maintaining our credit ratings  could impact our cost of capital as well as our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our acquisition strategy involves risks that may adversely affect our business 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including performance from the acquired assets and businesses that is below the forecasts we used in evaluating the acquisition  a significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements  the inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets  the incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets  including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets prior to our acquisition  customer or key employee loss from the acquired businesses  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from our acquisitions  realize other anticipated benefits and our ability to pay distributions or meet our debt service requirements 
the nature of our assets and business could expose us to significant compliance costs and liabilities 
our operations involving the storage  treatment  processing  and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons including crude oil are subject to stringent federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  otherwise relating to protection of the environment  operational safety and related matters 
compliance with these laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities  or claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities  and the issuance of injunctions that may restrict or prohibit our operations or even claims of damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
the laws and regulations applicable to our operations are subject to change  and we cannot provide any assurance that compliance with current and future laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our results of operations or earnings 
a discharge of hazardous liquids into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject us to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and liability to private parties for personal injury or property damage 
the profitability of our pipeline operations depends on the volume of crude oil shipped 
third party shippers generally do not have long term contractual commitments to ship crude oil on our pipelines 
a decision by a shipper to substantially reduce or cease to ship volumes of crude oil on our pipelines could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
for example  we estimate that an average  barrel per day variance in the basin pipeline system within the current operating window  equivalent to an approximate volume variance on that system  would change annualized segment profit by approximately million 
in addition  we estimate that an average  barrel per day variance on the capline pipeline system  equivalent to an approximate volume variance on that system  would change annualized segment profit by approximately million 
the success of our business strategy to increase and optimize throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets is dependent upon our securing additional supplies of crude oil 
our operating results are dependent upon securing additional supplies of crude oil from increased production by oil companies and aggressive lease gathering efforts 
the ability of producers to increase production is dependent on the prevailing market price of oil  the exploration and production budgets of the major and independent oil companies  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that production of crude oil will rise to sufficient levels to cause an increase in the throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets 
our operations are dependent upon demand for crude oil by refiners in the midwest and on the gulf coast 
any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand for crude oil is dependent upon the impact of future economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce demand 
demand also depends on the ability and willingness of shippers having access to our transportation assets to satisfy their demand by deliveries through those assets  and any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
we face intense competition in our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage activities 
our competitors include other crude oil pipelines  the major integrated oil companies  their marketing affiliates  and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control greater supplies of crude oil 
we estimate that a variance in the average segment profit per barrel would have an approximate million annual effect on segment profit 
the profitability of our gathering and marketing activities is generally dependent on the volumes of crude oil we purchase and gather 
to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase  we must continue to contract for new supplies of crude oil to offset volumes lost because of natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors 
replacement of lost volumes of crude oil is particularly difficult in an environment where production is low and competition to gather available production is intense 
generally  because producers experience inconveniences in switching crude oil purchasers  such as delays in receipt of proceeds while awaiting the preparation of new division orders  producers typically do not change purchasers on the basis of minor variations in price 
thus  we may experience difficulty acquiring crude oil at the wellhead in areas where there are existing relationships between producers and other gatherers and purchasers of crude oil 
we estimate that a  barrel per day decrease in barrels gathered by us would have an approximate million per year negative impact on segment profit 
this impact is based on a reasonable margin throughout various market conditions 
actual margins vary based on the location of the crude oil  the strength or weakness of the market and the grade or quality of crude oil 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our gathering and marketing activities 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately assessed the credit worthiness of our existing or future counterparties or that there will not be an unanticipated deterioration in their credit worthiness  which could have an adverse impact on us 
in those cases in which we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with other parties 
our pipeline assets are subject to federal  state and provincial regulation 
our domestic interstate common carrier pipelines are subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc under the interstate commerce act 
the interstate commerce act requires that tariff rates for petroleum pipelines be just and reasonable and non discriminatory 
we are also subject to the pipeline safety regulations of the us department of transportation 
our intrastate pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies 
our canadian pipeline assets are subject to regulation by the national energy board and by provincial agencies 
with respect to a pipeline over which it has jurisdiction  each of these canadian agencies has the power to determine the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation on such pipeline 
the extent to which regulatory agencies can override existing transportation contracts has not been fully decided 
our pipeline systems are dependent upon their interconnections with other crude oil pipelines to reach end markets 
reduced throughput on these interconnecting pipelines as a result of testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced throughput on our pipeline systems that would adversely affect our profitability 
fluctuations in demand can negatively affect our operating results 
fluctuations in demand for crude oil  such as caused by refinery downtime or shutdown  can have a negative effect on our operating results 
specifically  reduced demand in an area serviced by our transmission systems will negatively affect the throughput on such systems 
although the negative impact may be mitigated or overcome by our ability to capture differentials created by demand fluctuations  this ability is dependent on location and grade of crude oil  and thus is unpredictable 
the terms of our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or capitalize on business opportunities 
as of december   our total outstanding long term debt was approximately million 
various limitations in our indebtedness may reduce our ability to incur additional debt  to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities 
any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
because we conduct operations in canada  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks that may adversely affect our results of operations 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves 
because distributions on the common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of the general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would substantially reduce our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders or pay our debt service obligations 
the after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend income  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the common units 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation could materially and adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders or to make payments on our debt securities 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
imposition of such forms of taxation would reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders and for payment of debt service obligations 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in i crude oil and lpg commodity prices  ii interest rates and iii currency exchange rates 
we utilize various derivative instruments to manage such exposure 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor interest rates  currency exchange rates  nymex and over the counter positions  and physical volumes  grades  locations and delivery schedules to ensure our hedging activities address our market risks 
we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies and our trading controls and procedures and certain aspects of corporate risk management 
to hedge the risks discussed above we engage in risk management activities that we categorize by the risks we are hedging 
the following discussion addresses each category of risk 
commodity price risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to crude oil and lpg in storage  and expected purchases and sales of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures and option contracts traded on the nymex and over the counter transactions  including crude oil swap and option contracts entered into with financial institutions and other energy companies 
our policy is to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the segment profit we receive 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our crude oil lease purchase and lpg activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of crude oil 
in order to hedge margins involving our physical assets and manage risks associated with our crude oil purchase and sale obligations  we use derivative instruments  including futures and options transactions  as well as over the counter instruments 
in analyzing our risk management activities  we draw a distinction between enterprise level risks and trading related risks 
enterprise level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on whether there is value in doing so 
conversely  trading related risks the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return are not inherent in the core business  rather  those risks arise as a result of engaging in the trading activity 
we have a risk management committee that approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process 
with the exception of the controlled trading program  our approved strategies are intended to mitigate enterprise level risks that are inherent in our core businesses of gathering and marketing and storage 
although the intent of our risk management strategies is to hedge our margin  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 
in such instances  changes in the fair values of these derivatives will receive mark to market treatment in current earnings  and result in greater potential for earnings volatility 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
all of our open commodity price risk derivatives at december  were categorized as non trading 
the fair value of these instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below in millions fair value effect of price decrease crude oil futures contracts swaps and options contracts lpg swaps and option contracts the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
the assumptions in these estimates as well as the source is maintained by the independent risk control function 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the cash market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt  and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
therefore  from time to time we utilize interest rate swaps and collars to hedge interest obligations on specific debt issuances  including anticipated debt issuances 
there are no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding as of december  the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for variable rate debt outstanding at december  all of our senior notes are fixed rate notes and their interest rates are not subject to market risk 
our variable rate debt bears interest at libor  prime or the bankers acceptance rate plus the applicable margin 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  the carrying values of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because interest rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates  and the credit spread on outstanding borrowings reflects market 
expected year of maturity thereafter total in millions liabilities short term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate currency exchange risk our cash flow stream relating to our canadian operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
because a significant portion of our canadian business is conducted in canadian dollars  we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of changes in the exchange rate 
these instruments include forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps 
neither the forward exchange contracts nor the cross currency swaps qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas at december   we had forward exchange contracts that allow us to exchange canadian dollars for us dollars  quarterly  at set exchange rates as detailed below canadian dollars us dollars rate in millions to to in addition  at december   we also had cross currency swap contracts for an aggregate notional principal amount of million effectively converting this amount of our us dollar denominated debt to million of canadian dollar debt based on canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate of to 
the notional principal amount reduces by million us in may and has a final maturity in may million us at december   million of our long term debt was denominated in canadian dollars million canadian based on a canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate of to 
all of these financial instruments are placed with what we believe to be large  creditworthy financial institutions 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments based on current termination values 
the table shown below summarizes the fair value of our foreign currency hedges by year of maturity in millions year of maturity total forward exchange contracts cross currency swaps total
