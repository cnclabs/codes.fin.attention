sales in the fluid handling equipment segment were million or higher than the fiscal year ended january  sales in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment were million or lower than the fiscal year ended january  the decreased sales in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment have been adversely impacted by an overall softness in the higher dollar capital equipment and systems markets  combined with atypical customer delays in issuing expected purchase orders for several large dollar projects

foreign sales increased in the fluid handling equipment segment from the prior fiscal year  and the product recovery pollution control equipment segment foreign sales were slightly lower than the prior fiscal year 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended january   a decrease of million 
the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the decreased sales in the product recovery pollution control segment  as discussed above  and by a decrease in gross margin  as discussed below 
the gross margin for the fiscal year ended january  was compared to for the same period in the prior year due to lower gross margins experienced in both operating segments 
the decrease in gross margin is principally due to product mix  competitive pricing pressures  and higher raw material and in bound freight costs  combined with the profit erosion sustained on a product recovery pollution control project which reduced our net income by approximately  or of the overall reduction in the gross margin for the fiscal year 
selling expense was million for the fiscal year ended january   a decrease of million over the prior year

this change is principally related to a reduction in legal expenses incurred in defending against allegations that products sold by one of the company s divisions infringed a competitor s intellectual property rights 
we settled this case in february neither the settlement nor the legal fees incurred after january  were material in the fiscal year ended january  the effective tax rate was for each of the fiscal years ended january  and fye vs fye net sales for the fiscal year ended january  were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended january   an increase of million 
sales in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment increased to million  higher than the prior year due primarily to increased demand for laboratory fume hood exhaust systems

foreign sales increased in the fluid handling equipment segment from the prior fiscal year  and the product recovery pollution control equipment segment foreign sales were higher than the prior fiscal year due to higher demand for our laboratory fume hood exhaust systems 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended january   an increase of million 
the increase in net income is principally related to higher sales and gross margin in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment during the current fiscal year

the company s cash flows from operating activities are influenced  in part  by the timing of shipments and negotiated standard payment terms  including retention associated with major projects 

index accounts receivable were million on january   a decrease of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the timing and size of shipments and retainage on contracts  especially in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment  will  among other factors  influence accounts receivable balances at any point in time 
inventories totaled million on january   an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
inventory balances will fluctuate  in part  with the size and timing of orders and market demand  especially when major systems and contracts are involved 
current liabilities amounted to million on january  compared to million on january   a decrease of million 
a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by an increase in customers advances  accounted for this decrease

capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended january  amounted to million compared with million in the fiscal year ended january   an increase of million

on october   the company s annual measurement date  the accumulated benefit obligation related to the company s pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets such excess is referred to as an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
this difference is due to the decline in the market value of assets in the company s non contributory defined benefit pension plan trust during the fiscal year ended january   combined with a reduction in the discount rate from to in the fiscal year ended january  in connection with this difference  the company s minimum pension liability as of january  was

 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support

r was effective for the company on february  and had no impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

sfas no 
r will require the fair value of all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period 
the statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no

index critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following the company s revenues are generally recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated and amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  effective february   the company s unamortized goodwill balance is not being amortized over its estimated useful life  rather  it is being assessed at least annually for impairment 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 
forward looking statements  factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risk 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these forward looking statements may be identified by words describing our belief or expectation  such as where we say that we believe  expect or anticipate  or where we characterize something in a manner in which there is an express or implicit reference to the future  such as non recurring or unusual  or where we express that our view is based upon the current status of a given matter  or upon facts as we know them as of the date of the statement 
the content and or context of other statements that we make may indicate that the statement is forward looking 
we claim the safe harbor provided by the private securities reform act of for all forward looking statements

the following important factors  along with those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  could affect our future financial condition and results of operations  and could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in our sec filings and in our forward looking statements the write down of costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill  as a result of the determination that the acquired business is impaired 
our flex kleen division  which initially performed well after being acquired by met pro  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior year 
during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis of the million of goodwill that the company carries for flex kleen and concluded that no impairment has occurred 
flex kleen s performance needs to continue to improve in order for us not to be required to write off some or all of its goodwill  materially adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us or in significant customers of ours  material changes in available technology  adverse developments in the asbestos cases that have been filed against the company  including without limitation the exhaustion of insurance coverage  the imposition of punitive damages or other adverse developments in the availability of insurance coverage  changes in accounting rules promulgated by regulatory agencies  including the sec  which could result in an impact on earnings  
index the cost of compliance with sarbanes oxley and other applicable legal and listing requirements  and the unanticipated possibility that met pro may not meet these requirements  unexpected results in our product development activities  loss of key customers  changes in product mix and the cost of materials  with effect on margins  changes in our existing management  exchange rate fluctuations  changes in federal laws  state laws and regulations  lower than anticipated return on investments in the company s defined benefit plans  which could affect the amount of the company s pension liabilities  the assertion of litigation claims that the company s products  including products produced by companies acquired by the company  infringe third party patents or have caused injury  loss or damage  the effect of acquisitions and other strategic ventures  failure to properly quote and or execute customer orders  including misspecifications  design  engineering or production errors  the cancellation or delay of purchase orders or shipments  losses related to international sales  and or failure in execution of acquisition strategy
