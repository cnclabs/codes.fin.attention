item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company  through its subsidiaries  underwrites a diverse portfolio of group employee benefit products  primarily group life  disability  and excess workers compensation insurance 
revenues from this group of products are primarily comprised of earned premiums and investment income 
the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by  among other things  differences between actual and projected claims experience  the retention of existing customers  product mix and the company s ability to attract new customers  change premium rates and contract terms and control administrative expenses 
the company transfers its exposure to some group employee benefit risks through reinsurance ceded arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
accordingly  the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by the amount  cost and terms of reinsurance obtained by the company 
the profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company is continuing to experience favorable market conditions for its excess workers compensation products  due to higher primary workers compensation rates 
for its other group employee benefit products  the company is maintaining its underwriting discipline under competitive market conditions  and is continuing to increase the size of its sales force in order to enhance its focus on the small case niche insured groups of to individuals  including employers which are first time providers of these employee benefits  which it believes to offer opportunities for superior profitability 
the company also operates an asset accumulation business that focuses primarily on offering fixed annuities to individuals 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation business consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
revenues from the company s asset accumulation business are primarily comprised of investment income earned on the funds under management 
the profitability of asset accumulation products is primarily dependent on the spread achieved between the return on investments and the interest credited to annuity holders 
the company is disciplined in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products in order to achieve its targeted interest rate spreads on these products  and is willing to accept lower levels of sales on these products when market conditions make these targeted spreads more difficult to achieve 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
a discussion of how management applies certain critical accounting policies is presented below under the caption critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company 
in addition  a discussion of uncertainties and contingencies which can affect actual results and could cause actual results to ultimately differ materially from those described below can be found under the caption forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results

on average  sirs increased in sncc has continued to obtain moderate price increases on its renewals and sir levels on average are up 
in addition  retention of existing customers for excess workers compensation products in was higher than in excess workers compensation new business production  which represents the amount of new annualized premium sold  was million in as compared with exceptionally strong production in of million 
the significantly higher renewal ratio and rate increases offset the decline in new business production as the company focused on achieving rate increases on its existing business and maintained pricing and underwriting discipline as to new sales

premiums from non core group employee benefit products were million in as compared to million in deposits from the company s asset accumulation products were million in as compared to million in these deposits consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
the company continues to maintain its discipline in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products  since the interest rate spreads available on these products remained below average throughout and the increase in deposits from the company s asset accumulation products in was primarily due to an increase in the number of independent agents and marketing companies distributing the company s annuity products 
the company plans to maintain its discipline in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products in in order to achieve its targeted interest rate spreads on these products 
net investment income 
net investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
the level of net investment income in the period reflects an increase in average invested assets in partially offset by a decrease in the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield 
the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield on invested assets was on average invested assets of  million in and on average invested assets of  million in net realized investment gains 
net realized investment gains were million in as compared to million in the company s investment strategy results in periodic sales of securities and  therefore  the recognition of realized investment gains and losses 
during and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of net gains on the sales of securities 
the company monitors its investments on an ongoing basis 
when the market value of a security declines below its cost  and management judges the decline to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value  and the decline is reported as a realized investment loss 
in and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market values of certain fixed maturity securities 
the losses of this type in million on an after tax basis resulted primarily from credit quality related deterioration in certain municipal and asset backed securities and the company may recognize additional losses of this type in the future 
the company anticipates that if certain other existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million  on an after tax basis  with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may be outside this range 
the company continuously monitors the affected securities pursuant to its procedures for evaluation for other than temporary impairment in valuation 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for a description of these procedures  which take into account a number of factors 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of these procedures  with respect to these securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
benefits and expenses 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects the increase in premiums from the company s group employee benefit products discussed above 
the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio for the company s group employee benefits segment was in and in benefits and expenses related to the company s asset accumulation products decreased million primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average annual crediting rate on these products  which reflects the effects of the first year bonus crediting rate on certain newly issued products  from in to in income tax expense

core group employee benefit products include group life  disability  excess workers compensation  travel accident and dental insurance 
premiums from excess workers compensation insurance for self insured employers increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the favorable pricing environment and strong demand for this product driven by a growing shift among employers toward self insuring their workers compensation risks due to higher primary workers compensation rates

the period did not include any premiums from lpts 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation products were million in as compared to million in these deposits consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
the company continued to maintain its discipline in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products  since the interest rate spreads available on these products remained below average throughout and the decrease in deposits from the company s asset accumulation products in was primarily due to strong equity market performance during the second half of and the continuing low interest rate environment which reduced demand for fixed annuity products

in and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market values of certain fixed maturity and equity securities 
benefits and expenses 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects the increase in premiums from the company s group employee benefit products discussed above 
the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio for the company s group employee benefits segment was in and in benefits and expenses related to the company s asset accumulation products increased by million primarily due to an increase in average funds under management from million in to million in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase primarily resulted from the company s issuance of the senior notes and the capital securities in may and the fact that the senior notes and the matured senior notes were simultaneously outstanding until the matured senior notes could be repaid at their maturity in october income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in as compared to million in the company s effective tax rate was in and in the increase in the company s effective tax rate during was primarily due to an increase in income taxed at the company s marginal tax rate as a result of net realized investment gains in as compared to net realized investment losses in liquidity and capital resources general 
the company had approximately million of financial resources available at the holding company level at december   which was primarily comprised of short term investments  investments in the common stock of its investment subsidiaries  and fixed maturity securities 
the assets of the investment subsidiaries are primarily invested in balances with independent investment managers 
a shelf registration statement is also in effect under which securities yielding proceeds of up to million may be issued by the company 
other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include dividends paid from subsidiaries  primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments 
during  the company s insurance subsidiaries will be permitted  without prior regulatory approval  to make dividend payments totaling million 
the company s insurance subsidiaries may also pay additional dividends with the requisite regulatory approvals 
see business regulation 
in general  dividends from the company s non insurance subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory or other restrictions 
at december   the company had million of borrowings available under its revolving credit facility 
the company s current liquidity needs  in addition to funding its operating expenses  include principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility  interest payments on the senior notes  and distributions on the capital securities and the capital securities 
the maximum amount of borrowings available under the company s revolving credit facility  which expires in december  is million 
the company intends to obtain an extension of  or replace  the revolving credit facility prior to its maturity 
the senior notes mature in their entirety in may and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements but are redeemable by the company at par at any time on or after may  the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying the capital securities are not redeemable prior to march  the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying the capital securities are redeemable  in whole or in part  beginning may  see notes d and j to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
the senior notes and the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries are assumed to be repaid on their respective maturity dates 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the table contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands other long term liabilities      corporate debt note d    interest on corporate debt note d      advances from federal home loan bank note e    interest on advances from federal home loan bank note e      junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries note j   interest on junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures note j      operating lease obligations note m      total contractual obligations      other long term liabilities consist of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to the company s insurance products  as well as policyholder account balances 
substantially all of the amounts contained in this table with respect to such liabilities consist of estimates by the company s management based on various actuarial and other assumptions relating to mortality  morbidity  claim termination and  as to policyholder account balances  the periods for which the related annuity and other contracts will remain in force and the crediting rates to be applied thereto in the future 
in accordance with gaap  a substantial portion of such liabilities  as they relate to the company s insurance products  are carried on a discounted basis on its consolidated balance sheet  however  the amounts contained in this table are presented on an undiscounted basis 
the actual payments relating to these liabilities will differ  both in amount and timing  from those indicated in this table 
see critical accounting policies 
primarily includes interest on the senior notes 
includes interest on the outstanding junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities and the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures was computed using the indexed rate in effect at december  of 
sources of liquidity available to the company on a parent company only basis  including the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries and additional borrowings available under the company s revolving credit facility  are expected to exceed the company s current and long term cash requirements 
the company from time to time engages in discussions with respect to acquiring blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are their contractual obligations to policyholders and other financing sources 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of these subsidiaries 
the company actively manages its investment portfolio to match its invested assets and related liabilities 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
see asset liability management and market risk 
therefore  the company believes that these sources of funding will be adequate for its insurance subsidiaries to satisfy on both a short term and long term basis these contractual obligations throughout their estimated or stated period 
however  if such contractual obligations were to arise more rapidly or in greater amounts than anticipated in the company s asset liability matching analysis  the company could be required to sell securities earlier than anticipated  potentially resulting in the realization of capital losses particularly  as regards fixed income securities  in a rising interest rate environment  or to borrow funds from available credit sources  in order to fund the payment of such obligations 
in any of such events  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
cash flows 
operating activities increased cash by million  million and million in   and  respectively 
net investing activities used million of cash during primarily for the purchase of securities  and financing activities provided million of cash principally due to deposits from asset accumulation products partially offset by the repayment of certain advances from the federal home loan bank 
share repurchase program 
the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program 
share repurchases are effected by the company in the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of execution of the share repurchase program is based on management s assessment of market conditions for its common stock and other potential uses of capital 
the company did not repurchase any shares in at december   the repurchase of approximately million shares remained authorized under this program 
during  the company received  shares of the company s class a common stock with an aggregate value of million in liquidation of a partnership interest 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy emphasizes safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  by focusing on  among other things  managing the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and seeking to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio  which totaled  million at december   primarily consists of investments in fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
during  the market value of the company s investment portfolio  in relation to its amortized cost  remained at the same level as in  before related changes in the cost of business acquired of million and the income tax provision of million 
in addition  the company recognized pre tax net investment gains of million in the weighted average credit rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio as rated by standard poor s corporation was aa at december  while the investment grade rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio addresses credit risk  it does not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
at december   approximately of the company s total invested assets were comprised of corporate fixed maturity securities 
eighty seven percent of the company s corporate fixed maturity portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities are distributed among the various rating categories as follows aaa  aa  a  and bbb 
corporate fixed maturity securities subject the company to credit risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk 
to reduce its exposure to corporate credit risk  the company diversifies its investments across economic sectors  industry classes and issuers 
mortgage backed securities comprised of the company s total invested assets at december  ninety eight percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
the company  through its insurance subsidiaries  maintains a program in which investments are financed using advances from various federal home loan banks 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the investments purchased with those funds 
at december   the company had outstanding advances of million 
the advances were obtained at a fixed rate and have a weighted average term to maturity of years 
a total of million of these advances will mature at various times during during  million of federal home loan bank advances matured and were repaid and million of advances were obtained by the company 
in addition  the company has from time to time utilized reverse repurchase agreements  futures and option contracts and interest rate and credit default swaps in connection with its investment strategy 
these transactions may require the company to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral 
as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes  the company may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to it 
the company also maintains a securities lending program under which certain securities from its portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
the company maintains full ownership rights to the securities loaned and continues to earn interest and dividends on them 
the collateral received for securities loaned is recorded at the fair value of the collateral  which is generally in an amount in excess of the market value of the securities loaned 
the company s institutional lending agent monitors the market value of the securities loaned and obtains additional collateral as necessary 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the types and amounts of investments made by the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility also contains limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management and market risk 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products and the discount rate used to calculate reserves on the company s other products 
in its asset liability matching process  the company determines and monitors on a quarterly basis the duration of its insurance liabilities in the aggregate and the duration of the investment portfolio supporting such liabilities in order to ensure that the difference between such durations  or the duration gap  remains below an internally specified maximum  and similarly determines and monitors the duration gap as between its interest sensitive liabilities  substantially all of which consist of its asset accumulation products  and the components of its investment portfolio supporting such liabilities in relation to a separate internally specified maximum 
as of december   the company maintained these duration gaps within the aforementioned maximums 
in addition  the company  at times  has utilized futures and option contracts and interest rate or credit default swaps agreements to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of its fixed maturity portfolio 
at december   the company had no material outstanding futures or option contracts or interest rate or credit default swap agreements 
the company  at times  may also invest in non dollar denominated fixed maturity securities that expose it to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  and therefore  may hedge such exposure by using currency forward contracts 
the company s investment in non dollar denominated fixed maturity securities during was less than of total invested assets 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
these analyses enable the company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest rate sensitive financial instruments due to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on these analyses  if interest rates were to immediately increase by from their year end levels  the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets  net of corresponding changes in the fair value of cost of business acquired and insurance and investment related liabilities  would decline by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  these analyses incorporate numerous assumptions and estimates and assume no changes in the composition of the company s investment portfolio in reaction to such interest rate changes 
consequently  the results of this analysis will likely be materially different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios 
the company manages the composition of its borrowed capital by considering factors such as the ratio of borrowed capital to total capital  future debt requirements  the interest rate environment and other market conditions 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt which matures in as compared to an increase of million at december  because interest expense on the company s floating rate corporate debt that was outstanding at december  would have fluctuated as prevailing interest rates changed  changes in market interest rates would not have materially affected its fair value 
reinsurance 
the company cedes portions of the risks relating to its group employee benefit products under indemnity reinsurance agreements with various unaffiliated reinsurers 
the company pays reinsurance premiums generally based upon percentages of the company s premiums on the business reinsured 
these agreements expire at various intervals as to new risks  and replacement agreements are negotiated on terms believed appropriate in light of current market conditions 
during  the company replaced certain of its existing reinsurance arrangements for its excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
under the replacement arrangements for excess workers compensation products  the company reinsures excess workers compensation risks between million compared to million previously and million  and a majority in proportionate amount of the risks between million and million  per policy per occurrence 
for long term disability products effective october  for new policies and  for existing policies  the earlier of the next policy anniversary date or october  the company reinsures risks in excess of  compared to  previously in benefits per individual per month 
these changes have reduced the reinsurance premiums paid by the company for these products 
however  in the case of long term disability products  management does not believe that this reduction is sufficient to compensate for the anticipated level of losses in the  to  layer of monthly benefits for which the company retains the risk under the new reinsurance arrangement 
the company has implemented a variety of initiatives  including pricing and underwriting initiatives  for these products  however  there can be no assurance that such initiatives will be successful 
if such initiatives are not successful  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
see forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results 
rslic performance contingent options 
in april  the company granted performance contingent incentive options to purchase  shares of the company s class a common stock to each of the seven members of executive management of rslic  for a total of  options  subject to approval by the company s stockholders at the annual meeting of the proposed increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the company s option plan under which the options were granted by  shares 
this approval has been received 
the options  which have a ten year term and whose exercise price equals the fair market value of a share of such stock as determined in accordance with the company option plan under which the options were granted on the grant date  will become exercisable only to the extent that rslic texas  rslic s parent company  meets specified cumulative financial performance targets for the three or five fiscal year periods beginning with the current year  otherwise  such options will be forfeited 
these targets  as described below  generally require that rslic texas s aggregate consolidated pre tax operating income  as defined and computed under each of the related option agreements ptoi  increases during these periods at an annual average rate of over for any of the options to become exercisable  and at an annual average rate of at least for the options to become fully exercisable 
 of each executive s options will become exercisable if rslic texas s ptoi  for the three year performance period is at least million  otherwise  a reduced number of such options will become exercisable to the extent that ptoi for such period exceeds million  determined by interpolating between zero and  according to where the ptoi amount falls in the range between million and million 
 of each executive s options minus the number of any options that become exercisable for the three year performance period will become exercisable if rslic texas s aggregate ptoi for the five year performance period is at least million  otherwise  a reduced number of such options will become exercisable to the extent that ptoi for such period exceeds million  determined by interpolating between zero and  according to where the ptoi amount falls in the range between million and million 
under the option agreements  the formula for determining ptoi incorporates certain adjustments in order to focus on the performance of rslic texas s insurance operations  in particular  the formula excludes realized investment gains and losses 
accordingly  the ptoi amounts that would result in the applicable financial performance targets being met will not be the same as rslic texas s income before income tax expense  calculated in accordance with gaap  for the relevant periods 
the company believes that these options will provide substantial incentives for these executives to contribute toward rslic texas s attaining the specified targets  thereby enhancing the company s financial performance  however  no assurance can be given that such results will be achieved 
during the second quarter of  the company began recognizing compensation expense for these options under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
over the performance period 
the compensation expense associated with these options will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
management s judgment is most critical in the estimation of its liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses and its assets for cost of business acquired and in the valuation of its investments 
a discussion of how management applies these critical accounting policies follows 
future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the company establishes reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to its insurance products 
these reserves  which totaled  million at december   represent management s best estimate of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the reserves are calculated using various generally recognized actuarial methodologies and are based upon assumptions that management believes are appropriate and which vary by type of product 
annually  external actuarial experts also review the company s methodologies  assumptions and the resulting reserves 
the company s projected ultimate insurance liabilities and associated reserves are estimates  which are subject to variability 
this variability arises because the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
the estimation process is complex and involves information obtained from company specific and industry wide data  as well as general economic information 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for future policy benefits relate to mortality  morbidity  claim termination and discount rates 
the reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are determined on an individual basis for reported claims and estimates of ibnr losses are developed on the basis of past experience 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for unpaid claims and claim expenses are the trend in loss costs  the expected frequency and severity of claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
the assumptions vary based on the year the claim is incurred 
at december   disability and primary and excess workers compensation reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses with a carrying value of million have been discounted at a weighted average rate of  with the rates ranging from to 
disability reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the assets selected to support these liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments 
primary and excess workers compensation claim reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based on the risk free rate of return for us government securities with a duration comparable to the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled 
the rates used to discount reserves are determined annually 
the methods and assumptions used to establish reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are continually reviewed and updated based on current circumstances  and any resulting adjustments are reflected in earnings currently 
there have been no material changes in the actuarial assumptions and or methods from those used in the previous periods 
if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
deferred acquisition costs 
costs related to the acquisition of new insurance business  such as commissions  certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and certain sales office expenses  are deferred when incurred 
the unamortized balance of these deferred acquisition costs is included in cost of business acquired on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs related to group life  disability and accident products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of the total expected premium income 
deferred acquisition costs related to casualty insurance products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the period in which the related premium is earned 
deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from such policies surrender charges and mortality  investment and expense margins 
the amortization is a constant percentage of estimated gross profits based on the ratio of the present value of amounts deferred as compared to the present value of estimated gross profits 
adjustments are made each year to reflect the actual gross profits to date as compared to assumed experience and any changes in the remaining expected future gross profits 
the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs related to certain asset accumulation products is adjusted for the impact on estimated future gross profits as if net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities had been realized at the balance sheet date 
the impact of this adjustment  net of the related income tax expense or benefit  is included in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
deferred acquisition costs are charged to current earnings to the extent that it is determined that future premiums or estimated gross profits will not be adequate to cover the amounts deferred 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts represented  and  respectively  of the total amounts of the deferred acquisition cost balances outstanding at the beginning of the respective periods 
investments 
investments are primarily carried at fair value with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of the related income tax benefit or expense and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired 
ninety eight percent of the company s fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio are actively traded in a liquid market or have other liquidity mechanisms 
securities acquired through private placements  which are not actively traded in a liquid market and do not have other mechanisms for their liquidation  totaled million at december  the company estimates the fair value for these securities primarily by comparison to similar securities with quoted market prices 
if quotes are not available on similar securities  the company estimates fair value based on recent purchases or sales of similar securities or other internally prepared valuations 
key assumptions used in this process include the level of risk free interest rates  risk premiums  and performance of underlying collateral  if applicable 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate these investments in a timely manner  if necessary  may be adversely impacted by the lack of an actively traded market 
historically  the company has not realized amounts on dispositions of non marketable investments that varied materially from the amounts estimated by the company under this valuation methodology 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of these securities  however  had there been an active market for these securities during the applicable reporting period  the market prices may have been materially different than the amounts reported 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
the company evaluates  among other things  the financial position and prospects of the issuer  conditions in the issuer s industry and geographic area  liquidity of the investment  changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment  and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is other than temporary 
the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is lower than its amortized cost and the company s ability and intent to retain the investment to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s fair value are also considered 
in  and  the company recognized losses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for the other than temporary decline in the value of certain securities 
these losses were recognized as a result of events that occurred in the respective periods  such as downgrades in an issuer s credit ratings  deteriorating financial results of issuers  adverse changes in the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows from securities and the impact of the recessionary economic environment on issuers financial positions 
investment grade and non investment grade fixed maturity securities comprised and  respectively  of the company s total investment portfolio at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to non investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized appreciation and depreciation  net of the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  has been reflected on the company s balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company anticipates that if certain existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million pre tax million to million on an after tax basis with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may exceed or be lower than such range 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of the company s procedures for the evaluation of other than temporary impairment in valuation 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
the company also invests in balances with independent investment managers  consisting primarily of investments in limited partnerships which invest in various financial instruments 
these investments are reflected in the company s financial statements under the equity method  accordingly  positive or negative changes in the value of the partnerships underlying investments are included in net investment income 
for this purpose  the company estimates the values of its balances with independent investment managers based on values provided by the managers  as adjusted based on available information concerning the underlying investment portfolios 
as of december   there were no adjustments in such values  as compared with a reduction in value of million as of december  the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the values of its balances with independent investment managers  however  there can be no assurance that such values will ultimately be realized upon liquidation of such balances 
forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results in connection with  and because it desires to take advantage of  the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company cautions readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the above management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k and in any other statement made by  or on behalf of  the company  whether in future filings with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise 
forward looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations  strategies  financial results  prospects  outlooks or other developments 
some forward looking statements may be identified by the use of terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends  judgment or other similar expressions 
forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control and many of which  with respect to future business decisions  are subject to change 
examples of such uncertainties and contingencies include  among other important factors  those affecting the insurance industry generally  such as the economic and interest rate environment  federal and state legislative and regulatory developments  including but not limited to changes in financial services  employee benefit and tax laws and regulations  market pricing and competitive trends relating to insurance products and services  acts of terrorism or war  and the availability and cost of reinsurance  and those relating specifically to the company s business  such as the level of its insurance premiums and fee income  the claims experience  persistency and other factors affecting the profitability of its insurance products  the performance of its investment portfolio and changes in the company s investment strategy  acquisitions of companies or blocks of business  and ratings by major rating organizations of the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
certain of these uncertainties and contingencies are described in more detail in the remainder of this section 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking information 
reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate 
the company s reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimates 
see critical accounting policies future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses for a description of the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process 
these estimates are subject to variability  since the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
moreover  under the actuarial methodologies discussed previously  these estimates are subject to reevaluation based on developing trends with respect to the company s loss experience 
such trends may emerge over longer periods of time  and changes in such trends cannot necessarily be identified or predicted at any given time by reference to current claims experience  whether favorable or unfavorable 
if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the market values of the company s investments fluctuate 
the market values of the company s investments vary depending on economic and market conditions  including interest rates  and such values can decline as a result of changes in such conditions 
increasing interest rates or a widening in the spread between interest rates available on us treasury securities and corporate debt  for example  will typically have an adverse impact on the market values of the fixed maturity securities in the company s investment portfolio 
if interest rates decline  the company generally achieves a lower overall rate of return on investments of cash generated from the company s operations 
in addition  in the event that investments are called or mature in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates 
the company may also in the future be required or determine to sell certain investments at a price and a time when the market value of such investments is less than the book value of such investments 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
see critical accounting policies investments for a description of management s evaluation process 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience losses from other than temporary declines in security values 
such losses are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement 
see results of operations compared to the company s investment strategy exposes the company to default and other risks 
the management of the company s investment portfolio is an important component of the company s profitability since a substantial portion of the company s operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and  in the case of asset accumulation products  the interest credited on policyholder funds and  in the case of the company s other products for which reserves are discounted  the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
see liquidity and capital resources investments for a description of the company s investment portfolio and strategy 
the company is subject to the risk  among others  that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities the company owns will default on principal and interest payments 
a major economic downturn or any of the various other factors that affect issuers abilities to pay could result in issuer defaults 
because the company s investments consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and short term investments  such defaults could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
the company s financial position exposes the company to interest rate risks 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products 
see liquidity and capital resources asset liability management and market risk 
profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company manages this risk by adjusting the prices charged for these products 
the company s ability to reduce its exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the company transfers its exposure to some risks through reinsurance arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
under the company s reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
at december  and  the company had reinsurance receivables of million and million  respectively 
the availability  amount  cost and terms of reinsurance may vary significantly based on market conditions 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance will increase the company s risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will  absent a decrease in the reinsurance amount  reduce the company s premium income 
in either case  the company s operating results could be adversely affected unless it is able to accordingly adjust the prices or other terms of its insurance policies or successfully implement other operational initiatives  as to which no assurance can be given 
furthermore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurance 
the company obtains reinsurance primarily through indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the company is still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurers fail to meet their financial obligations 
such failures could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
some reinsurers experienced significant losses related to the terrorist events of september  as a result of this and other market factors  higher prices and less favorable terms and conditions are presently being offered in the reinsurance market 
these market conditions are reflected in the terms of the replacement reinsurance arrangements entered into during for the company s excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
see liquidity and capital resources reinsurance 
in the future  the company s reinsurers may continue to seek price increases  although the extent of any such increases cannot currently be predicted 
also  there has been significantly reduced availability of reinsurance covering risks such as terrorist and catastrophic events 
accordingly  substantially all of the company s coverages of this nature were discontinued during  which would result in the company retaining a higher portion of losses from such events if they occur 
the company has not been able to replace such coverages on acceptable terms due to present market conditions  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
however  under the terrorism act  which terminates on december   the federal government will pay of the company s covered losses relating to acts of international terrorism from property and casualty products directly written by sncc above the company s annual deductible 
see business group employee benefit products 
the occurrence of a significant catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the insurance business is a heavily regulated industry 
the company s insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the other states in which they conduct business 
such regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by such subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments such subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries businesses  including  for example  rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products  claims handling practices and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states 
in april  the new york attorney general nyag initiated an investigation into certain insurance broker compensation arrangements and other aspects of dealings between insurance brokers and insurance companies  and  in connection therewith  filed a civil complaint in october against a major insurance brokerage firm based on certain of such firm s compensation arrangements with insurers and alleged misconduct in connection with the placement of insurance business 
other state regulators subsequently announced the commencement of similar investigations and reviews 
the company has received administrative subpoenas or similar requests for information from the illinois division of insurance  the missouri department of insurance  the nyag s office and the north carolina department of insurance in connection with their investigations 
the company anticipates that additional regulatory inquiries may be received by its insurance subsidiaries as the various investigations continue 
the company will fully cooperate with inquiries it has received to date  as well as any future inquiries of this type 
as previously disclosed  based on an internal review relating to the company s insurance subsidiaries  the company has identified certain potential issues concerning past insurance solicitation practices involving sncc and marsh mclennan 
the instances that the company has been able to specifically identify in this regard are limited in number and involved modest amounts of premium 
the company has reported on these issues to the nyag s office and to the missouri department of insurance  and will fully cooperate with these and any other regulatory agencies relating to these issues 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of this matter on the company or of the various investigations  or any regulatory changes or litigation resulting from such investigations  on the insurance industry or on the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
from time to time  increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework  and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter  and in many cases increase  state authority to regulate insurance companies 
in addition to legislative initiatives of this type  the naic and insurance regulators are continuously involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
furthermore  while the federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal legislation and administrative policies and court interpretations thereof in a number of areas  such as employee benefits regulation  age  sex and disability based discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly affect the insurance business 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on the operations of the company and those of its insurance subsidiaries 
the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater assets  higher ratings from rating agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger agency sales operations than the company 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from the expanding number of banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives 
the company may be adversely impacted by a decline in the ratings of its insurance subsidiaries or its own credit ratings 
ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor impacting the competitive position of insurance companies 
the financial strength ratings of rslic as of february as rated by am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s were a excellent  a strong  a good and a strong  respectively 
the financial strength ratings of sncc as of february as rated by am best  fitch and standard poor s were a excellent  a strong  and a strong  respectively 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings of companies periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained or improved in the future 
claims paying and financial strength ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
downgrades in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of their products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations 
in addition  downgrades in the company s credit ratings could materially adversely affect its ability to access the capital markets 
the company s senior unsecured debt ratings as of february from am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s were bbb  bbb  baa and bbb  respectively
