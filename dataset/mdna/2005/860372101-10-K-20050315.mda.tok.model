item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
title the title segment includes the functions of searching  examining  closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property 
examination and closing 
the purpose of a title examination is to ascertain the ownership of the property being transferred  debts that are owed on it and the scope of the title policy coverage 
this involves searching for and examining documents such as deeds  mortgages  wills  divorce decrees  court judgments  liens  paving assessments and tax records 
at the closing or settlement  the seller executes and delivers a deed to the new owner 
the buyer typically signs new mortgage documents 
closing funds are then disbursed to the seller  the prior mortgage company  real estate brokers  the title company and others 
the documents are then recorded in the public records 
a title policy is generally issued to both the lender and the new owner 
title policies 
lenders in the united states generally require title insurance as a condition to making a loan on real estate  including securitized lending 
this is to assure lenders of the priority of their lien position 
the purchasers of the property want insurance against claims that may arise against the ownership of the property 
the face amount of the policy is normally the purchase price or the amount of the related loan 
title insurance is substantially different from other types of insurance 
fire  auto  health and life insurance protect against future losses and events 
in contrast  title insurance seeks to eliminate most risks through the examination and settlement process 
investments 
our title insurers maintain investments in accordance with certain statutory requirements for the funding of statutory premium reserves and state deposits 
we have established policies and procedures to minimize our exposure to changes in the fair values of our investments 
these policies include retaining an investment advisory firm  an emphasis upon credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates  and actively managing profile and security mix based upon market conditions 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale 
losses 
losses on policies primarily occur because of a title defect not discovered during the examination and settlement process 
other reasons for losses include forgeries  misrepresentations  unrecorded construction liens  the failure to pay off existing liens  mishandling of settlement funds  issuance by agencies of unauthorized coverages and other legal issues 
some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits 
those claims are based on various legal theories usually alleging misrepresentation by an agency 
although we vigorously defend against spurious claims  we have from time to time incurred a loss in excess of policy limits 

table of contents experience shows that most claims against policies and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued  although claims may be made many years later 
by their nature  claims are often complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims 
estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims  the length of time over which claims are paid  the significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors 
our liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and other losses expected to be reported in the future 
the amount of our loss reserve represents the aggregate future payments  net of recoveries  that we expect to incur on policy and escrow losses and in costs to settle claims 
provisions are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized 
the amounts provided are based on reported claims  historical loss experience  title industry averages  current legal environment and types of policies written 
amounts shown as our estimated liability for future loss payments are continually reviewed by us for reasonableness and adjusted as appropriate 
independent actuaries also reviewed the adequacy of the liability amounts on an annual basis and found our reserves adequate at each year end 
in accordance with industry practice  the amounts have not been discounted to their present values 
factors affecting revenues 
title revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate markets we serve and the prices at which real estate sales are made 
real estate sales are directly affected by the availability and cost of money to finance purchases 
other factors include demand by buyers  consumer confidence and family incomes 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
generally  the third quarter is the most active in terms of real estate sales and the first quarter is the least active 
in addition  when interest rates decline  the number of refinancing transactions and associated revenues generally increase 
selected information for the national real estate industry follows amounts are preliminary new home sales in millions existing home sales in millions existing home resales median sales price in thousands customers 
the primary sources of title business are attorneys  builders  developers  lenders and real estate brokers 
no one customer was responsible for as much as ten percent of our title operating revenues in any of the last three years 
titles insured include residential and commercial properties  undeveloped acreage  farms  ranches and water rights 
service  location  financial strength  size and related factors affect customer acceptance 
increasing market share is accomplished primarily by providing superior service 
the parties to a closing are concerned with personal schedules and the interest and other costs associated with any delays in the settlement 
the rates charged to customers are regulated  to varying degrees  by different states 
financial strength and stability of the title underwriter are important factors in maintaining and increasing our agency network 
among the nation s top four title insurers  we earned one of the highest ratings awarded by the title industry s leading rating companies 
our principal underwriter  stewart title guaranty company guaranty is currently rated a by demotech  inc  a by fitch  a by lace financial  a by moody s and a by standard poor s 
market share 
title insurance statistics are compiled quarterly by the title industry s national association 
based on unconsolidated statutory net premiums written through september   guaranty is one of the leading title insurers in america 
our principal competitors include fidelity national financial  inc  the first american corporation and landamerica financial group  inc like most title insurers  we also compete with abstractors  attorneys who issue title opinions and attorney owned title insurance bar funds 
we also compete with issuers of alternative title insurance products  which typically provide more limited coverage and less service for a smaller premium 
a number of homebuilders  financial institutions  real estate brokers and others own or control title insurance agencies  some of which issue policies underwritten by guaranty 
this controlled business also provides competition for our agencies 

table of contents title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title operating revenues for the last three years were amounts millions percentages california texas florida new york all others offices 
at december   we had  policy issuing offices and agencies  compared with  a year earlier and  two years earlier 
of these totals   and  were independent agencies at december   and  respectively 
regulations 
title insurance companies are subject to comprehensive state regulations covering premium rates  agency licensing  policy forms  trade practices  reserve requirements  investments and the flow of funds between an insurer and its parent or its subsidiaries and any similar related party transactions 
kickbacks and similar practices are prohibited by various state and federal laws 
real estate information the real estate information segment primarily provides electronic delivery of data  products and services related to real estate 
our services related to the mortgage origination process include flood certificates  credit reports  traditional and automated property valuations  electronic mortgage documents  property information reports and tax services 
we also provide post closing outsourcing services for residential mortgage lenders  including document review  investor delivery  fha va insuring  document retrieval  preparation and recordation of assignments  lien releases and security interests  collateral reviews and loan pool certifications 
in addition  we provide diverse products and services related to irc section tax deferred exchanges  automated mapping projects and geodetic positioning  real estate database conversion  construction  maintenance and access  automation for government recording and registration  and criminal  credit and motor vehicle background checks and pre employment screening services 
factors affecting revenues 
as in the title segment  rei revenues  particularly those generated by mortgage information services and tax deferred exchanges  are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market 
revenues related to many services are generated on a project basis 
contracts for automating government recording and registration and mapping projects are often awarded after a lengthy bid process 
our principal competitors vary across the wide range of services 
in the mortgage related products and services area  competitors include the major title underwriters mentioned under title market share  as well as entities known as vendor management companies 
another important factor affecting revenues is the advancement of our technological ability to provide our customers with easy access to and use of reliable and complete real estate information 
customers 
the primary sources of our rei business are residential mortgage lenders and servicers 
our timeliness and accuracy in providing services are critical to our customers since these factors directly affect the service they provide to their customers  primarily borrowers 
delays and errors directly impact the cost of originating or servicing the loan or the value of the loan asset 
our other customers include title agencies  county clerks and recorders  municipalities  real estate professionals and attorneys 
our financial strength  marketplace presence and reputation as a technology innovator are important factors in attracting new business 
general technology 
our automation products and services are increasing productivity in the title office and speeding the real estate closing process for lenders  real estate professionals and consumers 
before automation  an order typically required several individuals to search the title  retrieve and review documents and create the title policy commitment 
today  on a normal subdivision file  one person can receive the order electronically and  on the same computer screen  view the prior file  examine the index of documents  retrieve and review electronically stored documents  prepare the title policy commitment and deliver the finished product 

table of contents trademarks 
we have developed numerous automation products and processes that are crucial to both our title and rei segments 
these systems automate most facets of the real estate transaction 
among these trademarked products and processes are aim  e title  globexplorer  landata title office  reimall  sureclose  titlelogix and virtual underwriter 
we consider these trademarks  which are perpetual in duration  to be important to our business

table of contents item legal proceedings as previously reported in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   stewart title insurance company stic  an underwriter subsidiary of the company  was a defendant in a new york state class action lawsuit in the supreme court state of new york 
the lawsuit alleges that stic directly and through its agencies routinely collected excess premiums in connection with refinance transactions 
similar actions were brought against seven other underwriters 
stic denied culpability on a number of grounds 
in february  stic reached a settlement with the plaintiffs  subject to approval by the court  which would fully and finally resolve all purposed claims of the plaintiffs 
at december   the company had a reserve of million for this claim and believes that its reserve is sufficient to cover any further significant losses as a result of this lawsuit 
we are party to a number of lawsuits incurred in connection with our business  most of which are of a routine nature involving disputed policy claims 
in many of these suits  the plaintiff seeks exemplary or treble damages in excess of policy limits based on the alleged malfeasance of an issuing agency 
we do not expect that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

table of contents p a r t ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange the nyse under the symbol stc

high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we paid regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock from through during  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
the board also determined that our regular quarterly dividend should be discontinued in favor of returning those and additional funds to stockholders through the stock repurchase plan 
under this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock during and none in through an additional  shares of treasury stock were acquired primarily in the second quarter of the majority of these shares were acquired as a result of the consolidation of a majority owned subsidiary that was previously held as an equity investee 
all of these shares were held by us as treasury shares at december  no cash dividends were paid from until december in response to favorable tax law changes  the board of directors declared an annual cash dividend of per share  payable december  and december  to common stockholders of record on december  and december   respectively

table of contents item selected financial data ten year summary the following table sets forth  for the periods and at the dates indicated  our selected consolidated financial data

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview 
we reported net earnings of million for the year ended december   compared with net earnings of million for the same period in on a diluted per share basis  net earnings were for the year  compared with net earnings of per diluted share for the year revenues for the year decreased to  million from  million last year 
operating profit margins decreased year over year primarily due to the fixed nature of most of our operating costs 
margins were also reduced due to our investments in growth  technology and new services 
excluding title agency retentions  employee costs are the largest component of stewart s operating costs 
consistent with our strategy of balancing employee costs with our business volume over the long term  employee costs and order counts are continually monitored 
we work to balance staffing with customer service needs using scalable technology to allow for continued growth 
also  we continue to emphasize growing our higher margin commercial business  executing accretive acquisitions and expanding internationally 
stewart believes these strategies will position it for future growth  diversification and strength 
critical accounting estimates 
actual results can differ from the accounting estimates we report 
however  we believe there is no material risk of a change in our estimates that is likely to have a material impact on our reported financial condition or operating performance for the three years ended december  title loss reserves 
our most critical accounting estimate is providing for title loss reserves 
our liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and claims expected to be reported in the future 
the amount of the reserve represents the aggregate future payments  net of recoveries  that we expect to incur on policy and escrow losses and in costs to settle claims 
we base our estimates on reported claims  historical loss experience  title industry averages and the current legal and economic environment 
in making estimates  we use moving average ratios of recent actual policy loss payment experience  net of recoveries  to premium revenues 
provisions for title losses  as a percentage of title operating revenues  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a change of in this percentage would have changed the provision for title losses and pretax earnings by approximately million for the year ended december  estimating future loss payments is difficult and our assumptions are subject to the risk of change 
claims  by their very nature  are complex and involve uncertainties as to the dollar amount and timing of individual payments 
claims are often paid up to years or more after the policy is issued 
we have consistently followed the same basic method of estimating loss payments for more than ten years 
third party consulting actuaries have reviewed and found our title loss reserves to be adequate at each year end for more than nine years 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
based on events that may indicate impairment of title plants and other long lived assets  and our annual june th evaluation of goodwill  we estimate and expense any loss in value to our current operations 
the process of determining impairment relies on projections of future cash flows  operating results and market conditions 
uncertainties exist in these projections and bear the risk of change related to factors such as interest rates and overall real estate markets 
actual market conditions and operating results may vary materially from our projections 
there were no impairment write offs of goodwill during the years ended december  and during   of goodwill attributed to a subsidiary held for sale was written off and is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
we use third party appraisers to assist us in determining the fair value of our reporting units and assessing whether an impairment of goodwill exists 
policy issuing agency revenues 
we recognize premium revenues on title insurance policies written by independent agencies when the policies are reported to us 
in addition  because of the time lag between the closing of an insured real estate transaction and the time the policy is reported to us  we also accrue for unreported policies policies issued prior to period end  but not reported to the underwriter until after period end where reasonable estimates can be made 
we believe that reasonable estimates can be made when recent and consistent policy issuance information is available 
our estimates are based on historical reporting patterns and other information about our agencies 
we also use current trends in our direct operations and in the title industry 
in this accrual  we are not estimating future transactions 
we are estimating policies that have already been issued but not yet received by us 
we have consistently followed the same basic method of estimating unreported policies for more than ten years 
what we do 
our primary business is title insurance and settlement related services 
we close transactions and issue title policies on homes  commercial properties and other real property located in all states  the district of columbia and a number of foreign countries through more than  policy issuing offices and agencies 
we also sell electronically 
table of contents delivered real estate services and information  as well as mapping products and geographic information systems  to domestic and foreign governments and private entities 
our current levels of non usa operations are immaterial with respect to our consolidated financial results 
our business has two main segments title insurance related services and real estate information rei 
these segments are closely related due to the nature of their operations and common customers 
factors affecting revenues 
the principal factors that contribute to increases in our operating revenues for our title and rei segments include declining mortgage interest rates  which usually increase home sales and refinancing transactions  rising home prices  higher premium rates  number of households  increased market share  opening of new offices and acquisitions  and a higher ratio of commercial transactions that  although fewer in number  typically yield higher premiums 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
results of operations a comparison of the results of operations of the company for with and with follows 
factors contributing to fluctuations in results of operations are presented in their order of monetary significance 
we have quantified  when necessary  significant changes 
operating environment 
a table of selected published industry residential data for the years ended december   and follows 
the amounts shown for are preliminary and subject to revision 
the amounts below may not relate directly to or provide accurate data for forecasting our operating revenues or order counts 
mortgage rates year  fixed rate average for the year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter mortgage originations in billions refinancings share new home sales in thousands existing home sales in thousands as shown above  interest rates declined for five consecutive quarters  beginning in the second quarter of through the second quarter of then  rates increased significantly by basis points to 
mortgage originations fell to lower levels beginning in the fourth quarter of  primarily because refinancing transactions fell dramatically 
sales of new and existing homes continued an upward trend 
the company s order levels also began to decline in the third quarter of  largely because of the increase in interest rates 
they remained below prior year levels through august for the rest of  orders exceeded the number of orders received in some of this increase was due to acquisitions 
our order counts follow in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter most industry experts project mortgage interest rates to rise slightly in due to the large number of refinancings completed in and  significantly fewer refinancing transactions are being forecast for 
table of contents title revenues 
our revenues from direct operations decreased in and increased in acquisitions added revenues of million and million in and  respectively 
the number of direct closings we handled decreased in and increased in the largest revenue decreases in were in texas  colorado and illinois  offset by increases in new york  canada  california and puerto rico 
the largest increases in were in california  texas  canada and washington 
direct closings relate only to files closed by our underwriters and subsidiaries and do not include closings by independent agencies 
the average revenue per closing increased in due to a lower ratio of refinancings closed by our direct operations compared to the prior year 
the average revenue per closing increased in title insurance premiums on refinancings are typically less than on property sales 
the increase in average revenue per closing was also due to an increased proportion of commercial transactions and rising home prices 
premium revenues from independent agencies decreased in and increased in the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in refinancing transactions offset somewhat by an increase in property sales 
we are unable to quantify the relative contributions from refinancings and property sales because  in most jurisdictions  our independent agencies are not required to report this information 
our statements on sales and refinancings are based on published industry data from sources such as the mortgage bankers association  the national association of realtors  fannie mae and freddie mac 
we also use information from our direct operations 
the largest decreases in in premium revenues from independent agencies were primarily in california  utah  new york and michigan  offset partially by increases in virginia  florida and pennsylvania 
the increases in were primarily due to the increases in both refinancings and property sales 
the largest increases in were in california  new york and florida 
the texas department of insurance reduced title insurance premium rates by effective july  the impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations of this rate decrease was immaterial 
title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title operating revenues for the last three years were as follows amounts millions percentages california texas florida new york all others rei revenues 
real estate information revenues were million in  million in and million in the decrease in resulted primarily from a lesser amount of post closing services and electronic mortgage documents resulting from a reduction in the volume of real estate transactions  offset somewhat by an increase in section property exchange services 
the increase in resulted primarily from providing a greater number of post closing services  electronic mortgage documents and section property exchange services resulting from the large volume of real estate transactions 
investments 
investment income increased in because of increases in average balances invested  partially offset by lower yields 
investment income decreased in because of lower yields  partially offset by increases in average balances invested 
certain investment gains in  and were realized as part of the ongoing management of the investment portfolio for the purpose of improving performance 
agency retention 
the amounts retained by agencies  as a percentage of revenues from agency operations  were  and in the years  and  respectively 
amounts retained by title agencies are based on agreements between agencies and our title underwriters 
the percentage that amounts retained by agencies bears to agency revenues may vary from year to year because of the geographical mix of agency operations and the volume of title revenues 

table of contents selected cost ratios by segment 
the following table shows employee costs and other operating expenses as a percentage of related title and real estate information operating revenues for the last three years 
employee costs other operating title rei these two categories of expenses are discussed below in terms of year to year monetary changes 
employee costs 
employee costs for the combined business segments increased in and in the number of persons we employed at december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in staff in was primarily due to employees  and million in employee costs  from acquisitions 
the increase in staff in was primarily due to increased title and rei volume and acquisitions 
in our rei segment  employee costs remained flat in but increased in primarily because we provided more post closing services to lenders 
these services are considerably more labor intensive than other rei services 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the combined business segments increased in and in the increase in other operating expenses in was primarily from acquisitions and new offices  which contributed approximately million of the increase 
other increases were in litigation costs of million  rent and technology costs 
the increases were partially offset by decreases in certain rei expenses in response to volume decreases  supplies expense and attorney fees 
the increase in other operating expenses in was primarily due to acquisitions and new offices  search fees  premium taxes and business promotion 
other operating expenses also includes title plant expenses 
most of our operating expenses follow  to varying degrees  the changes in transaction volume and revenues 
our employee costs and certain other operating expenses are sensitive to inflation 
to the extent inflation causes increases in the prices of homes and other real estate  premium revenues also increase 
premiums are determined in part by the insured values of the transactions we handle 
title losses 
provisions for title losses  as a percentage of title operating revenues  were  and in  and  respectively 
an increase in loss payment experience for prior policy years resulted in an increase in our loss ratio in income taxes 
the provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes represented effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
contractual obligations 
our material contractual obligations at december  were payments due millions less than more than year years years years total notes payable operating leases estimated title losses material contractual obligations consist mainly of notes payable  operating leases and title losses 
all operating leases are for office space and expire over the next years 
future loss reserve payments are shown in total because we cannot accurately estimate the time period in which losses may be paid because claims  by their nature  are complex and incurred and paid over long periods of time 
loss reserves represent a total estimate only  whereas the other contractual obligations are determinable as to timing and amounts 
title losses paid were million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
cash provided by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has been the primary source of financing for additions to property and equipment  expanding operations  dividends to stockholders and other requirements 
this source may be supplemented by bank borrowings 
the most significant non operating sources of cash were from proceeds of investments matured and sold in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we used cash for the purchases of investments in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a substantial majority of our consolidated cash and investments at december  was held by stewart title guaranty company guaranty and its subsidiaries 
the use and investment of these funds  dividends to the company and cash transfers between guaranty and its subsidiaries and the company are subject to certain legal restrictions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
our liquidity at december   excluding guaranty and its subsidiaries  was comprised of cash and investments aggregating million and short term liabilities of million 
we know of no commitments or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our ability to fund cash needs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our loss reserves are fully funded  segregated and invested in high quality securities and short term investments 
this is required by the insurance regulators of the states in which our underwriters are domiciled 
at december   these investments aggregated million and our estimated title loss reserves were million 
historically  our operating cash flow has been sufficient to pay all title policy losses incurred 
as reported in note  the market value of our debt securities maturing in less than one year was million at december  combined with our annual cash flow from operations million in  we do not expect future loss payments to create a liquidity problem for us 
beyond providing funds for losses  we manage the maturities of our investment portfolio to provide safety of capital  improve earnings and mitigate interest rate risks 
acquisitions during  and resulted in additions to goodwill of million  million and million  respectively 
we consider our capital resources to be adequate 
we expect external capital resources would be available  if needed  because of our low debt to equity ratio  in which long term debt is million and stockholders equity is million at december  we are not aware of any trends  either favorable or unfavorable  that would materially affect notes payable or stockholders equity 
we do not expect any material changes in the cost of such resources 
significant acquisitions in the future could materially affect the notes payable or stockholders equity balances 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any material source of liquidity or financing that involves off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the discussion below about our risk management strategies includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
management s projections of hypothetical net losses in the fair value of our market rate sensitive financial instruments  should certain potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
while we believe that the potential market rate changes are possible  actual rate changes could differ 
our only material market risk in investments in financial instruments is our debt securities portfolio 
we invest primarily in marketable municipal  corporate  foreign  us government and mortgage backed debt securities 
we do not invest in financial instruments of a hedging or derivative nature 
we have established policies and procedures to minimize our exposure to changes in the fair values of our investments 
these policies include retaining an investment advisory firm  an emphasis upon credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
debt securities at december  mature  according to their contractual terms  as follows actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized market cost value thousands in one year or less after one year through two years after two years through three years after three years through four years after four years through five years after five years mortgage backed securities we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and do not expect any material loss to result from the failure to perform by issuers of the debt securities we hold 
our investments are not collateralized 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by us government agencies 
based on our debt securities portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease increase of approximately million  or  in the fair value of our portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would only be realized upon the sale of the investments 
any other than temporary declines in market values of securities are charged to earnings
