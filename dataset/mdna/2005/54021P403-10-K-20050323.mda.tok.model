item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the discussion below in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
also  the discussion which follows contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below under factors which may affect future results 
executive summary we are one of the largest independent owners and operators of full service hotels in the united states in terms of our number of guest rooms  as reported by hotel business in the green book issue published in december we are considered an independent owner and operator because we do not operate our hotels under our own name 
we operate substantially all of our hotels under nationally recognized brands  such as crowne plaza  holiday inn  marriott and hilton 
as of march   we operated hotels with an aggregate of  rooms  located in states and canada 
of the hotels we operated as of march   hotels  with an aggregate of  rooms  are part of our continuing operations  while eight hotels  with an aggregate of  rooms  are held for sale 
three of the eight hotels  with an aggregate of rooms  were classified as held for sale in january and are  therefore  included in continuing operations at december  our portfolio of hotels consists of hotels that we wholly own and operate through subsidiaries  four hotels that we operate in joint ventures in which we have a or greater equity interest and exercise control  and one hotel that we operate in a joint venture in which we have a non controlling equity interest 
we consolidate all of these entities in our financial statements  other than the one entity in which we hold a non controlling equity interest and for which we account under the equity method 
on december   due to a number of factors  including our heavy debt load  a lack of available funds to maintain the quality of our hotels  a weakening us economy  and the severe decline in travel in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on september   we filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
at the time of the chapter filing  our portfolio consisted of hotels 
following the effective date of our plan of reorganization  we emerged from chapter with hotels  eight of the hotels having been conveyed to a lender in satisfaction of outstanding debt obligations and one having been returned to the lessor of a capital lease 
of the portfolio of hotels  hotels emerged from chapter on november   hotels emerged from chapter on may  and one hotel never filed under chapter in  we developed a strategy of owning and operating a portfolio of profitable  well maintained and appealing hotels at superior locations in strong markets 
we have implemented this strategy by renovating and repositioning certain of our existing hotels to improve performance  divesting hotels that do not fit this strategy or that are unlikely to do so without significant effort or expense  and acquiring selected hotels that better fit this strategy 

table of contents in accordance with this strategy  and our efforts to reduce debt and interest costs  in we identified hotels  our only office building and three land parcels for sale 
as of march   we sold of these hotels  the office building and two land parcels for an aggregate sales price of million 
of the million aggregate net proceeds from the sale of these assets  we used million to pay down debt and million for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
as a result of these sales  and with the addition of three hotels listed for sale in january  as of march   our portfolio consisted of hotels and one land parcel  of which eight hotels and one land parcel are held for sale 
operating summary below is a summary of our results of operations  presented in more detail in results of operations continuing operations revenues increased in due to improved performance in occupancy and adr 
revenues for were negatively affected by the rooms that were displaced by our renovation program and the impact of two hotels that have been closed since september for hurricane repairs 
direct and other hotel operating expenses increased due to increased revenues and the corresponding increase in variable expenses such as franchise fees that increase with revenues 
additionally  utility costs increased due to usage and rate increases  maintenance and repairs costs increased as we increased our focus on maintaining our hotels  and advertising and promotion costs increased as we focused our marketing efforts on repositioning our hotels 
interest expense increased in primarily due to costs associated with our mortgage refinance  including higher interest expense as we refinanced a significant portion of our debt from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  the deferred loan costs that were written off for the debt that was extinguished  prepayment penalties on the debt was extinguished and the prepayment premium on the preferred stock shares either converted to common stock immediately following the effective date of our equity offering or redeemed in cash on july  additionally  in  while certain hotels were in chapter  we did not pay interest as approved by the bankruptcy court 
during  we analyzed our assets held for use for conditions of impairment and  where appropriate  recorded impairment charges where the carrying values exceeded their estimated fair values 
our analysis included such factors as cash flow  negative demographic or economic factors in each market  increased guest room supply in each market  and vehicular access to our hotels 
during  our financial results were significantly affected by the hurricanes that hit the southeastern united states in august and september 
eight hotels were damaged by the hurricanes 
six of these eight hotels received extensive damage during the hurricane season 
our eleventh and sixteenth highest revenue generating hotels in were severely damaged by two different hurricanes 
these two hotels were closed in september for hurricane renovation and  as of march   these hotels remain closed 
these hotels are expected to reopen in the third quarter of we incurred clean up costs related to these storms  lost revenues and profits  and will incur significant capital to repair these assets 
while we do have business interruption insurance we have not recorded any of the proceeds expected to be realized on these claims in our financial results 
discontinued operations at december   seven hotels and one land parcel were held for sale 
at december   hotels and three land parcels were held for sale 
the combined condensed statement of operations for discontinued operations as of december  includes the results of operations for the seven hotels held for sale and the hotels that were sold in the combined condensed statement of operations for discontinued operations as of december  includes the results of operations for the hotels held for sale  the one hotel and office building that were sold in and the eight wholly owned hotels that were conveyed to the lender in satisfaction of outstanding debt obligations and one wholly owned hotel that was returned to the lessor of a capital lease in january 
table of contents the assets and liabilities related to these held for sale assets are separately disclosed in our consolidated balance sheet 
where the carrying values of the assets held for sale exceeded their estimated fair values  net of selling costs  we reduced the carrying values and recorded impairment charges 
fair values were determined using market prices and where the estimated selling prices  net of selling costs  exceeded the carrying values  no adjustments were recorded 
we classify an asset as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property for sale 
while we believe the completion of these dispositions is probable  the sale of these assets is subject to market conditions and we cannot provide assurance that we will finalize the sale of all or any of these assets on favorable terms or at all 
between november  and march   we sold hotels  our only office building and two land parcels for aggregate net proceeds of million  of which we used million to pay down debt with the balance used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures 
for the assets sold in  the total revenues for the year ended december  were million  the direct operating expenses were million  and the other hotel operating expenses were million 
the results of operations of the other hotels that we consolidate in our consolidated financial statements are reported in continuing operations as of december  the three hotels that were identified for sale in january are included in continuing operations at december  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as we prepare our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation policy all of our hotels are owned by operating subsidiaries 
we consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of those hotels where we own at least of the voting equity interest and we exercise control 
all of the subsidiaries are wholly owned except for five joint ventures  one of which is not consolidated but is accounted for under the equity method 
when we consolidate hotels in which we own less than of the voting equity interest  we include the assets and liabilities of these hotels in our consolidated balance sheet 
the third party interests in the net assets of these hotels are reported as minority interest on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  our consolidated statement of operations reflects the full revenues and expenses of these hotels and the third party portion of the net income or loss is reported as minority interest in our consolidated statements of operations 
if the loss applicable to the minority interest exceeds the minority s equity  we report the entire loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
when we account for an entity under the equity method  we record only our share of the investment on our consolidated balance sheet and our share of the net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we own a non controlling equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture and have included our share of this investment in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
our share of the net income or loss of the unconsolidated joint venture is shown in interest income and other in our consolidated statements of operations 
our investment in this entity at december   was million and our share of the income was  deferral policy we defer franchise application fees on the acquisition or renewal of a franchise as well as loan origination costs related to new or renewed loan financing arrangements 
deferrals relating to the acquisition or renewal of a franchise are amortized on a straight line basis over the period of the franchise agreement 
we amortize deferred financing costs over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the effective interest method incorporates the present values of future cash outflows and the effective yield on 
table of contents the debt in determining the amortization of loan fees 
at december   these deferrals totaled million for our continuing operations hotels 
if we were to write these expenses off in the year of payment  our operating expenses in those years would be significantly higher 
asset impairment we invest significantly in real estate assets 
property  plant and equipment represents of the total assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  accordingly  our policy on asset impairment is considered a critical accounting estimate 
under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
management periodically evaluates the company s property and equipment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that a possible impairment in the carrying values of the assets has occurred 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered for impairment when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by that asset over its estimated useful life is less than the asset s carrying amounts 
in determining the undiscounted cash flows we consider the current operating results  market trends  and future prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value is charged to operating expenses 
we obtain fair values through broker valuations or appraisals 
these broker valuations of fair value normally use the cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key valuation approach  or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
if the projected future cash flow exceeds the asset s carrying values  no adjustment is recorded 
impairment loss for an asset held for sale is recognized when the asset s carrying value is greater than the fair value less estimated selling costs 
see note for further discussion of the company s charges for asset impairment 
as part of this evaluation  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we classify our properties into two categories  assets held for sale and assets held for use 
we consider an asset held for sale when the following criteria per sfas no 
are met management commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  an active marketing plan to sell the asset has been initiated at a reasonable price  the sale of the asset is probable within one year  and it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan to sell the asset will be made 
upon designation of an asset as held for sale  we record the carrying value of the asset at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value which is determined after consultation with our real estate brokers less estimated selling costs  and we cease depreciation of the asset 
the fair values of the assets held for sale are based on the estimated selling prices 
we determine the estimated selling prices in conjunction with our real estate brokers 
the estimated selling costs are based on our experience with similar asset sales 
we record impairment charges and write down respective hotel assets if their carrying values exceed the estimated selling prices less costs to sell 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses on assets held for sale 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses on hotels and land parcels held for sale and million for net book value write offs for held for sale assets that were replaced in that had remaining book value 
with respect to assets held for use  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by these assets 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each hotel with their respective carrying values to determine if there are indicators of impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered for impairment when the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life is less than the asset s carrying value 
if there are indicators of impairment  we determine the estimated fair values of these assets using broker valuations or appraisals 
these broker valuations of fair value normally use the cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key approach or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
if the projected future cash flow exceeds the assets carrying value  no adjustment is recorded 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses  with million on assets held for 
table of contents use and million for net book value write offs for held for use assets that were replaced in that had remaining book value 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses on hotels and million for net book value write offs for held for use assets that were replaced in that had remaining book value 
in connection with our emergence from chapter  and the application of fresh start reporting in which we were required to restate assets to fair values  we recorded a net write down of million on real estate assets during reorganization items in accordance with gaap  income and expenses related to our chapter proceedings were classified as reorganization items while the respective hotels were in chapter we continue to incur expenses as a result of the chapter proceedings but now classify these as corporate and other expenses 
the classification between reorganization items and corporate and other expenses while we were in chapter involved judgment on the part of management 
in addition  as a result of the separation required between continuing operations and discontinued operations  we allocated the reorganization items incurred during the chapter proceedings between continuing and discontinued operations based on the values assigned to the respective properties subsequent to their emergence from chapter accrual of self insured obligations we are self insured up to certain amounts with respect to employee medical  employee dental  property insurance  general liability insurance  personal injury claims  workers compensation  automobile liability and other coverages 
we establish reserves for our estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
our reserves  which are reflected in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  are based on actuarial valuations and our history of claims 
our actuaries incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
trends in actual experience are an important factor in the determination of these estimates 
we believe that our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  however  actual experience in claim frequency and amount could materially differ from our estimates and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and financial condition 
as of december   we had an accrued balance of million for these expenses 
income statement overview on november   in connection with our emergence from chapter and in accordance with gaap  we applied fresh start reporting 
under fresh start reporting  assets and liabilities are restated to reflect their fair values 
as a result  for accounting purposes  our financial statements for periods subsequent to november  are considered to be those of a new reporting entity and are not considered to be comparable with the financial statements for periods on or prior to november  for this reason  we use the term successor when we refer to periods subsequent to november   and the term predecessor when we refer to periods on or prior to november  although we are required to make this distinction under gaap  for purposes of the discussion of results below  we have combined the predecessor s results for the period january  to november   with the successor s results for the period november  to december  and refer to it as the combined period 
the differences between periods due to fresh start reporting are explained where necessary 
the discussion below focuses primarily on our continuing operations 
in the continuing operations discussions  we compare the results of operations for the last three years for consolidated hotels that as of december  are classified as assets held for use 
revenues we categorize our revenues into the following three categories room revenues derived from guest room rentals  food and beverage revenues derived from hotel restaurants  room service  hotel catering and meeting room rentals  and 
table of contents other revenues derived from guests long distance telephone usage  laundry services  parking services  in room movie services  vending machine commissions  leasing of hotel space and other miscellaneous revenues 
transient revenues  which generally account for approximately of room revenues  are revenues derived from individual guests who stay only for brief periods of time without a long term contract 
demand from groups makes up approximately of our room revenues while our contract revenues such as contracts with airlines for crew rooms account for the remaining 
we believe revenues in the hotel industry are best explained by the following three key performance indicators occupancy computed by dividing total room nights sold by the total available room nights  average daily rate adr computed by dividing total room revenues by total room nights sold  and revenue per available room revpar computed by dividing total room revenues by total available room nights 
revpar can also be obtained by multiplying the occupancy by the adr 
to obtain available room nights for a year  we multiply the number of rooms in our portfolio by the number of days in the year 
to obtain available room nights for a hotel sold during the year  we multiply the number of rooms in the hotel by the number of days between january and the date the hotel was sold 
for the two hotels currently closed due to hurricane renovations  we have adjusted available rooms accordingly 
these measures are influenced by a variety of factors including national  regional and local economic conditions  the degree of competition with other hotels in the area and changes in travel patterns 
the demand for accommodations is also affected by normally recurring seasonal patterns and most of our hotels experience lower occupancy levels in the fall and winter months  november through february  which generally results in lower revenues  lower net income and less cash flow during these months 
operating expenses operating expenses fall into the following categories direct expenses these expenses tend to vary with available rooms and occupancy 
however  hotel level expenses contain significant elements of fixed costs and  therefore  do not decline proportionately with revenues 
direct expenses are further categorized as follows room expenses expenses incurred in generating room revenues  food and beverage expenses expenses incurred in generating food and beverage revenues  and other direct expenses expenses incurred in generating the revenue activities classified in other revenues 
other hotel operating expenses these expenses include salaries for hotel management  advertising and promotion  franchise fees  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
property and other taxes  insurance and leases these expenses include equipment  ground and building rentals  insurance  and property  franchise and other taxes 
corporate and other these expenses include corporate salaries and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional fees  directors fees  costs for office space and information technology costs 
also included are expenses relating to post emergence chapter activities 
depreciation and amortization depreciation of fixed assets primarily hotel assets and amortization of deferred franchise fees 
impairment charges charges which were required to write down the carrying values of long term assets to their fair values 

table of contents non operating items non operating items include interest expense  preferred stock dividends  loss on preferred stock redemption and amortization of deferred loan fees  gain on disposal of assets  interest income  our share of the income or loss of our non controlling equity interest in one hotel  for which we account for under the equity method  and minority interests our equity partners share of the income or loss of the four hotels owned by joint ventures that we consolidate 
results of operations continuing operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues continuing operations increase decrease revenues in thousands rooms food and beverage other total revenues occupancy adr revpar the increase in room revenues resulted from increases in occupancy and adr 
occupancy increased and adr increased 
while occupancy increased from  it was negatively impacted by renovations being performed at hotels during  by lost business leading up to the hurricanes that hit the southeastern united states in the third quarter and by the continued closure of two of our hotels crowne plaza west palm beach and holiday inn melbourne as they undergo hurricane renovation work 
excluding the two hotels closed for hurricane renovation and the hotel acquired in december  our room revenue was higher and revpar higher than the same period last year 
for the fourth quarter  continuing operations revpar increased as compared to the same period in excluding the two hotels closed for hurricane renovations and the hotel acquired in december  for the fourth quarter revpar increased as compared to the same period in we made substantial progress on our renovation program in  but with many rooms out of service while under renovation  we experienced substantial room revenue displacement 
the increase in adr results from increasing demand for hotels as the economy improved and the shift away from internet sales that involve more heavily discounted room rates 
as we complete our renovation programs  we anticipate our occupancy and adr performance will continue to improve 
food and beverage revenues remained flat to the prior year due to the continued closure of our west palm beach and melbourne hotels 
excluding the two hotels closed for hurricane renovations and the hotel acquired in december  food and beverage revenues were higher than the same period in other revenues  which declined by  were affected by a decline in telephone revenues as a result of the increased usage of cell phones by our guests as well as the availability of free high speed internet access at many of our hotels  as well as the continued closure of our west palm beach and melbourne hotels 

table of contents smith travel research recently forecast revpar growth in due to rising occupancy and room rates and improving supply and demand fundamentals 
we expect to realize some of the benefits of that growth as we continue to invest in our properties  although we will continue to experience displacement during our renovations 
direct operating expenses continuing operations increase decrease in thousands direct operating expenses rooms food and beverage other total direct operating expenses of total revenues direct operating expenses were higher due to higher revenues 
total direct operating expenses were higher in while total revenues were higher in furthermore  total direct operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained flat at in as compared to in room expenses on an actual cost per occupied room basis increased as a result of increases in payroll and benefit costs of the total increase  reservation equipment costs due to mandatory upgrades required by the intercontinental hotel group brands of the total increase  credit card  travel agent and other commissions of the total increase  and enhanced complimentary food and beverage items to guest enrolled in our brand loyalty programs of the total increase

table of contents other hotel operating costs increased million in as compared to as a result of increases in the following costs general and administrative costs increased million  primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits  costs related to labor union contract negotiations and higher bad debt expenses related to airline contracts  advertising and promotion expenses increased million due to increased costs of advertising market research materials and salary and benefit increases  franchise fees increased million primarily as a result of increased revenues 
as a percentage of room revenues  franchise fees were of revenues in as compared to in  largely due to increased costs of brand loyalty programs  and repairs and maintenance costs increased million primarily as a result of our continued focus on our preventative maintenance programs 
property and other taxes  insurance and leases decreased million including savings of million due to successful property tax assessment appeals  insurance premium and self insured loss savings of million due to favorable loss experience exclusive of the hurricanes and a stabilization of the insurance premium markets  and ground rent savings of million due to a settlement of a deferred ground rent obligation 
corporate and other expenses decreased million primarily as a result of reduced post emergence legal  professional and other costs related to the chapter proceedings and a reduction in a sales and use tax return audit reserve of million due to favorable audit settlements 
costs incurred related to sarbanes oxley compliance totaled approximately million 
casualty gains and losses  net  which represents costs related to hurricane damage  were million higher in as a result of eight properties incurring  in the aggregate  million in costs of which million was for hurricane repair expenses and approximately million was for net book value write offs of destroyed assets caused by the hurricanes that hit the southeastern united states in august and september  offset by expected insurance proceeds of million 
as of december   million had been released by our insurance company as advances for repairs on our crowne plaza west palm beach and holiday inn melbourne hotels 
all advances are forwarded to our lenders and we receive reimbursements from the lender held escrows as we incur operating and capital expenditures 
at december   we had received million in reimbursements from our lenders 
until the ultimate claims are settled  we will continue to recognize the advances received from the insurance company as a liability without offset to the insurance receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  at december   we have an insurance receivable balance of million and a liability for insurance advances of million 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million as a result of our reduced asset base on the continuing operations hotels due to million in asset write downs for impairment charges in and the reduced depreciation charges for assets that had a fresh start life of one year that are now fully depreciated 
the impairment of long lived assets of million recorded during represents reductions made to the carrying values of five hotels held for use  to bring them in line with their estimated fair values  and million for furniture  fixtures and equipment net book value write offs for items that were replaced in consistent with our accounting policy on asset impairment and in accordance with sfas no 
 we periodically evaluate our real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in the carrying value 
we record impairment charges if there are indicators of impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying values 
with respect to assets held for use  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by these assets 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each hotel with their respective carrying values to determine if there are indicators of impairment 
if there are indicators of impairment  we determine the estimated fair values of these assets in conjunction with our real estate brokers 
these broker valuations of fair value normally use the 
table of contents cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key approach  or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
as a result of these evaluations  we recorded impairment charges in as follows a million on the holiday inn express gadsden  al as this hotel was identified for sale in january and the estimated selling price of the hotel was less than the asset s carrying value 
the estimated selling price of this hotel was negatively impacted by its franchise agreement expiring in august and the franchisor indicating that it will not renew the agreement  b million on the holiday inn brunswick  ga as this hotel lost the business of a significant military group and the hotel is undergoing a required franchise conversion which is expected to result in reduced operating profits  c million on the quality inn hotel conference center metairie  la as capital improvements were spent on health and safety items that added no incremental market value or revenue generating capacity at this hotel  resulting in the recording of impairment to bring the asset s carrying value in line with the fair value  d million on the holiday inn st 
louis  mo as this hotel was identified for sale in january and the estimated selling price was less than the asset s previously adjusted carrying value  and e million on the holiday inn lawrence  ks as the financial performance of this hotel continues to decline as it is in need of a major renovation which is not economically justifiable as management has been notified the franchise agreement will not be renewed

minority interests represent the third party owners share of the net losses of the joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest 
the million reduction in losses attributable to minority interests primarily resulted from the reduction in impairment charges at our macon property in as compared to  partially offset by hurricane related losses in at our melbourne property 
the year ended december  compared to the combined period revenues continuing operations combined period increase decrease revenues in thousands rooms food and beverage other total revenues occupancy adr revpar the decline in rooms revenues results from the decline in occupancy and adr 
occupancy declined by while adr declined by 
the decline in occupancy reflected the general decline in the lodging industry but also reflected  in part  some loss in volume due to renovations being performed at some of our hotels  brand changes and reduced performance at some hotels due to their need for renovation 
the decline in adr was due to lower demand for hotels as well as a change in buying patterns with more guests purchasing discounted rooms via the internet 
food and beverage and other revenues were also affected by the decline in occupancy and a reduction in group banquet and catering functions 
other revenues  which declined by  were affected by a decline in telephone revenues as a result of the increased usage of cell phones by our guests as well as the availability of free high speed internet access at some of our hotels 

table of contents direct operating expenses continuing operations combined period increase decrease in thousands direct operating expenses rooms food and beverage other total direct operating expenses of total revenues direct operating expenses were lower due to lower revenues 
however  these expenses were not reduced proportionately with revenues due to fixed costs and the need to maintain minimum levels of service regardless of occupancy declines 
fixed costs primarily relate to salaried employees and benefits 
rooms expenses on an actual cost per occupied room basis increased as a result of increases in benefit costs of the total increase  enhanced complimentary food and beverage items to guests enrolled in our brand loyalty programs of the total increase and general cost increases for expendable items used in the rooms department 
benefit costs include group health insurance  our k plan and workers compensation 
due to declining room demand in the first half of and a shift in room demand to internet booking sites that provide discounted room rates  we were unable to achieve gains in adr to offset these cost increases 
the food and beverage department benefited from our improved purchasing program and greater controls over inventory  partially offset by increased benefit costs 
other expenses decreased by million due in part to a million decline in telephone expenses as a result of increased usage of cell phones by our guests

table of contents utility costs increased million due to increases in rates and increases in consumption caused by severe weather conditions in the northeast 
property and other taxes  insurance and leases were million higher in primarily as a result of the following insurance costs increased million due to increased insurance premium costs and safety training programs  ground and property rent increased million due to escalation clauses in the lease agreements  and equipment rentals decreased by million as a result of the initiation of improved lease programs for hotel vans  copier and other equipment 
corporate and other costs were million higher in primarily as a result of the following we incurred million in legal  professional and other costs related to the chapter proceedings 
prior to our emergence from chapter  these costs were classified as reorganization expenses  and legal and other professional fees decreased by approximately million partially as a result of our reduced reliance on external professional services and also as a result of the resolution of a number of litigation cases through the chapter proceedings 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million lower in depreciation expense was reduced as a result of fresh start reporting 
as part of fresh start reporting  we were required to adjust our assets to fair values and  as a result  recorded a net write down of fixed assets of million 
after implementing fresh start reporting  our monthly depreciation decreased by million million annualized 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in amortization of deferred franchise fees due to an increase in the fair values of deferred franchise fees 
the impairment of long lived assets of million recorded during represents million in adjustments made to the carrying values of five hotels held for use  to reduce them to their estimated fair values  and million for furniture  fixtures and equipment net book value write offs for items that were replaced in consistent with our accounting policy on asset impairment and in accordance with sfas no 
 we periodically evaluate our real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in the carrying value 
we record impairment charges if there are indicators of impairment  the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying values and the assets carrying values are in excess of their estimated fair values 
with respect to assets held for use  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by these assets 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each hotel with their respective carrying values to determine if there are indicators of impairment 
if there are indicators of impairment  we determine the estimated fair values of these assets in conjunction with our real estate brokers 
these broker valuations of fair value normally use the cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key valuation approach  or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
as a result of these evaluations  we recorded impairment charges in as follows a million on the crown plaza macon  ga as the expected holding period for this hotel was reduced to six months because the company was unable to locate a lender to refinance the maturing mortgage on this hotel as a single asset loan  b million on the holiday inn st

we expect these variations to continue for a variety of reasons  primarily seasonality 
however  due to the fixed nature of certain expenses  such as marketing and rent  our operating expenses do not vary as significantly from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we use our cash flows primarily for operating expenses  debt service  and capital expenditures 
currently  our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations and existing cash balances 
cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by factors such as a reduction in demand for lodging or displacement from large scale renovations being performed at our hotels 
to the extent that significant amounts of our accounts receivable are due from airline companies  a further downturn in the airline industry also could materially and adversely affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and hence our liquidity 
at december   airline receivables represented approximately of our accounts receivable  net of allowances 
a further downturn in the airline industry could also affect our revenues by decreasing the aggregate levels of demand for travel 
we expect that the sale of certain assets will provide additional cash to pay down outstanding debt and to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 
eleven hotels and two land parcels were sold in at december  we had seven hotels and one land parcel classified as held for 
table of contents sale 
of the hotels  one office building and two land parcels that were sold between november  and march   the aggregate net proceeds received from these sales were million  of which million was used to pay down debt and million was used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
our ability to make scheduled debt service payments and fund operations and capital expenditures depends on our future performance and financial results  including the successful implementation of our business strategy and  to a certain extent  the general condition of the lodging industry and the general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory environment 
in addition  our ability to refinance our indebtedness depends to a certain extent on these factors as well 
many factors affecting our future performance and financial results  including the severity and duration of macro economic downturns  are beyond our control 
see matters which may affect future results risks related to our business 
in june  we completed an offering to the public of our common stock  the purpose of which was to redeem our preferred stock  to fund capital expenditures related to renovations and repositionings of selected hotels  and for general corporate purposes including funding our growth strategy 
in connection with this offering  we refinanced approximately million of our floating rate mortgage debt in order to extend maturities and to convert a substantial portion of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
we intend to continue to use our cash flow to make scheduled debt service payments and fund operations and capital expenditures and  therefore  do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future although we have emerged from chapter  the distribution of shares to the general unsecured creditors is not complete as we continue to reconcile the claims made by these creditors 
at december    shares were in the disputed claims reserve and million is reserved in other accrued liabilities for settlement of pre petition claims 
until this process is complete  we will continue to incur expenses in respect of these claims as well as bankruptcy court fees and professional fees 
in accordance with gaap  all assets held for sale  including assets that would normally be classified as long term assets in the normal course of business  were reported as assets held for sale in current assets 
similarly  all liabilities related to assets held for sale were reported as liabilities related to assets held for sale in current liabilities  including debt that would otherwise be classified as long term liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
at december   we had working capital current assets less current liabilities of million compared to million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the cash proceeds received from the june common stock offering 
the net proceeds to us from the common stock offering approximated million  of which million was used to fund reserve accounts with merrill lynch mortgage pursuant to requirements in our june refinancing debt agreements 
a reserve of million was funded for capital expenditures and a reserve of million was funded for requirements related to a hotel ground lease that was ultimately resolved at approximately million 
on july   we used approximately million of the proceeds from our equity offering to redeem all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock  including accrued dividends and a prepayment premium 
approximately million in cash replaced the  shares of preferred stock held in the disputed claims reserve  and  accordingly  a million liability was established on our consolidated balance sheet 
eight of our hotels were damaged by the hurricanes that hit the southeastern united states in august and september two hotels  our crowne plaza west palm beach and holiday inn melbourne hotels  suffered extensive damage and were closed for renovation in september and are expected to reopen in the third quarter of we estimate that approximately million will be spent in capital expenditures to repair these eight hotels 
approximately million is forecast to be spent in these repairs are subject to deductibles based on of their insured values and apply for each insurable event 
six hotels had losses that are estimated to exceed their applicable deductibles 
the aggregate deductible for these six hotels totals million 
three of our hotels were hit by two different hurricanes and  accordingly  they are subject to two 
table of contents separate deductibles  and in the case of our west palm beach property  an environmental policy deductible for mold of million  for an aggregate deductible of million 
for the three hotels that were hit by one hurricane  their aggregate deductible is million 
additionally  we have submitted business interruption claims of approximately million for the september to december period to our insurance carriers for reimbursement of lost profits and additional expenses incurred as a result of these hurricanes for our crowne plaza west palm beach and holiday inn melbourne hotels that have been closed since september the timing of the reimbursements for these property damage and business interruption claims is unknown and could place substantial cash flow pressure on us 
additionally  we may incur capital expenditures that will not be reimbursed by insurance proceeds because it is practicable to do so while the property is under renovation 
failure to be reimbursed on a timely basis for insurable expenditures by our insurance carriers could adversely affect our liquidity 
during the fourth quarter and the year ended december   we spent approximately million and million on capital expenditures for our continuing operations and million and million on our discontinued operations  respectively 
during  we expect to spend million on our hotels  which includes committed hurricane repair capital expenditures of approximately million  much of which we anticipate will be covered by insurance proceeds  to complete substantially all of our deferred renovations 
we believe that the combination of our current cash  cash flows from operations  capital expenditure escrows and asset sales will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next months 
our ability to meet our long term cash needs is dependent on the continuation and extent of the recovery of the economy and the lodging industry  improved operating results  the successful implementation of our portfolio improvement strategy and our ability to obtain third party sources of capital on favorable terms when and as needed 
in the short term  we continue to diligently monitor our costs 
our future financial needs and sources of working capital are  however  subject to uncertainty  and we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to be able to meet our operating expenses  debt service requirements  including scheduled maturities  and planned capital expenditures 
we could lose the right to operate certain hotels under nationally recognized brand names  and furthermore  the termination of one or more franchise agreements could trigger defaults and acceleration under one or more loan agreements as well as obligations to pay liquidated damages under the franchise agreements if we are unable to find a suitable replacement franchisor 
see matters which may affect future results risks related to our business for further discussion of conditions that could adversely affect our estimates of future liquidity needs and sources of working capital

merrill lynch mortgage also has the right to further divide the refinancing debt into first priority mortgage loans and mezzanine loans 
prior to any securitization of the four fixed rate loans  those loans are subject to cross collateralization provisions 
two of the four fixed rate loans have been securitized as of march  each of the four fixed rate loans fixed rate loan comprising the fixed rate debt is a five year loan and bears a fixed rate of interest of 
except for certain defeasance provisions  we may not prepay the fixed rate debt except during the days prior to maturity 
we may  after the earlier of months after the closing of any fixed rate loan or the second anniversary of the securitization of any fixed rate loan  defease such fixed rate loan  in whole or in part 
the floating rate debt is a two year loan with three one year extension options and bears interest at libor plus 
the first extension option will be available to us only if no defaults exist and we have entered into the requisite interest rate cap agreement 
the second and third extension options will be available to us only if no defaults exist  a minimum debt yield ratio of is met  and minimum debt service coverage ratios of x for the second extension and x for the third extension are met 
an extension fee of of the outstanding floating rate debt is payable if we opt to exercise each of the second and third extensions

repayments of debt related to assets held for sale at june  are exempt from the prepayment penalty 
the refinancing debt provides that when either i the debt yield ratio for the hotels securing the floating rate debt or any fixed rate loan for the trailing month period is below during the first year  during the second year and  and during each of the next three years in the case of the floating rate debt to the extent extended  or ii in the case of the floating rate debt to the extent extended  the debt service coverage ratio is less than x in the fourth year or x in the fifth year  excess cash flows produced by the mortgaged hotels securing the applicable loan after payment of operating expenses  management fees  required reserves  service fees  principal and interest must be deposited in a restricted cash account

funds will no longer be deposited into the restricted cash account when the debt yield ratio and  if applicable  the debt service coverage ratio are sustained above the minimum requirements for three consecutive months and there are no defaults 
as of december   our debt yield ratios were above the minimum requirement for the four fixed rate loans  however  we did not meet the required debt yield ratio with regard to the floating rate loan 
as a result  all excess cash generated by the assets that secure this floating rate loan may  at the option of the lender  be placed into a restricted cash account and these restricted funds can be used for prepayment of the loan  capital expenditures  or scheduled principal and interest payments up to million as designated above 
funds will no longer be retained in the restricted cash account when the debt yield ratio is sustained above the minimum requirement for three consecutive months and there are no defaults

each loan comprising the refinancing debt is non recourse  however  we have agreed to indemnify merrill lynch mortgage in certain situations  such as fraud  waste  misappropriation of funds  certain 
table of contents environmental matters  asset transfers in violation of the loan agreements  or violation of certain single purpose entity covenants 
in addition  each loan comprising the refinancing debt will become full recourse in certain limited cases such as bankruptcy of a borrower or lodgian 
during the term of the refinancing debt  we are required to fund  on a monthly basis  a reserve for furniture  fixtures and equipment equal to of the previous month s gross revenues from the hotels securing each of the respective loans comprising the refinancing debt 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio requirement of the loan from column financial secured by nine of our hotels  primarily due to the fact that one of the hotels securing this loan new orleans airport plaza hotel is not currently affiliated with a national brand and is undergoing a major renovation 
we have entered into a franchise agreement with radisson hotels international  inc to rebrand this property as a radisson hotel and expect to complete the renovation and open the hotel as a radisson in may the total investment we are making on the renovation of this property and its rebranding is million 
in addition  we will be completing capital expenditures of approximately million on two other hotels in this loan pool in under the terms of the column financial loan agreement until the required dscr is met  the lender is permitted to require the borrowers to deposit all revenues from the mortgaged properties into an account controlled by the lender 
the revenues are then disbursed to pay property expenses in accordance with the loan agreement 
the lender may apply excess proceeds after payment of expenses to additional principal payments 
however  as of december   the lender has not elected to require revenue for these properties to be deposited into its account 
additionally  as of september   we were not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio requirement of the loan from column financial secured by one of our hotels in phoenix  arizona 
the primary reason why the debt service coverage ratio is below the required threshold is due to the property undergoing an extensive renovation in in order to convert from a holiday inn select to a crowne plaza 
the renovation caused substantial revenue displacement which  in turn  negatively affected the financial performance of this hotel 
under the terms of the column financial loan agreement until the required dscr is met  the lender is permitted to require the borrower to deposit all revenues from the mortgaged property into an account controlled by the lender 
accordingly  in december  we were notified by the lender that we were in default of the debt service coverage ratio and would have to establish a restricted cash account whereby all cash generated by the property be deposited in an account from which all payments of interest  principal  operating expenses and impounds insurance  property taxes and ground rent would be disbursed 
the lender may apply excess proceeds after payment of expenses to additional principal payments third party paid loan costs  incurred as a part of the refinancing debt  totaling million  were deferred and will be amortized using the effective yield method over five years for the fixed rate debt and three years for the floating rate debt 
other financings on november   loans approximating million  secured by hotels  were substantially reinstated on their original terms  except for the extension of certain maturities 
the terms of one other loan  in the amount of million and secured by one hotel  were amended to provide for a new interest rate and a new maturity date 
through our wholly owned subsidiaries  we owe approximately million under industrial revenue bonds secured by the holiday inns lawrence  kansas and manhattan  kansas hotels 
for the year ended december   the cash flows of the two hotels were insufficient to meet the minimum debt service coverage ratio requirements 
on march   we notified the trustee of the industrial revenue bonds which finance the holiday inns in lawrence  kansas and manhattan  kansas that we would not continue to make debt service payments 
the holiday inn franchise agreements for both of these hotels expire on august   and each of these properties has a substantial amount of deferred capital expenditures 
the failure to make debt service payments is a default under the bond indenture and also a default under the ground leases for these properties 
the company will attempt to restructure the debt on these hotels  but no assurance can be given that we will be successful in doing so

the  shares of preferred stock that were part of the disputed claims reserve were replaced with approximately million of cash  and accordingly  we recorded a liability of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
approximately million was paid for the prepayment premium on the preferred stock when it was redeemed on july  as of december   the company had no outstanding preferred stock shares

franchise agreements and capital expenditures we benefit from the superior brand qualities of crowne plaza  holiday inn  marriott  hilton and other brands 
included in the benefits of these brands are their reputation for quality and service  revenue generation through their central reservation systems  access to revenue through the global distribution systems  guest loyalty programs and brand internet booking sites 
reservations made by means of these franchisor facilities generally account for approximately of our total reservations 
to obtain these franchise affiliations  we enter into franchise agreements with hotel franchisors that generally have terms of between and years 
the franchise agreements typically authorize us to operate the hotel under the franchise name  at a specific location or within a specified area  and require that we operate the hotel in accordance with the standards specified by the franchisor 
as part of our franchise agreements  we are generally required to pay a royalty fee  an advertising marketing fee  a fee for the use of the franchisor s nationwide reservation system and certain other ancillary charges 
royalty fees range from to of gross room revenues  advertising marketing fees range from to  reservation system fees range from to and club and restaurant fees from to 
in the aggregate  royalty fees  advertis 
table of contents ing marketing fees  reservation fees and other ancillary fees for the various brands under which we operate our hotels range from to of gross room revenues 
these costs vary with revenues and are not fixed commitments 
franchise fees incurred which are reported in other hotel operating costs on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   december   and the combined period were as follows combined period in thousands continuing operations discontinued operations during the term of the franchise agreements  the franchisors may require us to upgrade facilities to comply with their current standards 
our current franchise agreements terminate at various times and have differing remaining terms 
for example  the terms of  eight and seven of our franchise agreements are scheduled to expire in   and  respectively 
as franchise agreements expire  we may apply for a franchise renewal 
in connection with renewals  the franchisor may require payment of a renewal fee  increased royalty and other recurring fees and substantial renovation of the facilities  or the franchisor may elect not to renew the franchise 
the costs incurred in connection with these agreements are primarily monthly payments due to the franchisors based on a percentage of room revenues 
if we do not comply with the terms of a franchise agreement  following notice and an opportunity to cure  the franchisor has the right to terminate the agreement  which could lead to a default under one or more of our loan agreements  and which could materially and adversely affect us 
prior to terminating a franchise agreement  franchisors are required to notify us of the areas of non compliance and give us the opportunity to cure the non compliance 
in the past  we have been able to cure most cases of non compliance and most defaults within the cure periods  and those events of non compliance and defaults did not cause termination of our franchises or defaults on our loan agreements 
if we perform an economic analysis of the hotel and determine that it is not economically feasible to comply with a franchisor s requirements  we will either select an alternative franchisor or operate the hotel without a franchise affiliation 
however  terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel could require us to incur significant expenses  including liquidated damages  and capital expenditures 
our loan agreements generally prohibit a hotel from operating without a franchise 
as of march   we had been notified that we were not in compliance with some of the terms of of our franchise agreements and have received default and termination notices from franchisors with respect to an additional nine hotels summarized as follows five of these hotels are held for sale  seven of the remaining hotels either just completed a major renovation  are undergoing a major renovation or a major renovation is planned  and the total cost of the renovations is projected to be million of which million has been spent  one of the remaining hotels has a franchise agreement that expires in and is expected to be renovated upon selection of a new franchise 
the total cost of the renovation will not be known until the franchisor inspects the property  four of the remaining hotels are expected to be in full compliance with their franchise agreements during the next testing period  two of the remaining hotels are above the required franchise thresholds and must remain above those levels until february to receive a clean slate letter  
table of contents one of the remaining hotels has implemented plans to improve service levels to return to compliance levels  and one hotel  which is owned by the company  will undergo a major renovation after we complete the buyout of our minority partner in the second quarter of the renovation is expected to be completed in the first quarter of and is estimated to cost million 
we have met all the requirements to cure six of the continuing operations hotels by the due date and received on march  cure letters for two of these hotels 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to complete our action plans  which in aggregate are estimated to cost approximately million  to cure the alleged defaults prior to the specified termination dates or any extended time granted to cure any defaults 
we believe we are in compliance with our other franchise agreements in all material aspects 
while we can give no assurance that the steps taken to date  and planned to be taken during  will return these properties to full compliance  we believe that we will make significant progress and we intend to continue to give franchise agreement compliance a high level of attention 
the hotels that are either in default or non compliance under the respective franchise agreements secure million of mortgage debt at march  due to cross collateralization provisions 
in addition  as part of our bankruptcy reorganization proceedings  we entered into stipulations with each of our major franchisors setting forth a timeline for completion of capital expenditures for some of our hotels 
however  as of march   we have not completed the required capital expenditures for hotels in accordance with the stipulations and estimate that completing those improvements will cost million of which million is reserved with our lenders 
under the stipulations  the applicable franchisors could therefore seek to declare certain franchise agreements in default and  in certain circumstances  seek to terminate the franchise agreement 
we have scheduled or have begun renovations on of these hotels aggregating million of the million 
in addition  six of these hotels are held for sale and represent million of the million 
we expect to receive addendums to our franchise agreements for the holiday inn monroeville  pa  the holiday inn washington meadowlands  pa and the holiday inn select in strongsville  oh hotels 
these addendums are being prepared by ihg as a result of the property improvement plan pip renovation defaults issued on october  and our failure to cure these pip defaults by getting these required renovations significantly underway by december  ihg is granting us additional time to complete this renovation work subject to milestone renovation dates as mutually agreed upon by us and ihg 
the capital expenditures related to these three hotels total million  million of which is reserved at our lenders 
the agreed upon completion date for these three hotels is october  and we are subject to monetary penalties if we do not comply with the agreed upon milestone and completion dates 
in addition  ihg may elect to terminate the franchise agreements for these three hotels if the pip has not been completed  and in the event of a termination  we may be subject to liquidated damages 
we anticipate that we will be able to meet these milestone and completion deadlines 
during  we entered into new franchise agreements for all of our marriott branded hotels at that time and agreed to pay a fee aggregating approximately million  of which million has been paid  and million is payable in  subject to offsets 
in connection with our agreement  marriott may review the capital improvements we have made at our marriott franchised hotels during  and may  in its reasonable business judgment  require us to make additional property improvements and to place amounts into a reserve account for the purpose of funding those property improvements 
to comply with the requirements of our franchisors  to improve our competitive position in individual markets  and repair hurricane damaged hotels  we plan to spend million on our hotels in  which includes committed hurricane repair capital expenditures of approximately million  much of which we anticipate will be covered by insurance proceeds 
this will substantially complete all of our deferred renovations 
we spent million on capital expenditures during on our continuing operations hotels

new accounting pronouncements on may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which aims to eliminate diversity in practice by requiring that certain types of freestanding instruments be reported as liabilities by their issuers including mandatorily redeemable instruments issued in the form of shares which unconditionally obligate the issuer to redeem the shares for cash or by transferring other assets 
these instruments were previously presented in various ways  as part of liabilities  as part of equity  or between the liabilities and equity sections sometimes referred to as mezzanine reporting 
the provisions of sfas no 
 which also include a number of new disclosure requirements  were effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  for pre existing instruments  sfas no 
was effective as of the beginning of the first interim period which commenced after june  july  for the company 
the company adopted sfas no 
on july  the adoption impacted the treatment of its mandatorily redeemable cumulative preferred stock preferred stock  previously presented between total liabilities and stockholders equity 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the preferred stock has been included as part of long term debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the preferred stock dividends for the period july  to december  has been included in interest expense 
the preferred stock dividends for the period january  to june  of million continue to be shown as a deduction from retained earnings 
if the company were to be required to comply with the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas no 
as currently drafted  the company would be required to reclassify certain amounts currently included in minority interest to the liability section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the minority partners interests would be recorded at the estimated current liquidation amounts 
if this treatment of the minority interests was effected in the current fiscal period  the company s earnings would have been impacted 
under the proposed standard  the liability would require quarterly review and changes to the current liquidation amounts would be recorded as interest expense 
on october   the fasb decided to defer the effective date of sfas no 
related to non controlling interests 
as a result  until the fasb establishes further guidance  the company will not have to measure the mandatorily redeemable minority interests at fair value 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our variable rate debt 
at december  and december   we had outstanding variable rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
on may   we finalized the million lehman financing  which was repaid on june  the lehman financing was a two year term loan with an optional one year extension and bore interest at the higher of or libor plus 
in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the lehman financing  we entered into a two year interest rate cap agreement  which allowed us to obtain this financing at a partial floating rate and effectively capped the interest rate at libor of plus 
if libor exceeded  the contracts would have required settlement of net interest receivable at specified intervals  which generally coincided with the dates on which interest was payable on the underlying debt 
when libor was below  there was no settlement from the interest rate cap 
we were exposed to interest rate risks on the lehman financing for libor of between and 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate cap outstanding was million at december  on june   we refinanced both the merrill lynch exit financing and the lehman financing 
the new refinancing is organized in four fixed rate pools and one floating rate pool 
in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the floating pool  we entered into a two year interest rate cap agreement  which allowed us to obtain this financing at a floating rate and effectively cap the interest rate at libor of plus 
when libor exceeds  the contract requires settlement of net interest receivable at specified intervals  which generally coincide with the dates on which interest is payable on the underlying debt 
when libor is below  there is no settlement from the interest rate cap 
we are exposed to interest rate risks on the floating pool for increases in libor up to  but we are not exposed to increases in libor above because settlements from the interest rate caps would offset the incremental interest expense 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate cap outstanding was million at december  the fair value of the interest rate cap related to the refinancing debt as of december  was approximately  the fair value of the interest rate cap related to the lehman financing as of december  and december  was approximately nil and  respectively 
we also had two interest rate caps that expired in november that related to our exit financing  which had a nominal value of nil at december  the fair values of the interest rate caps were recognized on the balance sheet in other assets 
adjustments to the carrying values of the interest rate caps are reflected in interest expense 
as a result of having our four interest rate caps  we believe that our interest rate risk at december  and december  was minimal 
the impact on annual results of operations of a hypothetical one point interest rate reduction on the interest rate caps as of december  would be a reduction in net income of approximately  these derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we have not elected the hedging requirements of sfas no 
at december   approximately million of debt instruments outstanding were subject to changes in libor 
without regard to additional borrowings under those instruments or scheduled amortization  the annualized effect of each twenty five basis point increase in libor would be a reduction in income before income taxes of approximately million 
the fair value of the fixed rate debt book value million at december  is estimated at million 
the nature of our fixed rate obligations does not expose us to fluctuations in interest payments 
the impact on the fair value of our fixed rate obligations of a hypothetical one point interest rate increase on the 
table of contents outstanding fixed rate debt as of december  and december  would be approximately million in each year
