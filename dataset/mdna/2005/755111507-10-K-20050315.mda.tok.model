defense industry considerations the global war on terrorism  operation enduring freedom  and operation iraqi freedom  have altered the defense and security environment of the united states 
these events have had  and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have  a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products 
the us department of defense dod continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations and transforming our military to confront future threats 
our customers plan to operate in a new paradigm 
they define an approach that emphasizes speed  precision  and flexibility  and by sharing superior knowledge  enables forces to seize and sustain initiative  concentrate combat power  and prevent an enemy response 
in this new environment  the need for advanced technology and defense electronics is clear 
the recent growth in military expenditures is driven by the multi pronged approach required to fight the war on terrorism  replenish war materials consumed during continued operations in afghanistan and iraq  and sustain the momentum in pursuit of transformation 
the company is an active participant in all three efforts 
much of the company s business is with the dod  and the company s future growth prospects are sensitive to changes in the dod budget 
in particular  the dod research  development  test and evaluation rdt e budget and the dod procurement budget  collectively known as the investment accounts  are a key source of funding for the company s programs 
the future years defense program included in the president s fy budget submission to congress shows continued projected growth in the investment accounts through fy  with some shift from rdt e to procurement in the later years 
the fy supplemental request submitted to congress  while primarily targeted to supporting ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan  also includes proposed additional investment account funding 
the company s strategy is designed to capitalize on the breadth and depth of the company s technology and domain expertise in order to meet the evolving needs of the company s customers 
the company is focusing on the following strategic business areas  which are aligned with the ongoing military operations and department of defense transformation goals and the goals of the department of homeland security missile defense precision engagement intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance homeland security missile defense the company is working with the us missile defense agency and other companies to develop and test a layered system that will detect  identify  and intercept missiles in all phases of flight the boost  midcourse  and terminal phases 
the fundamental components of integrated missile defense are sensors  interceptors  command and control  and systems integration 
the company is a technology leader in all of these 
table of contents areas 
the company is committed to helping the us missile defense agency to develop an operational ballistic missile defense system 
the company s broad array of solutions provides the capability to detect and respond to threats at all three phases of the missile defense system 
the company s programs addressing all three phases include ballistic missile defense system radar  space tracking and surveillance system  and cobra judy radar 
the kinetic energy interceptor addresses the boost phase 
the company s programs addressing the midcourse phase include upgraded early warning radars  exo atmospheric kill vehicle  sea based x band radar  and standard missile those addressing the terminal phase threat include the patriot air and missile defense system  terminal high altitude area defense thaad battle management command control and communication  and thaad ground based radar 
precision engagement the company provides mission solutions across the entire precision engagement chain 
the company s customers are increasingly looking for mission solutions that address the need to operate jointly across services and between allied forces  work in a new net centric paradigm  minimize collateral damage  and strike time sensitive targets 
the company s precision engagement systems include f and f a active electronically scanned array radars  advanced medium range air to air missile  miniature air launched decoy  situation awareness data link  uk joint effects tactical targeting system  netfires  joint standoff weapon  paveway  tactical tomahawk  f a radar warning receiver  high power microwave  and high energy lasers 
intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance the company s sensing  processing  and dissemination technologies effectively compress the information gap from hours to minutes 
the company provides integrated systems solutions for observing  locating  processing  deciding  and disseminating actionable information  enabling network centric operations for decision makers 
these abilities are crucial for war fighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace 
the company s key isr programs include global hawk sensor suite  distributed common ground system  space based radar  national polar orbiting operational environmental satellite systems  future combat systems ground sensor integrator  and numerous classified programs 
homeland security in the area of homeland security  the company continues to leverage the technologies and solutions it has developed for its traditional defense markets to provide solutions to homeland security customers 
recent efforts have focused on the exploitation of the company s expertise in the collection and analysis of large amounts of data 
this has led to wins in border security  most notably us visit  and in related areas 
the company provides electronics for a wide range of missions and platforms and has several thousand active programs with us government and other customers 
the company believes that this diversification reduces some of the risk and volatility often inherent in the defense industry 
the company generally acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor on its programs 
the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional authorization and appropriation 
while congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  major defense programs are usually conducted under binding contracts over multiple years 
the termination of funding for a us government program could result in a loss of future revenues  which would have a negative effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
us government contracts are also subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination 
failure to comply with us government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from us government contracting 
sales to the us government may be affected by changes in procurement policies  budget considerations  changing defense requirements  and political developments 
the influence of these factors  which are largely beyond the company s control  could impact the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents aircraft industry considerations as the economy has been recovering  indicated by several measures including gross domestic product  corporate profits  and personal disposable income  the general aviation market has been recovering as well 
although still below its peak performance in  reflected an improvement compared to the depressed level of activity experienced in and traditionally  the used aircraft market has led the recovery of the new aircraft market by months and although worldwide levels of used aircraft available for sale have declined  a slower or delayed economic recovery could delay market demand for used  and ultimately new aircraft 
the decline in the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale has resulted in improved pricing of new aircraft and many manufacturers have increased line or production rates 
in order to support a continued recovery of the new aircraft market  however  the current worldwide inventory of used aircraft must be reduced even further 
due to the lower levels of used inventory and strong third and fourth quarter sales activity for new aircraft  the industry consensus is that the market for new aircraft will continue to improve in and into the foreseeable future 
it is unknown at this time what impact  if any  will be felt without the benefit of bonus depreciation from the jobs growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which expired in financial summary as discussed in more detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross bookings were billion in  billion in  and billion in  resulting in backlog of billion  billion  and billion at december    and  respectively 
backlog represents future sales expected to be recognized over the next several years 
net sales were billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase in sales was a result of strong growth at the defense businesses  primarily integrated defense systems and space and airborne systems as well as growth at raytheon aircraft 
operating income was billion in  billion in  and billion in operating income as a percent of net sales was percent  percent  and percent in   and  respectively 
included in operating income was a fas cas pension adjustment  described below in consolidated results of operations  of million of expense in  million of expense in  and million of income in the fas cas pension adjustment in is expected to approximate the amount 
also included in operating income in were charges on certain programs at network centric systems and technical services of million 
operating cash flow from continuing operations was billion in  billion in  and billion in total debt was billion at december  versus billion at december  critical accounting policies the company has identified the following accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate 
sales under long term government contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales when work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to the company s estimates of total costs and contract value 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  materials  warranty  and overhead 
some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets which are included at estimated realizable value 
contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
due to the long term nature of many of the company s programs  developing estimates of total costs and contract value often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be 
table of contents performed  the impact of change orders  availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  award fee estimations  and the recoverability of claims 
in   and  operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses did not vary by more than percent 
if operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses had been higher or lower by percent in  the company s operating income would have changed by approximately million 
the company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at raytheon aircraft 
lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be delivered and measuring an average cost over the entire lot for each aircraft sold 
the costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average cost of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
once the initial lot has been completed  the use of lot accounting is discontinued 
the selection of lot size is a critical judgment 
the company determines lot size based on several factors  including the size of firm backlog  market and competitive conditions  the expected annual production for the aircraft  and experience on similar new aircraft 
the size of the initial lot for the beechcraft premier i is units 
the size of the initial lot for the hawker horizon is units 
a five percent increase in the remaining estimated costs to produce the initial lots of these two aircraft would reduce the company s operating income by approximately million in the aggregate 
the valuation of used aircraft in inventories  which are stated at cost  but not in excess of realizable value  requires significant judgment 
as part of the assessment of realizable value  the company must evaluate many factors including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft  and availability levels for the aircraft in the market 
a five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of used aircraft in inventory at december   would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the valuation of aircraft materials and parts that support the worldwide fleet of aircraft  which are stated at cost  but not in excess of realizable value  also requires significant judgment 
as part of the assessment of realizable value  the company must evaluate many factors including the expected useful life of the aircraft  some of which have remained in service for up to years 
a five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of aircraft materials and parts at december   would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows 
when an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
the determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment  the estimation of future cash flows  and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 
in addition  the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company estimates the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on the company s most recent five year plan and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involve significant judgments 
changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period  however  a percent decrease in the current fair value of each of the company s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 
the company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
the company s long term return on asset roa and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
to develop the long term roa assumption  the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the company has invested pension plan assets  and the expectations 
table of contents for future returns of each asset class 
since the company s investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes  the potential exists to outperform the broader markets  therefore  the expected returns are higher than the broader markets 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon an asset allocation within the company s policy allocation ranges to develop the long term roa assumption 
the policy asset allocation ranges are between and percent equities with a expected return  between and percent fixed income with a expected return  between and percent real estate with a expected return  and between and percent other including private equity and cash with a expected return 
the long term roa assumption for the company s domestic pension plans in is 
the discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of theoretical bond portfolios that match the various durations of the company s pension liability duration 
the discount rate assumption for the company s domestic pension plans in is 
the company s pension expense is expected to be approximately million in and million in for every percent that the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term roa assumption for  the company s pension expense for will change by approximately million 
if the company adjusts the discount rate assumption for up or down by basis points  the company s pension expense for would change by approximately million 
consolidated results of operations net sales were billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase in sales was due primarily to higher us department of defense expenditures in the company s defense businesses  primarily integrated defense systems and space and airborne systems as well as higher sales at raytheon aircraft 
sales to the us department of defense were percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in total sales to the us government  including foreign military sales  were percent of sales in and and percent in international sales  including foreign military sales  were billion or percent of sales in  billion or percent in  and billion or percent in while international sales have remained essentially flat  the amount as a percent of sales has declined as a result of increased sales to the us department of defense 
gross margin net sales less cost of sales was billion in  billion in  and billion in  or percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in included in gross margin was a fas cas pension adjustment  described below  of million of expense  million of expense  and million of income in   and  respectively 
the change in the fas cas pension adjustment was due primarily to the reduction in the company s discount rate assumption under sfas no 
and the actual rate of return on pension plan assets in and the decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales in and was due to the increase in the fas cas pension adjustment 
also included in gross margin in were charges of million at network centric systems and million at technical services 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes  which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans  which are determined by other factors 
a major factor in determining pension funding requirements are cost accounting standards cas that proscribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on us government contracts 
the difference between sfas no 
fas pension expense or income and cas pension expense is reported as a separate line item in the company s segment results called fas cas pension adjustment 
the results for each segment only include pension expense as determined under cas  which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the us government
