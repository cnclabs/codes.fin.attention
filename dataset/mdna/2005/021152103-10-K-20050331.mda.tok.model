overview general we are a biotechnology company primarily focused on the research and development of biopharmaceutical products for the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system  or cns  diseases 
at december   we are considered a development stage enterprise as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
as of december   we have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately million 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as management executes our current business plan 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  will not provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december   combined with approximately  in net proceeds raised in a private placement of common stock completed in march   in net proceeds received through the exercise of certain warrants in february  and our ability to control certain costs  including those related to clinical trial programs  pre clinical activities  and certain general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through july we will need to raise additional capital in through a collaboration  merger or other transaction with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or through a debt financing or equity offerings by us to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to continue development of our programs in  including the phase iii trial of altropane as a diagnostic for ps  the phase ii trial of altropane as a diagnostic for adhd  and our pre clinical programs including inosine and o may be affected by the availability of financial resources to fund each program 
during  financial considerations may cause us to modify planned development activities for one or more of our programs  and we may decide to suspend development of one or more programs until we are able to secure additional working capital 
if we are not able to raise additional capital in  we will not have sufficient funds to complete the phase iii clinical trial of altropane as a diagnostic for ps or the phase ii trial of altropane as a diagnostic for adhd 
we have previously provided estimates regarding when we expected to attain various milestones associated with the development of our programs 
these estimates included projected dates regarding the initiation or completion of clinical trials  as well as the submission of regulatory filings such as an ind or nda 
estimating trial initiation and completion dates  as well as regulatory filing dates  is extremely difficult as there are numerous uncertainties associated with attaining these milestones  many of which are beyond our control 
uncertainties associated with the initiation or completion of clinical trials include obtaining fda approval regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials  the rate of patient enrollment  the level of compliance by clinical sites to clinical trial protocols  and the availability of clinical trial material 
uncertainties associated with the submission of regulatory filings includes reliance on third parties to complete necessary pre clinical studies and regulatory documents  the results of pre clinical and clinical studies  and the fda s responses to and acceptance of our regulatory filings 
in addition  the adequacy of our financial resources may also affect our ability to meet estimated timelines 
due to our current financial condition and the uncertainties described above  we have determined not to provide estimates regarding when we expect to initiate or complete a clinical trial or file an ind  nda  or any other regulatory filing 
all previous timelines that we have provided should no longer be relied upon 
we will report the attainment of milestones associated with initiating or completing clinical trials and submitting regulatory filings when they have occurred 
there have been a number of recent developments which have simplified our capital structure 
in november  we utilized funds set aside in a restricted account to repay in full our notes 
in february  we entered into agreements with the holders of shares of series e stock  or the holders  whereby the holders agreed to convert their series e stock into common stock 
in return  we agreed to pay a dividend of for each share of series e stock held by the holders and to lower the exercise price of the warrants held by the holders from to 
we expect to record a charge of approximately  to net loss attributable to common stockholders  as determined under the black scholes pricing model  in the first quarter of in connection with the re pricing of the warrants 
the holders were also granted preemptive rights with respect to up to of the next  raised by us in any private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the amount of the preemptive right was reduced to  in march following completion of a  private placement of common stock by us 
on february   our stockholders approved an amendment to the certificate of designations  rights and preferences of the series e stock  providing for the mandatory conversion of all outstanding shares of series e stock  upon the affirmative vote of of the outstanding shares of series e stock 
we issued  shares of common stock in connection with the conversion of the outstanding shares of the series e stock 
in february  we implemented a one for five reverse split of our common stock 
unless otherwise noted  data throughout this annual report on form k is adjusted to reflect that reverse stock split 
product development altropane is an imaging agent being developed for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes  or ps including parkinson s disease  or pd  and non ps in patients with tremor  and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  or adhd 
we completed an initial phase iii trial of altropane for use in differentiating ps movement disorders from non ps movement disorders 
in april  we reached an agreement with the fda regarding our protocol design for a new phase iii clinical trial of altropane for the differentiation of parkinsonian tremors from tremors due to other  non parkinsonian causes 
our second phase iii clinical trial is designed to distinguish ps from non ps in patients with tremors 
the trial will enroll subjects who have been referred to a neurology clinic with a diagnosis of tremor who have previously been diagnosed by a general practitioner or internist as having either a parkinsonian or non parkinsonian tremor 
each subject will then undergo an altropane spect scan prior to being diagnosed by an mds as having either a parkinsonian or non parkinsonian tremor 
the spect scans will be read blind by a panel of nuclear medicine physicians 
the results of the blinded reads will then be compared to the mds diagnosis for sensitivity and specificity 
the primary endpoint will be the confirmation of the hypothesis that the diagnostic accuracy of altropane is significantly superior to the diagnostic accuracy of the internist or general practitioner 
the diagnosis of a mds will be utilized as the gold standard 
because we have elected to pursue a single  large phase iii trial for this indication  rather than two smaller  replicate trials  the spa provides that the trial be powered to potentially achieve a p value of or less 
fda may require this level of statistical significance for the primary endpoint in order to achieve approvability 
we currently expect to enlist up to centers in the united states  most of which are university based  and to enroll a minimum of patients patients with parkinsonian tremors and patients with non parkinsonian tremors 
enrollment for this second phase iii trial is ongoing 
we believe that  if the endpoints are met and no significant safety concerns or protocol deviations occur  this phase iii trial could provide the basis for an nda submission and ultimate approval of altropane 
however  we can provide no assurance that the fda will not request additional clinical trial data or other regulatory information before it will accept an nda submission for altropane 
we are currently conducting our second phase ii trial of altropane for the diagnosis of adhd in adults using a simplified scanning procedure and algorithm adjustments 
patient enrollment in this trial has been constrained by our limited financial resources 
we do not expect to be able to accelerate enrollment in this trial until such time as we raise sufficient additional capital 
inosine is an axon sprouting factor which specifically promotes axon outgrowth in cns cells 
in july  we filed an ind application with the fda for the use of inosine to enhance motor function recovery after stroke 
the ind included data which assessed the toxicity of inosine administered via continuous infusion into the lateral ventricle of the brain in both rats and dogs in a manner identical to that proposed for our phase i clinical trial in the ind 
in september  we announced that we had received a written response to our inosine ind filing from the fda 
in its response  the fda placed our phase i study on clinical hold pending the submission of additional pharmacology and toxicology data 
we have submitted a letter to the fda stating our intention to perform this additional work and requesting confirmation that the submission of these data will be sufficient to remove the clinical hold and to initiate the phase i study 
on september   we held a teleconference call with the fda to clarify the fda s requests for additional data 
the fda advised us to conduct the reprocessing of brain tissue samples and specialized histological staining of the brain sections and to submit these data for their review 
we do not expect additional tissue analyses to yield evidence of toxicity  but there can be no assurance that will be the case 
we expect that the fda will finalize their review of the ind amendment within days of receipt of our complete response to the clinical hold letter 
we believe that if there are no further questions or comments by the fda after their review  our phase i study will be taken off clinical hold and we will be given clearance to proceed with our phase i trial 
there is no assurance that we will be taken off clinical hold or that the fda will not have further questions or concerns that will require  among other things  an additional response or preclinical studies to be preformed prior to initiating the phase i trial 
the proposed phase i study has been designed to enroll moderate to severe stroke patients 
the study design calls for a dose escalation of inosine given to three groups of stroke patients patients in each dose group 
the highest dose given will be the estimated human equivalent of the effective dose given to rats 
all patients will be maintained on their initial dose of inosine for the full study period 
inosine will be administered via an implantable subcutaneous pump and icv catheter system that potentially allows the patient to leave the hospital at the same approximate time that they otherwise would have after such a stroke 
in addition to safety monitoring  efficacy monitoring will also be performed  but the small number of patients and the short duration of treatment will probably preclude statistically valid efficacy conclusions to be drawn 
it is expected that formal efficacy testing will be the purpose of a phase ii trial  which will follow the phase i trial if there are no significant safety concerns raised by the phase i trial 
our earlier stage product candidates include o for the treatment of pd  fluoratec  a second generation imaging agent for the diagnosis of pd and adhd  and troponin  our anti angiogenic agent 
the troponin program is focused on developing therapeutics to prevent the growth and spread of a number of cancers 
the program does not fall within our current strategic focus on developing diagnostics and therapeutics for cns diseases 
therefore  we are currently exploring our strategic alternatives related to this program including  but not limited to  terminating further development 
to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products and  with the exception of altropane  all of our technologies and early stage product candidates are in pre clinical development 
our product candidates must undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process which includes extensive pre clinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy before any resulting product can be marketed 
the fda has stringent laboratory and manufacturing standards which must be complied with before we can test our product candidates in humans or make them commercially available 
pre clinical testing and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive and the historical rate of failure for product candidates is high 
clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment which is a function of many factors  and delays and difficulties in completing patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
the foregoing uncertainties and risks limit our ability to estimate the timing and amount of future costs that will be required to complete the clinical development of each program 
in addition  we are unable to estimate when material net cash inflows are expected to commence as a result of the successful completion of one or more of our programs 
however  we do not currently expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next three years 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are dominated by larger  more experienced and better capitalized companies 
any delays we encounter in completing our clinical trial programs may adversely impact our competitive position in the markets in which we compete 
such delays may also adversely affect our financial position and liquidity 
following is information on the direct research and development costs incurred on our principal scientific technology programs currently under development 
these amounts do not include research and development employee and related overhead costs which total approximately million on a cumulative basis 
program th quarter year ended december  cumulative diagnostic imaging anti angiogenesis cns regeneration other estimating costs and time to complete development of a specific program or technology is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could require additional clinical trials or other development and testing 
results of any testing could lead to a decision to change or terminate development of a technology  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing or funding by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs incurred by us could be substantially less than estimated 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage technologies due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such technologies to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the cost and the date of completion for any technology that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty regarding the number of required trials  the size of such trials and the duration of development 
we currently expect our second phase iii clinical trial for altropane will cost approximately  more to complete 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not cost more to complete the current phase iii trial 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to marketable securities  research contracts  and the fair value and classification of equity instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
marketable securities our marketable securities consist exclusively of investments in united states agency bonds and corporate debt obligations 
these marketable securities are adjusted to fair value on the consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive income 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is considered to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to a new cost basis and the unrealized loss is removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary based on factors such as the significance of the decline  the duration of time for which the decline has been in existence and our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
to date  we have not recorded any other than temporary impairments related to our marketable securities 
these marketable securities are classified as current assets because they are highly liquid and are available  as required  to meet working capital and other operating requirements 
research contracts we regularly enter into contracts with third parties to perform research and development activities in connection with our scientific technologies 
costs incurred under these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract or based on actual enrollment levels which we believe corresponds to the manner in which the work is performed 
clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end as the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
fair value and classification of equity instruments historically  we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our debt and equity financings 
we record each of the securities issued on a relative fair value basis up to the amount of the proceeds received 
we estimate the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is dependent on a number of variables and estimates including interest rates  dividend yield  volatility and the expected term of the warrants 
our estimates are based on market interest rates at the date of issuance  our past history for declaring dividends  our stock price volatility and the contractual term of the warrants 
the value ascribed to the warrants in connection with debt offerings is considered a cost of capital and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt 
we have  at certain times  issued preferred stock and notes  which were convertible into common stock at a discount from the common stock market price at the date of issuance 
the discounted amount associated with such conversion rights represents an incremental yield  or beneficial conversion feature that is recorded when the consideration allocated to the convertible security  divided by the number of common shares into which the security converts  is below the fair value of the common stock at the date of issuance of the convertible instrument 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with the preferred stock is recognized as a return to the preferred shareholders and represents a non cash charge in the determination of net loss available to common stockholders 
the beneficial conversion feature is recognized in full immediately if there is no redemption date for the preferred stock  or over the period of issuance through the redemption date  if applicable 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with debentures  notes or other debt instruments is recognized as discount to the debt and is amortized as additional interest expense ratably over the remaining term of the debt instrument 
results of operations year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the higher net loss in was primarily due to higher research and development  general and administrative and interest expenses 
the lower net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in was primarily due to the absence in of a preferred stock beneficial conversation feature and an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares in  which was primarily the result of conversions of preferred stock into common stock in research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily attributable to higher pre clinical costs for inosine of approximately  associated with certain animal toxicology studies and higher clinical trial costs for altropane of approximately  related to the initiation of our second phase iii trial 
we currently anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase over the next twelve months although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
this expected increase is primarily related to costs associated with our second phase iii trial of altropane although we believe these increases may be offset  in part  by the absence of costs associated with the completion of the pre clinical program for inosine 
our current working capital constraints  and the results of our efforts to raise additional funds  may limit or significantly alter our planned expenditures 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily related to higher legal and consulting expenses of approximately  largely associated with a settlement and standstill agreement  or settlement agreement  we entered into on june  with robert l 
gipson  thomas o 
boucher  jr  ingalls snyder  llc and ingalls snyder value partners  lp under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid  to ingalls snyder  llc as reimbursement for certain expenses and approximately  in connection with consulting and separation agreements with our former chairman of the board of directors 
we also incurred corporate legal expenses of approximately  primarily in connection with the settlement agreement  including related litigation filed prior to execution of the settlement agreement 
this increase was partially offset by lower payroll costs in of approximately  due to lower headcount and lower patent related legal fees of approximately  we currently anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase over the next twelve months due to the hiring of our chief executive officer in september and our president and chief operating officer in november interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible senior secured promissory notes  or the notes  resulting from the beneficial conversion features recorded in fiscal in connection with our march private placement  the conversion price of the notes was reduced to per share in accordance with the anti dilution provisions of the notes creating beneficial conversion features of approximately  in june  we issued  in principal amount of notes for interest accrued through june  the  note was issued with a conversion price of which was below the market price of the common stock at the date of issuance resulting in a beneficial conversion feature of approximately  beneficial conversion features are recognized as a decrease in the carrying value of the notes and an increase in additional paid in capital 
during  we incurred approximately  in interest payable in cash on the coupon on the notes   in non cash interest primarily associated with the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes and  in amortization of debt issuance costs 
during the period  the notes bore an effective interest rate of approximately based on the fair value of the notes 
we currently anticipate that our interest expense will decrease over the next twelve months due to the prepayment of the notes in november interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a realized loss in the period of approximately  as compared to a realized gain of approximately  in accrual of preferred stock dividends was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  in december  we issued shares of series e stock with a purchase price of  per share of series e stock which initially yielded a cumulative dividend of per annum increasing to in june at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  for which a full valuation allowance has been established 
as a result of our concentrated efforts on research and development  we have a history of incurring net operating losses and expect to incur additional net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  therefore  we have provided a full valuation allowance for these assets 
in the event we achieve profitability  these deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expense  subject to limitations that may occur from ownership changes under provisions of the internal revenue code 
year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the lower net loss in was primarily due to lower research and development expenses and the absence in of certain non recurring equity related charges  partially offset by higher interest expense in the lower net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in was primarily due to an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares  which was primarily the result of a private placement of common stock completed in research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing development costs for troponin of approximately  lower manufacturing development and nda preparation costs for altropane for the diagnosis of ps of approximately  and lower pre clinical costs for earlier stage product candidates of approximately  during  our manufacturing efforts on troponin were focused on continuing work on the development of the manufacturing process whereas in such efforts were focused on refining the purification process and accumulating material for further pre clinical studies 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs of approximately  other expenses were zero during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was due to non cash charges related to agreements we entered into in and with significant securityholders to modify outstanding warrants 
in november  we agreed to extend the expiration date and lower the exercise price of certain warrants in return for the elimination of certain reset provisions of those warrants 
we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in related to this transaction 
in june  we agreed to issue additional warrants to a securityholder in return for a delay of the reset of the exercise price of certain warrants held by the securityholder 
we recorded charges of approximately  in both and related to this transaction 
the non cash charges recognized in each transaction were based upon a fair value calculation of the warrants modified or issued in each transaction as determined under the black scholes pricing model 
interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase was due to higher daily average balances in related to the notes which were issued in july  and therefore  outstanding for all of compared to less than half of during  we incurred approximately  in interest on the coupon on the notes   in non cash interest associated with the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes and  in amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates in  partially offset by higher average cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances and higher realized gains of approximately  in accrual of preferred stock dividends was  during the year ended december  as compared with none during the year ended december  in connection with the issuance of series e stock  we recorded a beneficial conversion feature of  during the year ended december  as compared to none during the year ended december  a beneficial conversion feature is recorded when the consideration allocated to the convertible security  divided by the number of common shares into which the security converts  is below the fair value of the common stock at the date of issuance of the convertible instrument 
the amount of the beneficial conversion feature has been immediately accreted and resulted in a deemed dividend as the preferred stock does not have a redemption term 
the value of the beneficial conversion feature has been reflected as an adjustment to the net loss attributable to common stockholders on the company s statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities  primarily related to our net loss  totaled  in as compared to  in the increase in is primarily related to higher research and development expenses in net cash provided by investing activities totaled  in as compared to net cash used for investing activities of  in the increase in net cash provided by investing activities principally reflects the decrease in restricted cash in and the purchase of marketable securities with the proceeds from the private placements  described below  completed by us in  net of the sales of marketable securities which were subsequently used to fund operations 
net cash used for financing activities totaled  in as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities principally reflects the effect of the payments of notes payable and preferred stock dividends paid by us in and the private placements  described below  completed by us in as of december   we have incurred total net losses since inception of approximately  to date  we have dedicated most of our financial resources to the research and development of our product candidates  general and administrative expenses and costs related to obtaining and protecting patents 
since inception  we have primarily satisfied our working capital requirements from the sale of our securities through private placements 
these private placements have included the sale of preferred stock and common stock  as well as notes payable and convertible debentures 
a summary of financings completed during the three years ended december  is as follows date net proceeds raised securities issued december million convertible preferred stock and warrants march million common stock july million convertible senior secured promissory notes and warrants march million common stock and warrants in the future  our working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development activities  the level of resources that we devote to the developmental  clinical  and regulatory aspects of our technologies  and the extent to which we enter into collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of approximately  and a working capital deficit of approximately  we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  will not provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december   combined with approximately  in net proceeds raised in a private placement of common stock completed in march   in net proceeds received through the exercise of certain warrants in february  and our ability to control certain costs  including those related to clinical trial programs  pre clinical activities  and certain general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through july we will need to raise additional capital in through a collaboration  merger or other transaction with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or through a debt financing or equity offerings by us in order to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december   are approximately as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations other contractual obligations other long term obligations reflected on the balance sheet total such amounts primarily include minimum rental payments for our office and laboratory leases in boston  massachusetts and baltimore  maryland 
the office and laboratory leases expire in and  respectively 
annual rent expense on the office and laboratory leases is approximately  and  respectively 
such amounts reflect accrued dividends on our series e stock 
on february   all shares of series e stock were converted into shares of our common stock 
such amounts primarily reflect research and development commitments with third parties 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payments fasb r 
fasb r revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
fasb r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation over the employees service period 
compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of certain conditions 
the fair value of an award is not re measured after its initial estimation on the grant date 
the statement is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r for all unvested stock options and restricted stock based upon the previously disclosed sfas methodology and amounts 
the retroactive methods would record compensation expense beginning with the first period restated for all unvested stock options and restricted stock 
we are evaluating if the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share 
we are also evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the method of adoption and we have not determined whether this adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
in note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the applicable securities and exchange commission rule during the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities in a variety of securities which can include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
the fair value of these available for sale securities are subject to changes in market interest rates and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
we may not have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore our future operating results or cash flows could be affected if we are required to sell investments during a period in which increases in market interest rates have adversely affected the value of our securities portfolio
