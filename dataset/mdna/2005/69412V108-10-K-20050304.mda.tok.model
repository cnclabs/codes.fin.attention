conversely  a decline in market interest rates would have a negative impact

planned expansion of new offices in the portland metropolitan area 
subsequent event subsequent to december   the bank entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a building and land in portland  oregon for a new office location 
this purchase is expected to close prior to the end of the first quarter at a total price of  the building will require substantial remodeling  and the new office is expected to open during the third quarter results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
two tables follow which analyze the change in net interest income for   and table i  average balance  analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
changes not solely due to volume or rate are allocated to rate 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points  from in to 
short term market interest rates were stable during the first six months of and were at a year low 
beginning on june   the federal reserve began to take measured steps to increase short term market rates during the last half of during the last half of  the short term market interest rates moved up on five occasions in basis point increments for a total increase of basis points 
during this period  the prime lending rate increased from to 
the bank s net interest margin did not immediately benefit from the increase in the prime rate as approximately  of the bank s variable rate loan portfolio had active floors above the calculated rate 
the basis point increase in the prime lending rate in november removed all active loan floors on variable rate loans 
as a result  the bank s net interest margin improved during the fourth quarter to 
that compares to net interest margins of   and for the first  second  and third quarters of  respectively 
interest and fees earned on earnings assets during increased by  or over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earnings asset volumes  which was partially offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning asset levels 
growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to loan growth as average loans net of the allowance for loan losses for the year were up  or over referring to table i  earning asset yields declined by basis points  from in to in yields on loans and securities available for sale contributed to the overall decline in earning asset yields during the yield on average loans  which make up of earning asset volumes  were primarily responsible for the decline in earning asset yields during loan yields for were  a decline of basis points from loan yields of recorded during the decline in loan yields is reflective of fixed rate loans booked during the prolonged low interest rate environment during the past two years  combined with active floors on variable rate loans above the calculated rate 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during increased by or over referring to table i  overall  average interest bearing liabilities in increased by  or over  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points from to 
referring to table ii interest expense increased by due to the change in the mix and increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
table i also indicates that interest expense for the year increased an additional due to rate as a result of the increase in short term market interest rates during the last half of table ii shows the increase in the volume and the increase in the rate on money market and now accounts were primarily responsible for the increased interest expense during referring to table i the average volume of money market and now accounts increased  or over  while the rate on these deposits increased basis points from in to in a portion of the increase in interest expense due to increased volume and rate of money market and now accounts was offset by a decline in volume and rate of time deposits 
referring to table i  average time deposits in were  or below and the rate paid on time deposits dropped by basis points from in to in table ii shows that the decline in volume and rate for the time deposit category reduced noninterest expense in by and  respectively  or a total of the decline in time deposit volume was primarily national time deposits that matured during and were not renewed 
the decline in the rate on time deposits is reflective of the lag effect on time deposit rates in a rising rate environment 
although market interest rates moved up during the last six months of the year  time deposit rates remained low as many of these deposits were booked during the prolonged low interest rate environment during and the first half of the company s net interest margin benefited from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year  average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over average nonninterest bearing deposits funded of total assets 
at december   total noninterest bearing deposits were  and accounted for of total outstanding deposits 
the bank s interest rate risk model indicates the bank is asset sensitive meaning that loans will reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities  thus in a rising interest rate environment  the net interest margin will expand 
while short term interest rates increased basis points during the last half of and are expected to continue to increase during the first half of  long term interest rates have remained stable creating a flattening of the yield curve 
at december   the bank has approximately  of variable rate loans approximately of the total loan portfolio  none with active floors  which will reprice immediately with any increase in short term market interest rates 
however  maturing fixed rate loans during will continue to reprice at relatively low yields as long term interest rates have not moved upward in tandem with short term rates 
in addition  approximately  of the bank s money market and now accounts are tied to the day treasury bill 
the day treasury bill rate has been moving in advance of increases in the fed funds rate  which increases the bank s cost of funds in advance of increases in the prime lending rate 
considering these factors  the bank s net interest margin is expected to decline in the first quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of  but should stabilize or improve as historically lower cost core deposits grow and stabilize or lower the bank s cost of funds 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points  from in to in market interest rates were at a year low for most of short term market rates were relatively stable for most of  with the exception of a basis point drop in short term rates  which lowered the overnight fed funds borrowing rate and the prime lending rate in june as a result of the drop in the prime lending rate in june   the company experienced compression of its net interest margin during the last half of the year 
the net interest margin averaged for the first six months of as compared to for the last six months of during  earning asset yields declined as new loans were booked at low interest rates and existing loans repriced or renewed at lower interest rates  while the company s cost of funds remained relatively stable 
the stability in the company s cost of funds was due to deposits  specifically interest checking  savings  and money market accounts  which were priced at their practiical floors in the low interest rate environment 
the high level of liquidity during the last six months of also negatively impacted the company s net interest margin for the year 
during the last six month of  the company had excess funds averaging  which were sold overnight or placed in short term investments 
these short term investments had an average yield of approximately  which lowered earning asset yields in the last half the year  contributing to some of the margin compression 
interest and fees earned on earnings assets during increased by  or over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earnings asset volumes  which was partially offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning asset levels 
nearly all of the growth in earning assets was attributable to loan growth as average loans net of the allowance for loan losses for the year were up  or over referring to table i  earning asset yields declined by basis points  from in to in yields on loans  short term investments  and securities available for sale contributed to the overall decline in earning asset yields during the yield on average loans  which make up of earning asset volumes  were primarily responsible for the decline in earning asset yields during loan yields for were  a decline of basis points from loan yields of recorded during the decline in loan yields is reflective of the basis point decline in market rates in june  which lowered yields on existing loan clients  and new loans booked throughout lower interest rates 
at december   the company had approximately  in variable rate loans or of the total loan portfolio 
approximately  of variable rate loans had active interest rate floors at december  the high level of variable rate loans and the maturity structure of the company s liabilities  make the company asset sensitive  meaning that its loans will reprice faster than liabilities as interest rates change 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during decreased by or from referring to table i  interest expense increased by due to increased volumes  which was more than offset by a  decline in interest expense due to lower rates 
table ii shows that average interest bearing liabilities for increased by  or over  which increased interest expense for the year 
most of the increase in volume was attributable to growth in money market and now accounts 
rates paid on interest bearing liabilities fell basis points  from in to in rates on every category of interest bearing liabilities showed a decline in when compared to the company s net interest margin benefited from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year  average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over average nonninterest bearing deposits funded of total assets 
at december   total noninterest bearing deposits were  and accounted for of total outstanding deposits

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled in  in  and  in the lower provision for reflects improved credit quality in the bank s loan portfolio and reduction in the level of nonperforming assets throughout the year 
the large provision in reflected identified risks in the company s loan portfolio and a general decline in economic conditions  which specifically affected the hotel motel industry 
loan losses in the hotel motel industry in included  related to two borrowers 
nonperforming assets at december  were  or of year end assets 
that compares to  of nonperforming assets at december  or of year end assets 
at december   the bank has a single commercial real estate property in foreclosed assets with a value of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans at december  was  of outstanding loans compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
at december   the bank also reserved for possible losses on unfunded loan commitments  which is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
at december   the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans was of the total nonperforming loans compared to at year end december  the ending allowance includes in specific allowance for impaired loans 
at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees consisting of one restructured and performing loan of  and of nonaccrual loans 
subsequent to the end of the year  the  restructured and performing impaired loan commenced to amortize at market interest rates and will no longer be classified as restructured or impaired as of the end of first quarter this loan had a specific allowance of at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees with a specific allowance assigned of net loan charge offs were in compared to in  and  in net charge offs during in the hotel motel industry accounted for  or of total charge offs for the year and related to two borrowers in the hotel motel industry 
the reduction in the provision when compared to was accomplished despite significant growth in the loan portfolio and reflected improved credit quality and reductions in nonperforming loans 
going forward into  the provision for loans losses will be more contingent on current economic and market conditions and additional loan growth as there is only limited benefit available from further improvement in the loan portfolio credit statistics 
as a result  management expects the provision for loan losses to increase in when compared to actual results may differ materially from projections 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for estimated loan losses in the portfolio at year end based on management s assessment of various factors including present past due and impaired loans  past history and loss experience  loan concentrations in specific industries  and current economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
compared to noninterest income in was  down or from year the decline in noninterest income was attributable to two categories 
mortgage banking income and gains on sales of loans in decreased or from the previous year 
mortgage banking revenues accounted for of the decline in this category as higher long term interest rates significantly reduced the level of refinancing 
gains on the sales of loans were down during  the bank recorded a one time gain on sales of loans of there were no loan sales during in addition to the decline in mortgage banking revenues and gains on sales of loans  the bank s loan servicing income decreased by due to an overall decline in the level of participated loans 
declines in these two noninterest income categories was partially offset by a or increase in other fee income  principally merchant bankcard processing revenues 
compared to noninterest income in was  up or over year the majority of growth in noninterest income was attributable to three categories 
service charges on deposit accounts were up or due to an increase in the number of clients  increased fees on analyzed business accounts  and price increases on nsf od fees that went into effect during april other fee income  principally merchant bankcard processing fees grew by or over during  the company converted to a new third party processor for its merchant bankcard processing 
during the conversion process  revenue growth slowed as processing was temporarily being handled by two different processors  which increased interchange paid processing expense 
mortgage banking noninterest income and gains on sales of loans totaled  in compared to for  an improvement of or 
revenues from the originations of residential mortgages accounted for of the increase as long term interest rates fell sharply during creating a surge in new home sales and refinancing of existing mortgages 
gains on the sales of loans in were  up from the reported in growth in these noninterest income categories was partially offset by a decline in loan servicing income and a decline in gains on sales of securities 
the decline in loan servicing income was due to an overall decline in the level of sold loans 
in addition  the early payoff of a participated loan resulted in a write down of of a previously recorded servicing asset 
noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than the provision for loan losses and interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
compared to noninterest expense in was  an increase of or over the same period in comparing to  the largest increase was in personnel expense  which grew by  or over the previous year  reflecting personnel costs for staff added during the last half and and increased group insurance expense 
staff additions were primarily related to expansion in the portland market 
increased salaries  incentive compensation  k contribution and payroll taxes accounted for of the increase in personnel expense for the year when compared to increased group insurance costs  primarily medical insurance  accounted for of the total increase in personnel expense 
for the year  group insurance expense was above the previous year for the same period 
business development expense in was  a or increase as the bank s new branding campaign was implemented during the year 
growth in these noninterest expense categories was offset by a decrease in other real estate expense 
other real estate expense in declined by approximately as included expenses related to write downs and operating losses associated with motel and hotel properties which were sold during during  the company incurred incremental expenses totaling  primarily in the fourth quarter  related to compliance with section of sarbannes oxley in terms of software  audit fees and professional consulting services 
the incremental expense related to compliance with section does not include substantial staff time spent on this project 
for  the company expects the rate of expense growth to increase relative to due to planned staff increases  expansion plans in the portland market  and increase audit fees and professional services 
compared to noninterest expense in was  up  or over three categories of expenses accounted for  of the total expense increase for the year 
salaries accounted for of the increase 
however  salaries in reflect one time executive severance expense of excluding this one time expense from  salaries were up or over last year and reflect staff additions during the last half of and the first half of  primarily related to expansion in the portland area market 
commissions paid to residential mortgage and construction lenders were up over due to the higher volume of activity during benefits and taxes in increased by over approximately of the increase was due to incentive based compensation accruals  including the bank s estimated k contribution 
for the year  the bank s incentive based compensation and k match were significantly diminished as key financial goals were not met for the year 
the remainder of the increase in benefits and taxes resulted from increased group insurance costs and payroll taxes 
premises and equipment expense in were up or over expense related to premises accounted for of the increase and reflected increased lease costs of the bank s koin center office opened earlier this year 
in addition  lease costs on the coos bay office of the consumer finance division and increased lease costs on one of the bank s eugene offices contributed to the increase 
equipment expense accounted for of the increase and includes costs related to the portland area market expansion and increased software maintenance expense on the bank s loan processing systems 
the other expense category of noninterest expense was  for  an increase of  or over other real estate expense related to operations and sales of three motel properties during accounted for of the increase in the other expense category 
in addition  repossession and collection expense related to problem loans accounted for of the increase 
most of the remaining increase in the other expense category was in professional services  which was up in compared to the professional services category includes legal fees  accounting fees  insurance expense  and consulting expenses 
liquidity liquidity is the term used to define the company s ability to meet its financial commitments 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity primarily through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits 
additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits compared to at december  loan growth during significantly outpaced the growth in core deposits 
outstanding loans grew by  during or  while core deposits grew by  or 
loan growth during the first half of was primarily funded by reducing overnight fed funds sold and core deposit growth 
during the last six months of  the company relied on alternative funding sources  including overnight borrowed funds  federal home loan bank term advances  public deposits available from the state of oregon  and national market time deposits 
the company has deposit relationships with several large clients  which are closely monitored by bank officers 
at december   seven large deposit relationships with the bank account for  or of total deposits 
the single largest client represented of total deposits at december  the loss of this deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company expects to maintain these relationships and believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity to mitigate the loss of one or more of these clients 
borrowing lines have been established at various correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of seattle and with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
at year end december   the bank had borrowing lines totaling approximately  consisting of  with the federal home loan bank of seattle   with various correspondent banks  and  with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the federal home loan bank borrowing line is limited to the amount of collateral pledged 
at december   the bank had approximately  in commercial real estate loans pledged as collateral discounted collateral value of  for this line 
the  borrowing line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco is also secured 
the  in borrowing lines with correspondent banks are unsecured lines 
at december   the bank had  in borrowings outstanding and approximately  available on established lines 
in addition  the bank is part of the state of oregon community bank time deposit program and at december  had  available from this source 
the bank s loan portfolio also contains approximately  in guaranteed government loans  which can be sold on the secondary market 
capital resources capital is the shareholder s investment in the company 
capital grows through the retention of earnings and the issuance of new stock through the exercise of incentive options 
capital formation allows the company to grow assets and provides flexibility in times of adversity 
banking regulations require the company to maintain minimum levels of capital 
the company manages its capital to maintain a well capitalized designation the fdic s highest rating 
at december   the company s total capital to risk weighted assets was  compared to at december  in september  the company paid a for stock split to shareholders of record at october  all per share data and outstanding shares from prior periods has been restated to present consistent financial information 
the company pays cash dividends on a quarterly basis  typically in march  june  september and december of each year 
the board of directors considers the dividend amount quarterly and takes a broad perspective in its dividend deliberations including a review of recent operating performance  capital levels  and growth projections 
the board also considers dividend payout ratios  dividend yield  and other financial metrics in setting the quarterly dividend 
adjusting for the september stock split  the company declared and paid cash dividends of per share for the year that compares to cash dividends of paid during  also adjusted for the stock split 
the company projects that earnings retention and existing capital will be sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth  while maintaining a well capitalized designation from the fdic 
critical accounting policies companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its only material critical accounting policy to be the allowance for loans losses for outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
the allowance for outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at the amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations  or liquidity 
inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
a more reasonable approach utilizes gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time to determine the effect on the company s net interest income 
the company utilizes the services of the federal home loan bank s asset liability modeling software to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
the more realistic forecast assumes a gradual interest rate movement of plus or minus basis points change in the federal funds rate over a one year period of time with rates moving up or down basis points each quarter 
the model used is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
during  the model indicated that the company continued to be asset sensitive and projects rising margins in a rising rate environment and declining margins in a falling rate environment 
the following tables show the estimated impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
tables show results of company supplied data for both the rate shock and gradual interest rate scenarios 
the base figure of  used in both analyses represents actual net interest income for the year due to the various assumptions used for this modeling  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results 
interest rate shock analysis net interest income and market value performance in thousands projected net interest income interest estimated change change rate change value from base from base base gradual interest rate movement forecast net interest income and market value performance in thousands projected net interest income interest estimated change change rate change value from base from base rising base declining off balance sheet contingencies in the normal course of business  the bank commits to extensions of credit and issues letters of credit 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend funds and conditional obligations as it does for other credit products 
in the event of nonperformance by the customer  the bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract 
since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december   the bank had  in commitments to extend credit 
letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
at december   the bank had  in letters of credit and financial guarantees written 
subsequent to december   the bank entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a building and land in portland  oregon for a new office location 
this purchase is expected to close prior to the end of the first quarter at a total price of  the building will require substantial remodeling  and the new office is expected to open during the third quarter the company has entered into employment agreements with two key executives  hal brown and daniel hempy 
the agreements provide for a minimum aggregate annual base salaries of  plus performance adjustments  life insurance coverage  and other perquisites commonly found in such agreements 
during  mr 
brown s contract was extended one year and expires in mr 
hempy s agreement expires in
