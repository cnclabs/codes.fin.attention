the primary factors of improved working capital are favorable changes to accounts receivable million and in inventory million 
in  inventories rose approximately million over levels 
inventory levels are million below year end levels 
these positive impacts were offset somewhat by an unfavorable change million in payables and accrual balances resulting from generally lower costs and expenses coupled with the timing of merchandise purchases

however  the company s decisions to discontinue its crossing pointe catalog title in and to phase out the allegheny trail wholesale business by april  have created the need to reserve a greater portion of these inventories due to anticipated lower recovery

the company s senior financial management and the company s auditors ernst young review the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company s revenue recognition policy is as follows sales cash  blair credit  or third party credit card are recorded when the merchandise is shipped to the customer in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
finance charges on time payment accounts are recognized on an accrual basis of accounting 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and related items  provision for doubtful accounts and blair credit  are discussed in results of operations  liquidity and sources of capital and future considerations

based on the company s level of credit sales and finance charges  net income would change by approximately million  or 
per share  from a one percentage point change in the bad debt rate 
the allowance for returns is recorded as an offset against customer accounts receivable

at december   the company had total net current deferred tax assets of million 
these assets relate principally to asset valuation reserves including bad debts  returns and inventory obsolescence 
based on recent historical earnings performance and current projections  management believes that a valuation allowance is not required against these deferred tax assets  except for the valuation allowances against state net operating losses and the allegheny trail inventory obsolescence reserve 
the state net operating loss valuation allowance was provided due to its uncertainty of realization based upon the state s net operating loss carryforward rules 
the allegheny trail inventory obsolescence reserve valuation allowance was provided due to the company s decision to phase out this business by april  impact of inflation and changing prices although inflation has moderated in our economy  the company is continually seeking ways to cope with its impact

under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces distortion in reported income due to increasing costs

the elimination of this quota will result in lower priced textile products from most of the world trade member countries 
because some member countries did not charge for quota  not all products will experience lower costs 
however  in most world trade member countries  lower prices are anticipated to range between and  depending on the item and the country of origin 
these lower prices will result in lower landed duty paid prices for american importers 
china is the only world trade organization member country that could be required to have quotas reinstated if their imports exceed a set amount per category 
property  plant and equipment are continuously being expanded and updated 
major projects are discussed under liquidity and sources of capital 
assets acquired in prior years will be replaced at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
new assets  when acquired  will result in higher depreciation charges  but in many cases  due to technological improvements  savings in operating costs should result 
the charges to operations for depreciation represent the allocation of historical costs incurred over past years and are significantly less than if they were based on the current cost of productive capacity being used

however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption
