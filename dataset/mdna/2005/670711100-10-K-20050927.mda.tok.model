item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
effective june   we changed our fiscal year end from december to june accordingly  the following discussion provides information with respect to our results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources on a comparative basis for the years ended june  and and for the years ended june  as compared june  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
we had two business segments for the years ended june   and pharmacy drug store chain pharmacies and wholesale and retail sales of medical equipment and supplies medical 
we have discontinued our operations of our wholesale and retail distribution of equipment  supplies  and novelty items to emergency medical service  fire departments  and police departments fire and police 
business segments are determined by the management approach which analyzes results based on products or services offered for sale 
year ended june  compared to june  net sales 
total sales for the twelve months ended june  decreased by 
from june  to  from  in the following table shows sales by business segment for the years ended june  and business segment increase decrease pharmacies   
medical   total for business segments   the pharmacies segment s sales decreased  to  or 
for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the main reason for the decrease was the impact of a renegotiation of an expired contract with one federally qualified health center fqhc  withdifferent terms and conditions  from a replenishment model to a segregated inventory model 
under the former contract  the pharmacies dispensed prescrip tions from its inventory and recognized as sales the gross value of the prescription dispensed 
under the latter contract  the pharmacies dispensed prescriptions from a segregated inventory owned by the fqhc and recognized as revenues the dispensing fee paid it by the fqhc 
the remaining contract for the fqhcs are still under the replenishment model 
the dispensing fees totaled approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to approximately  for the year ended june  had the previous replenishment model and corresponding revenue recognition been employed  additional sales of approximately  would have been recognized for the year ended june  as compared to an additional sales of approximately  for the year ended june  as such  pharmacies sales would have been approximately  or an increase of approximately for the year ended june  management expects prescriptions to increase due to an aging population  increased medicare prescription benefits and additional prescription drugs coming to market point to increasing the prescription drug market 
the pharmacies segment s same store sales growth have recently slowed as the total number of prescriptions dispensed within the united states remained relatively constant and many pharmacy benefit management companies pbm s increased the percentage of prescription insurance plans with a required mail order component 
management plans are to mitigate the effects of mandatory mail order components within the prescription insurance plans by continuing to seek niches within the market that it is uniquely qualified to service 
in late november of  the pharmacy segment opened a new location within a medical center in waltham  ma  which was recently acquired by boston children s hospital 
management expects that its presence within this unique medical community will result in added sales volume and incremental profits 
the medical segment s sales decreased  in to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year june  over  was due to increased pressure from regional and national buying groups which are able to command larger discounts from manufacturers and are able to offer on line purchasing and inventory controls 
also  increased pressure continues from larger competitors who offer lower prices 
in addition  physicians and physician groups are being purchased by hospitals which require they purchase from their sources resulting in a decrease of  the balance is due to new buying groups offering lower prices to induce customers to purchase their products and not selling products with very low gross profit margins 
internet sales increased approximately  which helped offset the decline

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrinkage  impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables we maintain a reserve for the amount of receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is estimated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventories included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrinkage  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we considered historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates upon which that our reserves were based  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by estimating the expected future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and comparing this amount to the carrying value 
goodwill impairment in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our tests during the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our companies 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes the company concluded  based on available evidence  it is uncertain when the company will utilize the other deferred tax assets  principally timing difference relating to allowances  depreciation and intangible assets  and  therefore it is more likely than not that the timing difference will not be utilized and a valuation allowance has been provided 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment which requires companies to record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees at an amount determined by the fair value of the options 
sfas no 
r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  as such  effective with the company s first fiscal quarter of  sfas no 
r will eliminate the company s ability to account for stock options using the method permitted under apb and instead require recognition of compensation expense should the company issue stock options to its employees or non employee directors 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact adoption of sfas no 
r will have on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity that  under previous pronouncements  issuers could account for as equity 
the new accounting guidance contained in sfas no 
requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in the balance sheet 
sfas no 
affects the issuer s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments 
one type is mandatorily redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets 
a second type includes put options and forward purchase contracts  which involves instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets 
the third type of instruments that are liabilities under this statement is obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuers shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety 
most of the provisions of sfas no 
are consistent with the existing definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
the remaining provisions of this statement are consistent with the fasb s proposal to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own shares 
this statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the company s financial position or the results of its operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory cost an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoiage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this standard is issued 
the provisions of sfas no 
must be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued seas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no  accounting for non monetary transactions 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets  which were previously required to be recorded on a carryover basis rather than a fair value basis 
instead  this statement provides that exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance be reported at carryover basis rather than a fair value basis 
a non monetary exchange is considered to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company expects to adopt the standard during the fiscal year the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and has not determined the impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections which provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and correction of errors 
this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
cash 
our cash is in checking accounts 
since these accounts are non interest bearing  there are no risks to us for fluctuating interest rates 
debt our debt is not subject to market risk and fluctuations because all of the debt has fixed maturity dates and fixed interest rates 
the difference between the company s carrying amount and fair value of its long term debt was immaterial at june   and
