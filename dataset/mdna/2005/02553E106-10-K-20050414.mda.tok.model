item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
restatement of prior financial information on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in light of this letter  the company s management initiated a review of its lease related accounting and determined that its historical method of accounting for rent holidays and tenant allowances  as more fully described below  was not in accordance with gaap 
as a result  the company restated its previously filed consolidated financial statements for the years ended january  and february  the company also restated its quarterly financial information for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  as shown in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the restatement also affects periods prior to fiscal the impact of the restatement on prior periods has been reflected as a cumulative adjustment of million to retained earnings as of february  in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
historically  the company has recognized straight line rent expense for leases beginning on the store opening date 
this had the effect of excluding the build out period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expenses rent and recognizes construction allowances 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  the company is now changing this practice to include the build out period in the calculations of rent expense and construction allowance amortization 
additionally  in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  the company is changing its classification of construction allowances on its consolidated financial statements to record them as deferred liabilities  which will be amortized as a reduction to rent expense 
furthermore  construction allowances will be presented within operating activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows 
historically  construction allowances have been classified on the company s consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of property and equipment and the related amortization had been classified as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the lesser of the useful life or the life of the lease on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s consolidated statements of cash flows have historically reflected construction allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within investing activities 

table of contents the company did not amend its previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement 
accordingly  the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
all referenced amounts for prior periods in this annual report on form k are presented on a restated basis 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company records revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
the company s e commerce operation records revenue at the time the goods are shipped 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of sales returns 
revenue is not recorded on the sell off of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise to off price retailers 
these sell offs are typically sold below cost and the proceeds are reflected in cost of sales 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear merchandise 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
the company also estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
asset impairment 
the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
management evaluates the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
assets are evaluated for impairment when undiscounted future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of those assets 
when events such as these occur  the assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes 
the company calculates income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 

table of contents legal proceedings and claims 
the company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the conduct of its business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  management records a reserve for estimated losses when the amount is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if a range of possible loss exists  the company records the accrual at the low end of the range  in accordance with fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
as the company has provided adequate reserves  it believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the company 
self insurance reserve 
the company is self insured for certain losses related to employee medical benefits 
costs for self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based on known claims and historical experience 
management believes that it has adequately reserved for its self insurance liability  which is capped through the use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies 
however  any significant variation of future claims from historical trends could cause actual results to differ from the accrued liability 
key performance indicators management of the company evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing the company s performance comparable store sales a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of the company s current performance 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of costs while negative comparable store sales contribute to deleveraging of costs 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on the company s total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether the company is appropriately optimizing the price of its merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consists of compensation and travel for our buyers  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  and compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in the company s use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on the company s gross profit and results of operations 
operating income management views operating income as a key indicator of the company s success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit and the company s ability to control operating costs 
store productivity store productivity  including sales per square foot  average unit retail price  number of transactions per store  number of units sold per store and number of units per transaction  is evaluated by management in assessing the operational performance of the company 
inventory turnover management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of the company s cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover the company s uses of cash 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements

see note of the consolidated financial statements and part iii  item of this form k for additional information regarding related party transactions 
income taxes as of january   the company had deferred tax assets of million associated with canadian tax loss carryforwards 
we anticipate that future taxable income in canada will be sufficient to utilize the full amount of the deferred tax assets 
assuming a effective tax rate  we will need to recognize pretax net income of approximately million in future periods to realize this deferred tax asset 
for the year ended january   a valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax asset that resulted from a capital loss carryforward in the amount of million 
management believes that it is no longer more likely than not that the previously identified tax strategies will enable the company to utilize the capital loss carryforward prior to its july expiration date

table of contents safe harbor statement  seasonality and risk factors this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of approximately to american eagle stores in the us and canada in fiscal  the selection of approximately american eagle stores in the us for remodeling or refurbishment in fiscal  the possibility of growth through acquisitions and or internally developing new brands  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  and the expected completion of our external trading partners security procedure validation process by the bureau of customs and border protection during we caution that these statements are further qualified by factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitation  the following our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to identify and respond to fashion trends in a timely manner 
the specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy and customer preferences  dictated by fashion and season 
these fluctuations especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers  since merchandise typically must be ordered well in advance of the selling season 
while we endeavor to test many merchandise items before ordering large quantities  we are still susceptible to changing fashion trends and fluctuations in customer demands 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the retail business requires that we carry a significant amount of inventory  especially during our peak selling seasons 
we enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of our private label apparel well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand  pricing shifts  and the timing and selection of merchandise purchases 
changes in fashion trends  if unsuccessfully identified  forecasted or responded to by the company  could  among other things  lead to lower sales  excess inventories and higher markdowns  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of competitive pressures from other retailers and other business factors the specialty retail industry is highly competitive 
the company competes primarily on the basis of quality  fashion  service  selection and price 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the future 
the success of the company s operations also depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment  consumer debt  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be negatively affected by general or local economic conditions  thereby adversely impacting the company s continued growth and results of operations 
our ability to grow through new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions the company s continued growth and success will depend in part on its ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis 
during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately to new american eagle stores in the us and canada
