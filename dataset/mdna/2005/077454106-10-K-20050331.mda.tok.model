during the five year period from through  the company s total revenues increased by from million to million 
this revenue comparison reflects two offsetting trends from through  companies selling products to the electronics and networking markets suffered through a significant downturn in demand 
much of this downturn could be attributed to the poor health of the general economies in both north america and europe during that period 
a majority of the company s revenues historically were derived from customers located in those regions 
the company began experiencing increased demand for its products in as the general economies of those two regions began to improve 
in  incremental revenues of million were generated due to the business combination discussed below 
business combination belden inc belden and cable design technologies corporation cdt entered into an agreement and plan of merger  dated february  the merger agreement pursuant to which belden merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of cdt the merger

in the event nortel was unable to pay these obligations  the company would be liable for all or most of such obligations 
management currently believes the probability that a loss will be incurred in connection with this site is remote 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to three sites designated for cleanup under cercla or similar state laws  which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages without regard to fault or the legality of waste generation or disposal 
persons liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although cercla imposes joint and several liability on all prps  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
settlements can often be achieved 
table of contents through negotiations with the appropriate environmental agency or the other prps 
prps that contributed less than of the waste are often given the opportunity to settle as de minimis parties  resolving their liability for a particular site 
the number of sites with respect to which the company has been identified as a prp has decreased in part as a result of de minimis settlements 
belden cdt does not own or operate any of the three waste sites with respect to which it has been identified as a prp 
in each case  belden cdt is identified as a party that disposed of waste at the site 
with respect to two of the sites  belden cdt s share of the waste volume is estimated to be less than 
at the third site  belden contributed less than of the waste 
although no estimates of cleanup costs have yet been completed for these sites  the company believes  based on its preliminary review and other factors  including belden cdt s estimated share of the waste volume at the sites  that the costs relating to these sites will not have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company has recorded an accrued liability on the consolidated balance sheet to the extent such costs are known and estimable for such sites 
the company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  provincial  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations  or cleanup costs at the facilities and sites discussed above 
however  some risk of environmental liability and other costs is inherent in the nature of our business  and there can be no assurance that material environmental costs will not arise 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  could lead to material costs of environmental compliance and cleanup by the company

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations  the effects of these accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statement and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the accounting policies described below to be its most critical accounting policies 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company believes these judgments have been materially accurate in the past and the basis for these judgments should not change significantly in the future 
the 
table of contents company s senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in the period title to product passes to customers and collectibility of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
as part of the revenue recognition process  the company determines whether the resulting accounts receivable are reasonably assured of collection based on a variety of factors  including an evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of its customers  which could result in the company being unable to collect the accounts receivable 
in situations where it is unclear as to whether the company will be able to sell or collect the accounts receivable  the company will request alternative financing arrangements  such as prepayment or commercial letters of credit  from the customer 
sales incentive  product price protection and returned material allowances the company grants incentive allowances to selected customers as part of its sales programs 
the incentives are determined based on certain targeted sales volumes 
in certain instances  the company also grants selected product price protection allowances 
certain distribution customers are also allowed to return inventory at the customer s original cost  in an amount not to exceed three percent of the prior year s purchases  in exchange for an order of equal or greater value 
sales revenues are reduced when incentives  allowances or returns are anticipated or projected 
the company reduces revenues by recording a separate deduction in gross revenues 
the company follows guidance provided by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
future market conditions and product transitions might require the company to take actions to increase customer incentive and product price protection offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive or allowance is offered 
additionally  certain incentive programs require the company to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company recognized incentive allowances totaling million  million and million as a deduction in gross revenues in  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the specific identification method 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of accounts receivable  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of the accounts receivable  the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  the company may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a customer s inability or unwillingness to pay outstanding amounts  the company records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to its estimated collectible balance 
there have been occasions over the past decade where the company recognized an expense associated with the rapid collapse of a distributor for which no specific reserve had been previously established 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to the company and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
the company recognized bad debt expense of million  million and million as a component of operating expenses in  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents inventory allowances the company evaluates the realizability of its inventory on a product by product basis in light of anticipated sales demand  technological changes  product life cycle  component cost trends  product pricing and inventory condition 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition or where inventory cost exceeds net realizable value  the company records a charge to cost of goods sold and reduces the inventory to its net realizable value 
revisions to these inventory adjustments would be required if any of the factors mentioned above differed from the company s estimates 
at december  and  the company had inventory allowances of million and million  respectively 
deferred tax assets the company recognizes deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  nol carryforwards and deductible temporary differences between taxable income loss on its income tax returns and income loss before income taxes under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
deferred tax assets generally represent future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in the company s consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company is required to estimate taxable income in future years or develop tax strategies that would enable tax asset realization in each taxing jurisdiction and use judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
the company revised during the estimate of its ability to benefit from deferred tax assets arising from its netherlands operations in light of the longer duration and greater strength of the cyclical down turn in the european economy than the company had previously envisioned and in light of the restructuring and severance costs associated with the synergy opportunities arising from the merger 
as a result  the company recorded an additional million valuation reserve during with respect to net operating losses generated in the netherlands 
as of december   the company had approximately million of deferred tax assets related in part to domestic and foreign loss carryforwards  net of valuation allowances totaling million 
the realization of these assets is partially based upon estimates of future taxable income 
based on these estimates  the company believes the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 
this determination was based on current projections of future taxable income when taking into consideration the potential limitations on the utilization of nol carryforwards imposed by section of the internal revenue code section 
section imposed limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its nol carryforwards if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
as a result of the most recent ownership change  the company believes that section will have little  if any  impact upon the utilization of its nol carryforwards 
the company s nol carryforwards totaled million in at december  unless otherwise utilized  nol carryforwards totaling million will expire in  nol carryforwards totaling million will expire in  nol carryforwards totaling million will expire between and  and nol carryforwards totaling million will expire between and nol carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period total million 
nol carryforwards are presented net of liabilities related to the tax sharing and separation agreement between the company and its former owner  cooper industries ltd 
income tax contingencies the company s effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant 
table of contents judgment is required in determining the company s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that the company s position may not be fully sustained 
to the extent the company was to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  there could be a material effect on the company s income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made 
valuation of long lived tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 the company reviews long lived tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets to determine whether an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company bases its evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets and any historical or future profitability measurements  as well as other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the company determines whether impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if impairment has occurred  the company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between a willing buyer and seller other than in a forced or liquidation sale and can be measured as the asset s quoted market price in an active market or  where an active market for the asset does not exist  the company s best estimate of fair value based on either discounted cash flow analysis or present value analysis 
the discounted cash flow analyses and present value analyses that the company uses to estimate the fair value of its long lived tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets  are dependent on a number of factors including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and the company s percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates  terminal growth rates and other variables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are not predictable with precision and therefore are inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates

in accordance with sfas no

this loss was reflected as other operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations for during  the company determined that asset groups within the north american operations of its former communications segment were impaired 
the company then estimated fair values using a variety of techniques including discounted cash flows and comparable market data 
assumptions utilized in estimating fair values under continued asset use included long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
comparable market data was obtained from appraisals and other third party valuation estimates 
the company determined that fair values of asset groups within the north american operations of its former communications segment were less than carrying amounts by million 
the company included this impairment charge in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for during  the company identified certain equipment in its german manufacturing facility in the electronics segment that would not be transferred to the company s other manufacturing facilities after the closure of the german manufacturing facility late in in accordance with sfas no

sfas no 
requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determines the fair value using the income approach 
under the income approach  the company calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill as a component of operating expenses 
the income approach  which the company uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
sfas no 
requires that an impairment test for an indefinite lived intangible asset not subject to amortization consist of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess

table of contents assets with their respective carrying values  the company determined that the carrying values of its indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization were recoverable at december  pension and other postretirement benefits the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions relate to discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates and other factors 
the company bases the discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high quality corporate long term bonds

long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
the company s health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the company s key assumptions are described in further detail in note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of the lesser of of the project benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets  amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
while the actual rate of return on plan assets over the past five years has been less than the assumed rate of return on plan assets  the company believes the assumed rate is a reasonable assumption for the long term performance of its plan assets 
business combination accounting the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method requires management to make significant estimates 
first  management must determine the cost of the acquired entity based on the fair value of the consideration paid or the fair value of the net assets acquired  whichever is more clearly evident 
this cost is then allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the merger consummation date 
in addition  management must identify and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
management utilized third party appraisals to assist in estimating the fair value of tangible pp e and intangible assets acquired
