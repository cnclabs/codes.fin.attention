item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading producer of factory built housing in the us as of january   we operated homebuilding facilities in states and two provinces in western canada 
as of january   our homes were sold through company owned sales centers in states  consisting of traditional locations and other sales locations 
our homes are also sold through approximately  independent sales centers across the us and western canada and directly to an estimated builders and developers 
approximately of the independent retailer locations were members of our champion home centers chc retail distribution network 
during the past five years  the manufactured housing industry has been negatively affected by limited availability of consumer financing and floor plan inventory financing  high levels of homes repossessed from consumers  tightened consumer credit standards  excessive inventories and an uncertain economic outlook 
since the beginning of  in an effort to limit losses and return to profitability we have closed  sold  or consolidated manufacturing facilities and approximately retail sales locations to eliminate under performing operations and rationalize our operations and capacity for industry conditions 
our pretax income from continuing operations in was million  an improvement of million over  of which million was related to additional charges in for goodwill impairment and restructurings 
in addition  our results for the year showed improvements in both the manufacturing and retail segments as compared to results  partly due to our restructuring actions in and prior years to eliminate under performing operations 
improvement in our manufacturing operations is also attributable to improved pricing and purchasing  as well as production efficiencies from operating many of our plants with stronger backlogs 
as a result of a rise in our share price  included in income from continuing operations in are charges totaling million for the change in estimated fair value of an outstanding common stock warrant for million shares  compared to million in during  we sold nine and closed retail sales centers 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we announced the closing of a homebuilding facility in boaz  alabama and the transfer of its business to an idle facility at another operation in alabama 
we also have an agreement to sell retail sales centers during the first half of as we continue to focus on our core manufacturing operations 
these closures and planned sales resulted in restructuring charges of million in  including million of non cash fixed asset impairment charges 
restructuring charges in also reflect a million reduction in closed plant warranty reserves due to better than expected experience 
interest expense in was million lower than in due to debt reduction 
during the year ended january   we continued to focus on improving our financial position and reducing debt 
we purchased and retired million of our senior notes in exchange for million shares of our common stock and million cash  resulting in a net pretax loss of million 
we also repaid a million industrial revenue bond 
since the beginning of  we have reduced indebtedness by more than million 
according to data reported by the ibts  us industry manufacturing shipments of hud code homes in were comparable to shipments in according to data reported by mhi  us industry manufacturing shipments of modular homes for the first nine months of increased from shipments in the comparable period 
we continue to focus on matching our manufacturing capacity and number of company owned retail sales centers to industry and local market conditions and improving or eliminating under performing manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers 
we continually review our manufacturing capacity and the number and locations of company owned retail sales centers and will make further adjustments as deemed necessary 
during  we plan to divest of most of our remaining traditional retail sales centers 
upon those planned divestitures  our ongoing retail operations will consist primarily of advantage homes  which currently operates sales offices specializing in selling homes into manufactured housing communities in california

 we performed a test for retail and manufacturing goodwill impairment using the income approach 
under this method  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
in applying this present value method  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
in applying the income approach  we assumed a cash flow period of five years  a discount rate of and a terminal value of five times the present value of the fifth year s estimated future cash flows 
the results of this impairment test indicated that retail goodwill had no value  resulting in a non cash  pretax impairment charge equal to the remaining balance of retail goodwill of million  which was recorded in the quarter ended september  
table of contents impairment charges in in the second quarter of  as a result of the closure of retail sales centers  we performed a test for goodwill impairment similar to that described above

hpfc 
hpfc stopped accepting new loan applications on july  and processed approved applications through september  see discussion above in results of operations versus contingent repurchase obligations we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
upon default by a retailer under a floor plan financing agreement subject to an associated repurchase agreement  the repurchase agreement generally requires the manufacturer to repurchase the loan or the home for the unpaid balance of the floor plan loan  subject to certain adjustments 
in the event of such repurchases  our loss is equal to the difference between the repurchase price and the net price we realize upon resale of the home  less any accrued volume rebates that will not be paid 
each quarter we review our contingent wholesale repurchase obligations to assess the adequacy of the reserve for repurchase losses 
this analysis is based on a review of current and historical experience  reports received from four of the primary national floor plan lenders that provide floor plan financing for approximately of our manufacturing sales  and information regarding the performance of our retailers obtained from our manufacturing facilities 
we do not have repurchase risk for cash sales and we do not always enter into repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders that provide financing for the balance of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers 
the estimated repurchase obligation is calculated as the total amount that would be paid upon the default of all of our independent retailers whose inventories are subject to repurchase agreements  without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased homes 
as of january   our largest independent retailer  a nationwide retailer  had approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for up to months from date of invoice 
as of january  our next largest independent retailers had an aggregate of approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for up to months from date of invoice  with individual amounts ranging from approximately million to million per retailer

during the first quarter of  wholesale repurchase reserves were increased million in connection with the extension of repurchase terms to months for certain national floor plan lenders and for the negative effects of market conditions on our largest independent retailer 
also during  we agreed to temporarily extend both repurchase terms and the timing of required principal curtailment payments by this independent retailer to certain floor plan lenders 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources unrestricted cash balances totaled million at january  during  net cash of million was used for operating activities  including million used to increase working capital 
during the period  accounts receivable increased by million due to seasonally low balances at january  inventories increased by million due  in part  to rising raw material commodity costs and expanded california retail operations 
accounts payable decreased by million partially due to revised payment terms in exchange for better pricing 
cash provided during the period included million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock  million from stock option exercises  million from the disposal of fixed assets  million from the sale of retail businesses  and million from decreases in restricted cash balances 
cash used during the period included million to reduce long term debt  primarily for retiring senior notes and an industrial revenue bond  and million for capital expenditures 
also during the period we purchased and retired million of senior notes in exchange for million shares of the company s common stock 
we have a committed million revolving credit facility for letters of credit and general corporate purposes which expires in january availability under this facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base calculation based on percentages of accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  and  if necessary  cash on deposit 
as of january   there were million of letters of credit issued under the facility and there were no borrowings outstanding 
we expect to continue to utilize this facility principally for letters of credit 
the facility contains financial covenants that become effective only in the event that our liquidity  as defined  falls below million 
these covenants include required earnings  as defined  of million and a required ratio of earnings to fixed charges  as defined  of to for each month period ending on a fiscal quarter 
for the twelve months ended january   our earnings  as defined  were million and our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to at january   our liquidity  as defined  was million  which was in excess of million such that these financial covenants were not in effect 
we expect to maintain liquidity at or in excess of the million threshold over the next twelve months 
we continuously evaluate our capital structure 
strategies considered to improve our capital structure include without limitation  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging  or otherwise retiring our outstanding indebtedness  restructuring of obligations  new financings  and issuances of securities  whether in the open market or by other means and to the extent permitted by our existing financing arrangements 
we evaluate all potential transactions in light of existing and expected market conditions 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
the debt incurrence covenant in the indenture governing the senior notes due currently limits additional debt to i a working capital line of credit up to a borrowing base equal to of otherwise unencumbered inventories and of otherwise unencumbered accounts receivable  ii warehouse financing meeting certain parameters up to million  iii other debt up to million  and iv ordinary course indebtedness and contingent obligations that includes non speculative hedging obligations  floor plan financing  letters of credit  surety bonds  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements related to retailer floor plan financing and guarantees of additional debt otherwise permitted to be incurred 
the resulting effect at january   when combined with limits in our senior notes due  was a working capital line of credit limit of approximately million of which no more than approximately million of cash borrowings could be secured debt  as defined 
we have two floor plan facilities with total availability of million  of which million was outstanding at january  a million floor plan financing facility contains a covenant requiring the maintenance of million of liquidity  as defined in the facility  at each fiscal month end 
if we were to be out of compliance with this covenant  the lender could terminate the credit line and cause the debt to become immediately due and payable 
as of january   we had approximately million outstanding under this facility and were in compliance with the covenant 
as is customary for these types of financings  both of these facilities may be cancelled by the lender with a day notice 
we expect to spend less than million in on capital expenditures 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near term 

table of contents contingent liabilities and obligations we had significant contingent liabilities and obligations at january   including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million and guarantees by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries of million of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
additionally  we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
we estimate our contingent repurchase obligation as of january  was approximately million  without reduction for the resale value of the homes 
see contingent repurchase obligations discussed above in item of this report 
we have provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of our business  in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements 
we are also subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent liabilities and obligations will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
summary of liquidity and capital resources at january   our unrestricted cash balances totaled million and we had unused availability of million under our two floor plan facilities 
therefore  total cash available from these sources was approximately million 
for the next two years  we expect cash flow from operating activities to fund capital expenditures 
in addition  we have less than million of scheduled debt payments due in and therefore  the level of cash availability is projected to be substantially in excess of cash needed to operate our businesses for the next two years 
in the event one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would revise our operating strategies accordingly

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax assets  and property  plant and equipment 
historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves  including reserves for self insured risks  warranty costs

under our current self insurance programs  we are generally responsible for up to  per claim for workers compensation  per claim in california and automobile liability claims  up to million per claim for product liability and general liability claims and up to million per claim for property insurance claims including business interruption losses 
we maintain excess liability and property insurance with independent insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
under our current self insurance program we are responsible for up to  of health insurance claims per contract per year 
estimated casualty and health insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors considered in estimating our insurance reserves are the nature of outstanding claims including the severity of the claims  estimated costs to settle existing claims  loss history and inflation  as well as estimates provided by our outside insurance broker and carrier  and third party actuaries 
significant changes in the factors described above could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
warranty reserves our manufacturing operations generally provide the retail homebuyer with a twelve month warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale 
our warranty reserve is based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing operations as of the balance sheet date 
factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty  including homes in retailer inventories and homes purchased by consumers still within the twelve month warranty period  and the historical average costs incurred to service a home 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
property  plant and equipment the recoverability of property  plant and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling prices  appraised values or projected undiscounted cash flows 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy and operating conditions 
additionally  we use estimates of fair market values to establish impairment reserves for permanently closed facilities that are held for sale 
past evaluations of property  plant and equipment have resulted in significant impairment charges primarily for closed manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers including charges in the fourth quarter of significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the requirements established in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recording of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we incurred significant pretax losses in through during through the manufactured housing industry and the company were challenged by limited availability of consumer and floor plan financing  high industry consumer repossession levels and an uncertain economic outlook  resulting in a continued decline in manufacturing shipments and retail sales 
after consideration of these factors  we provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in deferred tax assets will continue to require a valuation allowance until the company has demonstrated their realizability through sustained profitability and or from other factors 
the valuation allowance will be 
table of contents reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized as a reduction of taxes otherwise payable on any future earnings or a portion or all of the valuation allowance is otherwise no longer required 
goodwill remaining goodwill is related to our manufacturing operations 
we test for goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the fair value of our manufacturing segment versus its carrying value as of each fiscal year end or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
when estimating fair value  we calculate the present value of future cash flows based on forecasted sales volumes  the number of homebuilding facilities in operation  current industry and economic conditions  historical results and inflation 
past evaluations of goodwill have resulted in significant impairment charges for retail segment goodwill including charges in and significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or differences between estimates and actual results could result in impairment charges in the future 
wholesale repurchase reserves the majority of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with the providers of floor plan financing 
potential losses under repurchase obligations are determined by calculating the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes  less accrued rebates which will not be paid 
probable losses under repurchase agreements are accrued based on the historical number of homes repurchased  the cost of such repurchases and the historical losses incurred  as well as the current inventory levels held at our independent retailers 
in addition  we monitor the risks associated with our independent retailers and consider these risks in our evaluation of the wholesale repurchase reserves 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our operations during the last three years 
commodity prices  including lumber  fluctuate  however  during periods of rising commodity prices the company has generally been able to pass the increased costs to its customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our floor plan borrowings are subject to interest primarily based on the us prime interest rate  although certain of the floor plan borrowings are subject to a minimum rate of interest  which is greater than the current prime rate 
without consideration of the minimum rate of interest on certain of the floor plan borrowings  a basis point increase in the prime rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  assuming average floor plan borrowings of million  the amount of outstanding borrowings at january  in addition  we have obligations under industrial revenue bonds that are subject to variable interest rates tied to short term tax exempt rate indices which averaged in a basis point increase in this interest rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  based on the million of debt outstanding under industrial revenue bonds at january
