item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future uncertainties the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve material risks and uncertainties 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with a warning about forward looking statements on page of this annual report 
our discussion of the financial condition and results of operation of quidel corporation in this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive summary we enjoy a worldwide leadership position in the development  manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic solutions at the poc in infectious diseases and reproductive health 
we focus on poc testing solutions specifically developed for the physician office lab and acute care markets globally 
we primarily earn revenue from product sales to professionals for use in physician offices  hospitals  clinical laboratories and wellness screening centers 
we market our products in the us through a network of national and regional distributors  supported by a direct sales force  and in the rest of the world  we sell and market primarily in japan  europe and latin america by channeling products through distributor organizations and sales agents 
we derive a significant portion of our net sales from three products 
for the years ended december   and  we derived approximately  and of our net sales from sales of our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy tests  respectively 
in the us  we lead the professional market in these three product categories with an estimated  and market share in influenza  pregnancy and group a strep products  respectively  as of december  additionally  we derive a significant portion of our net sales from a relatively small number of distributors 
approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from sales through our five largest distributors in each of those periods 
we also seek to develop research products through our newly organized and expanded spg with future rapid test applications as its primary emphasis 
the spg is currently responsible for more than of our clinical and research products used worldwide in reference laboratories  and in research applications at leading universities and biotechnology companies 
we believe the products managed by our spg have a market share in excess of in research markers and products 
our product sales declined to million in from million in this was largely related to a shortened flu season in our japanese market as compared to the prior period 
net sales of our influenza products in japan decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
as a result of the shortened flu season in japan  significant quantities of our influenza test remained in our japanese distributor s distribution channel  which had an adverse and material impact on sales of our influenza products in japan during first and fourth quarters of we ended with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  in march  we entered into a new million credit facility  and currently have million of availability 
we believe that the trend among healthcare providers to adopt poc testing is increasing  and demographic changes  reimbursement policies and the availability of clinically valuable tests will increase growth in this diagnostic category 
we believe that more and more employers  health plans and payors are recognizing that poc testing is a cost effective means for improving the quality of care and patient satisfaction 
continuous improvements in technologies are resulting in a growing number of new diagnostic tests that combine high levels of accuracy with rapid  easy to use product formats 
it is our mission to further establish our significant global leadership position in poc rapid diagnostics 
in order to accomplish this mission  our strategy is to strengthen market and brand leadership in infectious disease and reproductive health 
drive growth by establishing dedicated distributor partnerships 
drive profit through further refinement of industry leading manufacturing efficiencies 
identify and commercialize new markers  products and collaborations in oncology and bone health through our spg 
complete the full scale manufacturability feasibility study for our ltf immunoassay and continue parallel pathways for development and acquisition of other qualitative and quantitative technology platforms 
develop and maintain key relationships with third parties and cooperative collaborations 
aggressively pursue licensing  acquisition and partnership opportunities that meet our dedicated focus on research to rapids 
as part of our new strategy  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to exit and dispose of our urinalysis and ultrasonometer businesses 
the operations of both businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the statements of operations and certain related assets and liabilities of the urinalysis business were considered held for sale in the balance sheets 
as a business in a highly regulated and competitive industry  we face many risks and challenges and we also have opportunities 
there are many economic and industry factors that affect our business  some of the more important factors are discussed below sales of our products can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including convenience  price and product performance as well as the distribution  advertising  promotion and brand name recognition of the marketer 
our success will depend on our ability to remain abreast of technological advances  to introduce technologically advanced products  to effectively market our differentiated value products  to maintain our brand strength and to attract and retain experienced personnel  who are in great demand 
intellectual property protection of our products is crucial to our business 
loss of effective intellectual property protection on one or more products could result in lost sales to competing products and negatively affect our sales  royalty revenues and operating results 
we are currently involved in significant litigation concerning intellectual property 
the testing  manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory premarket approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the production processes for poc tests are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product 
shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs  and we currently do not anticipate any material difficulty in renewing any of our leases as they expire or securing additional or replacement facilities  in each case on commercially reasonable terms 
to successfully compete for business in our industry  we believe our poc testing solutions must be designed to provide specialized results that meet two important value criteria i clinical validation  which leads to the enabling of rapid patient management decisions resulting in improved treatment and outcomes  and ii economic validation  which reduces overall costs associated with patient testing with emphasis upon critical reimbursement and payor performance criteria 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last few years 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry  and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 
we expect this trend toward industry consolidation may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
sales of our group a strep and influenza products  which have accounted for approximately and in and  respectively  of net sales  are subject to  and significantly affected by  the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons 
as a result of these seasonal demands  we typically experience lower sales volume in our second and third quarters of the calendar year  and have higher sales in our first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
while we believe that the severity and length of the cold and flu season will continue to impact sales of our group a strep and influenza products  there can be no assurance that our future sales of these products will necessarily follow historical patterns 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues consolidated statements of operations data year ended december  revenues net sales research contracts  licenses and royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring total costs and expenses operating earnings other income expense other income interest and other expense total other income expense earnings from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes earnings from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net earnings loss net sales net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was largely driven by decreases in sales of our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy products of million  million and million  respectively 
these three product lines accounted for of our net sales during the decrease in sales of our influenza products was primarily due to a delay in shipments of our new influenza a b test in japan  partially offset by increased sales of our influenza products in the us the delay in japan was primarily due to a weak flu season  which ended abruptly in the early part of the first quarter of this resulted in significant quantities of our influenza a b test remaining in our japanese distributor s distribution channel  which also prevented us from shipping our new influenza a b product during the late third quarter and early fourth quarter of  as originally anticipated 
as a result  net sales to our japanese distributor decreased as a percentage of our total net sales to in from in we began shipping our new influenza a b product late in the fourth quarter of our influenza products currently have an estimated market share in japan and market share in the us  where we are the market leader 
the decrease in sales of our pregnancy products was primarily related to decreased revenues in our german market  partially offset by a slight increase within our us market 
in germany  as we transitioned to a distribution model during late and  our average selling price declined as expected  further impacted by a decline in unit volume  primarily due to the transition to our new distributor 
our us professional market share is an estimated for our pregnancy products  and we are the market leader 
we believe the decrease in our group a strep product sales was primarily due to a drop off in orders for group a strep test products as a result of us distributor confusion or concern created by ongoing intellectual property litigation initiated during the first part of we do not expect this trend to continue  and we have also implemented a price increase in our group a strep products  for which we maintain a market leadership position of an estimated in the us net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for our influenza and group a strep products  offset primarily by decreases in our pregnancy products 
the significantly greater demand for our influenza products during the third and fourth quarters of was largely driven by an early flu season 
our influenza and group a strep product sales increased approximately million and million  respectively  while our pregnancy tests decreased approximately million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  our sales estimates for future periods are closely based on estimated end user demand for our products 
sales to our distribution partners would fall short of expectations if distributor inventories increase because of less than estimated end user consumption or if distributor concerns over the intellectual property litigation increase 
for fiscal year  we currently expect significant growth in our revenues for influenza and group a strep products  while we anticipate some decline in our chlamydia  mononucleosis and veterinary products 
also  absent an extended flu season in japan  we currently do not expect significant sales of our influenza or group a strep products into japan until the third and fourth quarters of  but we are receiving continuing orders of these products from us distributors in the first quarter of research contracts  license fees and royalty income research contracts  license fees and royalty income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to million of research contract revenue that we earned in connection with achieving certain milestones under a joint development agreement with a fortune company 
additionally  we have million of upfront fees recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets for both periods ended december  and approximately million of this amount will be recognized as contract revenue ratably over the period of development  which is expected to be through  while the remainder will be recognized as contract revenue as certain milestones are completed 
the remaining balance of million within research contracts  license fees and royalty income for relates to royalty payments received on a patented technology of ours utilized by a third party 
the agreement covering the royalty payments extends through november  the expiration date of the patent 
research contracts  license fees and royalty income remained constant at approximately million for the years ended december  and  and primarily related to royalty income received on a patented technology of ours utilized by a third party 
cost of sales and gross profit from net sales gross profit from net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from net sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and a less favorable mix related to our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy products in  partially offset by cost savings in relating to our restructuring activities which occurred during during the fourth quarter of  a patent expired relating to one of the licensing agreements we have with a third party 
this licensing agreement required us to pay royalties ranging from to on our influenza  group a strep  pregnancy  h pylori  mononucleosis and veterinary products 
as a result  our royalty expense was favorably impacted by million for the year ended december  royalty expense related to this licensing agreement was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross profit from net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from net sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increases were primarily due to increased sales volume and favorable product mix  offset to a lesser extent by pricing pressures on our pregnancy products 
research and development expense research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales increased to of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to of net sales for the year ended december   largely due to lower net sales volume in the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to personnel related costs of million and laboratory supplies of million related to increased spending for the development of products on our ltf technology platform  customer sponsored research expenses of million related to our collaborative development efforts with a fortune company  and increased patent costs of million associated with patent development and protection 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for the years ended december  and the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to personnel related costs of million and clinical evaluations of million related to increased spending for the development of products on our ltf technology platform  as well as patent costs of million associated with patent development and protection 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for the years ended december  and the absolute dollar decrease relates primarily to cost savings of million in related to our restructuring activities undertaken during  including the closure of our sales and support offices in germany and italy  and to a lesser extent certain variable costs tied directly to our lower net sales  including freight out of million and commissions and customer promotions of million 
these cost savings were partially offset by increased costs of million associated with market research  promotion  public relations and advertising fees related to our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy products 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase of million relates primarily to certain variable costs tied directly to our increased net sales  including freight out of million  personnel costs and commissions of million and customer promotions of million 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase in was primarily due to legal fees associated with our intellectual property litigation of million  higher professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of of million  as well as costs incurred in connection with the hiring of a new chief executive officer and departure of our former chief executive officer of million  partially offset by higher professional fees during related to the re audit of our fiscal financial statements of million and bonuses paid of approximately million 
we believe we will continue to incur substantial legal fees related to the ongoing intellectual property litigation during general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to increased professional fees relating to the re audit of our financial statements of million and consulting and legal fees of million 
restructuring in april  we announced and implemented a restructuring plan the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan was primarily driven by manufacturing automation in our san diego facility  completion of certain research and development projects  implementation of our baan enterprise resource planning system in our santa clara facility  and the transition of our foreign sales and support offices to independent distributors 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of positions of our total workforce at such time and closure of our sales and support offices in heidelberg  germany and milan  italy 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million during the significant components of the restructuring charge were million for employee severance costs  million for contractual lease and commercial contract terminations  million for professional fees  and million for impairment charges related to assets that were deemed obsolete due to restructuring activities 
as of december   million of the restructuring charge had been paid and million was included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the entire million of the restructuring charge has been paid 
amortization of intangibles on january   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill in december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows  a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  and any significant change in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets are among many factors that could result in an impairment charge that could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our other intangible assets  which are being amortized over a period of three to years  include purchased technology  license agreements  patents  trademarks and a favorable lease 
amortization expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and and relates primarily to interest paid on obligations under capital leases  which are primarily related to our san diego facility 
income taxes we recorded no tax expense for the year ended december  due primarily to research tax credits which reduced our income tax expense 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  versus a tax provision of million for the year ended december  this change is due primarily to a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during the fourth quarter ended december  to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management  more likely than not  to be realized  and to a lesser extent  foreign operations for both periods 
based on the recent history of profitability and the forecasts for future periods  management determined it was more likely than not that net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences would be realized 
loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes as of december   our urinalysis and ultrasonometer businesses were reported as discontinued operations under sfas no 
accordingly  the operations of both businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the statements of operations for all periods presented 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million in  and included a million charge for impairment of assets and million related to losses from operations  net of taxes 
the charge for impairment of assets  net of taxes  included million for net assets held for sale related to the urinalysis business and million for asset impairment related to the discontinuance of the ultrasonometer business 
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and have been restated to reflect the results of operations of both businesses as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in was million  net of taxes  as compared to million  net of taxes  for and both amounts related to losses from operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
our working capital as of december was million 
our earnings from continuing operations provided cash of million during we had earnings from continuing operations of million  including million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
other changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to our decrease in net sales and earlier collections of outstanding receivables  an increase in inventory of million due to lower then expected net sales  decreases in accounts payable of million and accrued royalties of million  both as a result of decreased net sales and a decrease in other current liabilities of million  which included lower volume discounts of million as a result of lower net sales and million of bonuses earned during our earnings from continuing operations provided cash of million during we had earnings from continuing operations of million  including the release of a million valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  partially offset by non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
other changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable of million due to our increase in net sales  a decrease in inventory of million resulting from increased demand due to higher net sales  increases in accounts payable of million and accrued royalties of million as a result of our increase in net sales and an increase in other current liabilities of million  which included higher volume discounts of million as a result of lower net sales and million of bonuses earned during our investing activities used million and million of cash during and  respectively 
for  this included million for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment for our ltf products and other assets related to information technology  as well as million for certain intellectual property 
for  the entire million was used for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment for our ltf products and other assets related to information technology 
we are currently planning million in capital expenditures for the primary purpose for our capital expenditures is to acquire manufacturing equipment  implement building improvements  and for information technology 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we do not have any firm purchase commitments with respect to such planned expenditures as of the date of filing this annual report 
our financing activities provided million of cash during both and for both periods  the major source was proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans  offset slightly by million in both periods for payments on obligations under our capital leases related to our building in san diego 
in march  we entered into a new million credit facility the senior secured credit facility  which has a three and a half year term  maturing on june  in january  we terminated our existing million credit facility  which included a million term loan  which was to mature in july  and a million line of credit  which expired during january as of december  and through the date of termination in january  there were no borrowings outstanding under either the existing line of credit or term loan  and we were in compliance with all covenants 
the senior secured credit facility is secured by all of our assets and bears interest at a rate ranging from to plus the lender s prime rate or  at our option  a rate ranging from to plus the london interbank offering rate 
the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility also contains certain customary covenants restricting our ability to  among other matters  incur additional indebtedness  create liens or other encumbrances  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  make investments  loans and guarantees or sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets to  or merge or consolidate with  another entity 
the terms of the senior secured credit facility require us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a minimum net worth  a maximum ratio of debt drawn under the senior secured credit facility to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and minimum ebitda 
we currently have million of availability under the senior secured credit facility 
we also intend to continue evaluation of acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  we may need to incur additional debt  or sell additional equity  to successfully complete these acquisitions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we generate cash from operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on the current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet operating needs during the next months and the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations our facilities and certain equipment are leased under noncancelable capital and operating leases 
as of december   we had no contractual purchase commitments with any vendors  and the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     total      reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under capital leases  including current maturities  in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under operating leases in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
we have entered into various licensing agreements  which require royalty payments based on specified product sales 
these agreements encompass the majority of our products  which expire through royalty expenses under these licensing agreements  which are charged to cost of sales  totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe we will continue to incur substantial royalty expenses relating to future sales of our product 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we record revenues from product sales 
these revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts which are estimated at the time of sale  and are largely driven by various customer program offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revenue from product sales are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
title to the product and recognition of revenue occurs upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point 
we also earn income from the licensing of technology and from performing services under a joint development agreement 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recorded during the period the cash is received from the licensee 
milestone payments are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at a level comparable to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
income earned from licensing and distribution activities are classified under revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and adversely impact our reported results 
our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and adversely impact net operating results in the future 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the elimination of amortization relating to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles had a positive impact on net earnings for each of the years ended december  and of approximately million 
sfas no 
requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill in december and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  as of december   we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets through expected future taxable profits 
although realization is not assured  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the portion of deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was determined to be unnecessary will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence  primarily our projected earnings 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if actual future earnings or income tax rates are lower than estimated  or if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing taxable or deductible temporary differences 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to deferred tax assets created by the exercise and or disposition of employee stock options in recent periods 
the deferred tax asset originating from deductions for the exercise and or disposition of stock options and the related valuation allowance have been recorded against additional paid in capital and did not affect net earnings for the period 
any tax benefits realized from the reduction of this valuation allowance will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
we also have recorded a valuation allowance of million related to federal net operating losses of acquired businesses  which are available for our use 
the tax benefit of these tax loss carryforwards  if and when realized  will first reduce the existing value of goodwill up to a total of million  and any additional amount will be recognized as an income tax benefit 
we will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our other components of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination were made 
conversely  if based upon estimates of future earnings  we determine that all or a portion of the valuation allowance is no longer warranted  a reduction in the valuation would result in a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital  goodwill  and or income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements for information on recent accounting pronouncements which may impact our business  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations  which is accounted for as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations and have historically not been material 
nonetheless  changes from reporting period to reporting period in the exchange rates between various foreign currencies and the us dollar have had and will continue to have an impact on the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity reported by us  and such effect in the accounts of our foreign subsidiaries may become material in a reporting period 
the fair market value of our floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates
