item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with forward looking statements this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
these statements include  but are not limited to  statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses  planned asset dispositions  disposition pricing  planned acquisition and developments  property financings  and expected interest rates 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included in this report on form k will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 
the following are risks that the company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and common dividends  and or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing 
funds from operations and the value of the company s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the company s control 
such events or conditions could include competition from other apartment communities  overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in the company s markets  which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and or require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units  increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset by increased rents  the company s inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms  changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance  changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing  changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing  which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available or increase the company s acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available  weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing  decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by the company s joint ventures  and the relative illiquidity of real estate investments 
currently  the company relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate 
while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings  any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to reduce the distribution rate 
any decline in the company s funds from operations could adversely affect the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders or to met its loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on the company s stock price 
debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results at december   the company had total debt outstanding of billion 
payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit 
the company currently intends to limit its total debt to approximately of the undepreciated book value of its assets  although the company s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels 
circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time 
as of december   the company s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 
the company s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  the company must repay its debt upon maturity  and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company s financial condition and or its funds from operations 
variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations at december   effectively million of the company s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps 
an additional million also bore interest at a variable rate at december   but was hedged by an interest rate swap that becomes operative in may in addition  the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates 
variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase  which would adversely affect the company s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders 
the company s million secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital  credit enhanced by fannie mae  are predominately floating rate facilities 
the company also has a million credit facility with freddie mac which is a variable rate facility 
these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates the company was exposed to at december  large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps 
upon the termination of these swaps and caps  the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 
increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition because the company has substantial real estate holdings  the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its communities is a significant component of expense 
real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of the company 
if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise  the company s financial condition could be negatively impacted and the company s ability to pay its dividend could be affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  in that they require the most subjective judgments  form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  and fair value of derivative financial instruments 
capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years for land improvements and buildings  years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment  and to years for computers and software  all of which are judgmental determinations 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements  renovations  and replacements are capitalized 
the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company s standards are capitalized as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the company s fiscal fourth quarter  or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance  market conditions  and legal factors 
in accordance with statement  long lived assets  such as real estate assets  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
in the apartment industry  the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate 
the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property s market or submarket 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of derivative financial instruments the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps and caps  during the normal course of business to manage  or hedge  the interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 
the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under statement no 
as amended requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective 
while the company s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations  the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 
the company performs ineffectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter  through the term of the hedging instruments 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity

this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit definition 
disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock  the company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its ffo calculation 
the company s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting  vinyl flooring  and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties 
during the stabilization period for acquisition properties  these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties  and  thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding the company s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets 
the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets  whose value does not diminish predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits

trends property performance over the past two years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the company s markets 
the economic downturn and the related low interest rate environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for apartment units  while allowing delivery levels of newly constructed apartment units to remain consistent with and in some cases above historical averages 
the recent economic environment has impacted demand in two main ways producing lower job growth  which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the company s markets  and producing lower interest rates which has increased the affordability of single family housing  prompting more renters to purchase homes 
on the supply side  the declining interest rates have provided an incentive to developers to construct new apartment units in many of the company s markets  especially in the larger metropolitan markets 
delivery of these new units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased competition  adding pressure to apartment occupancy levels and pricing in a number of the company s markets 
as part of its strategy to create continued stable and growing performance  the company maintains a portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets  mid sized markets  and smaller tier markets  as defined by population levels 
during the economic downturn  the company s smaller tier and mid sized markets produced more stable performance  while its larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances 
the company is beginning to see indications of stronger job growth in many of its markets  which could indicate an improvement in the general economic environment 
as and if the economic environment improves  the company expects to see more household formations and increasing interest rates  which the company believes will combine to increase the number of apartment renters and decrease the construction of new apartment units 
while increasing interest rates will increase the company s cost of borrowing  the company expects that this increase in demand will also generate stronger property performance across the company s portfolio 
the company s large tier markets  which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn  should begin to absorb the oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and pricing levels  while the company s smaller tier and mid sized markets will also benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth 
over the long term  general demographic trends are expected to favor apartment owners  as immigration growth  combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from the echo boomers children of the baby boomers is expected to produce more apartment renters over the next ten years 
the company believes its portfolio location throughout the southeast and south central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of these improving demographic trends 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately  to  for compared to  for mainly related to the growth of the company through the bremaac buyout and the acquisitions and acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities remained relatively stable  increasing from approximately  in to  in a total of approximately  was invested in to acquire properties including the bremaac buyout  this compares to approximately  in these amounts were only slightly offset by proceeds from dispositions of assets of approximately  in and  in capital improvements to existing real estate assets during and totaled approximately  and  respectively

the company refinanced an additional million of bonds using its tax free bond facility  credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association fnma the tax free bond facility 
the company also refinanced a total of million representing the debt on six of the properties it acquired through its partnership buyout of bre maac associates  llc in using a renegotiated secured credit facility with prudential mortgage capital  credit enhanced by fnma the fnma facility 
during the three month period ended june   the company refinanced an million mortgage using its existing fnma facility 
the company amended the amsouth facility to extend the maturity by one year and increased the loan to value from to  effectively increasing the borrowing base from million to million 
the company also paid off the mortgages of five properties 
the five properties were then used to collateralize a loan under a new credit agreement with financial federal savings bank  which was subsequently purchased and credit enhanced by freddie mac the freddie mac facility 
the freddie mac facility has a commitment amount of million and a maturity date of july  during the three month period ended september   the company refinanced the debt on the remaining four properties it acquired through its partnership buyout of bre maac associates  llc in using the fnma facility

the company also used the fnma facility to pay off loans maturing on three properties with prudential totaling million 
at december   the tax free bond facility and the fnma facility together the fnma facilities had a combined credit line limit of million  million of which was available to borrow 
the fnma facilities have multiple maturity traunches that range from through the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security dmbs rate on the date of renewal  which has typically approximated three month libor less an average spread of over the life of the fnma facilities  plus a credit enhancement fee of 
each of the company s credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage 
if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing  the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
moreover  if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility  after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default  accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and or foreclose on properties securing such facilities 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its current and future interest rate risk 
as of december   the company had interest rate swaps in effect with a total notional amount of million 
these swaps have to date proven to be highly effective hedges 
the company has also entered into a future interest rate swap which will go into effect in the second quarter of the company had three interest rate cap agreements in effect as of december   representing a total notional amount of million

the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations  annual refurbishment of its properties  and incremental investment in new apartment properties 
the company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities  and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma  which provides credit enhancement for approximately million of the company s debt 
the interest rate market for fnma dmbs  which in the company s experience is highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates  is also an important component of the company s liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness 
in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient  or the credit of fnma becomes impaired  the company would seek alternative sources of debt financing 
for the year ended december   the company s net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million short of funding improvements to existing real estate assets  distributions to unitholders  and dividends paid on common and preferred shares 
this compared to a shortfall of approximately million for the same period in while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings  if necessary  any significant deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to reduce the distribution rate
