see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our operating segments and geographic information 
technology we specialize in analytics  software and data management technologies that analyze data and drive business processes and decision strategies 
we maintain active research in a number of fields for the purposes of deriving greater insight and predictive value from data  making various forms of data more usable and valuable to the model building process  and automating and applying analytics to the various processes involved in making high volume decisions in real time 
because of our pioneering work in credit scoring and fraud detection  we are widely recognized as the leader in predictive analytics

in all our work  we believe that our tools and processes are among the very best commercially available  and that we are uniquely able to integrate advanced analytic  software and data technologies into mission critical business solutions that offer superior returns on investment 
principal areas of expertise predictive modeling 
predictive modeling identifies and mathematically represents underlying relationships in historical data in order to explain the data and make predictions or classifications about future events 
our models summarize large quantities of data to amplify its value 
predictive models typically analyze current and historical data on individuals to produce easily understood metrics such as scores 
these scores rank order individuals by likely future performance  eg  their likelihood of making credit payments on time  or of responding to a particular offer for services 
we also include in this category models that detect the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent 
our predictive models are frequently operationalized in mission critical transactional systems and drive decisions and actions in near real time 
a number of analytic methodologies underlie our products in this area 
these include proprietary applications of both linear and non linear mathematical programming algorithms  in which one objective is optimized within a set of constraints  and advanced neural systems  which learn complex patterns from large data sets to predict the probability that a new individual will exhibit certain behaviors of business interest 
we also apply various related statistical techniques for analysis and pattern detection within large datasets 
for example  we recently 
table of contents developed a proprietary technology we call pair wise co occurrence consistency or peacock  which we use to analyze large scale purchase transaction data to reveal product relationships  purchase patterns and sequences 
decision analysis and optimization 
decision analysis refers to the broad quantitative field that deals with modeling  analyzing and optimizing decisions made by individuals  groups and organizations 
whereas predictive models analyze multiple aspects of individual behavior to forecast future behavior  decision analysis analyzes multiple aspects of a given decision to identify the most effective action to take to reach a desired result 
we have developed an integrated approach to decision analysis that incorporates the development of a decision model that mathematically maps the entire decision structure  proprietary optimization technology that identifies the most effective strategies  given both the performance objective and constraints  the development of designed testing required for active  continuous learning  and the robust extrapolation of an optimized strategy to a wider set of scenarios than historically encountered 
this technology is behind our strategy science solutions 
transaction profiling 
transaction profiling is a patent protected technique used to extract meaningful information and reduce the complexity of transaction data used in modeling 
many of our products operate using transactional data  such as credit card purchase transactions  or other types of data that change over time 
in its raw form  this data is very difficult to use in predictive models for several reasons first  an isolated transaction contains very little information about the behavior of the individual that generated the transaction 
in addition  transaction patterns change rapidly over time 
finally  this type of data can often be highly complex 
to overcome these issues  we have developed a set of proprietary techniques that transform raw transactional data into a mathematical representation that reveals latent information  and which make the data more usable by predictive models 
this profiling technology accumulates data across multiple transactions of many types to create and update profiles of transaction patterns 
these profiles enable our neural network models to efficiently and effectively make accurate assessments of  for example  fraud risk and credit risk within real time transaction streams 
customer data integration 
decisions made on customers or prospects can benefit from data stored in multiple sources  both inside and outside the enterprise 
we have focused on developing data integration processes that are able to assemble and integrate those disparate data sources into a unified view of the customer or household  through the application of persistent keying technology 
decision management software 
in order to make a decision strategy operational  the various steps and rules need to be programmed or exported into the business software infrastructure  where it can communicate with front end  customer facing systems and back end systems such as billing systems 
we have developed software systems  sometimes known as decision engines and business rules management systems  that perform the necessary functions to execute a decision strategy 
our software includes very efficient programs for these functions  facilitating  for example  business user definition of extremely complex decision strategies using graphic user interfaces  simultaneous testing of hundreds of decision strategies in champion challenger test control mode  high volume processing and analysis of transactions in real time  integration of multiple data sources  and execution of predictive models for improved behavior forecasts and finer segmentation 
research and development activities our research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continually maintain and improve our core technologies  enhance our existing products  and develop new products and technologies that meet an expanding range of markets and customer requirements 
in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  we use our own development tools extensively 
we have traditionally relied primarily on the internal development of our products 
based on timing and cost considerations  however  we have acquired  and in the future may consider acquiring  technology or products from third parties 

table of contents product protection and trademarks we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
we retain the title to and protect the suite of models and software used to develop scoring models as a trade secret 
we also restrict access to our source code and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we have generally relied upon the laws protecting trade secrets and upon contractual non disclosure safeguards and restrictions on transferability to protect our software and proprietary interests in our product and service methodology and know how 
our confidentiality procedures include invention assignment and proprietary information agreements with our employees and independent contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with our distributors  strategic partners and customers 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we have patents on many of our technologies and have patent applications pending on other technologies 
the patents we hold may not be upheld as valid and may not prevent the development of competitive products 
in addition  patents may never be issued on our pending patent applications or on any future applications that we may submit 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy or reproduce aspects of our software or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
patents and other protections for our intellectual property are important  but we believe our success and growth will depend principally on such factors as the knowledge  ability  experience and creative skills of our personnel  new products  frequent product enhancements  and name recognition 
we have developed technologies for research projects conducted under agreements with various united states government agencies or their subcontractors 
although we have acquired commercial rights to these technologies  the united states government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies that we develop under these contracts 
in some cases  the united states government can terminate our rights to these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis 
in addition  under united states government contracts  the government may make the results of our research public  which could limit our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on funded research 
we have used  registered and or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks for our technologies  products and services

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview we are a leader in enterprise decision management edm solutions that enable businesses to automate and improve their decisions 
our predictive modeling  decision analysis  intelligence management  decision management systems and consulting services power billions of customer decisions each year 
we help companies acquire customers more efficiently  increase customer value  reduce fraud and credit losses  lower operating expenses and enter new markets more profitably 
most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions  as do many insurers  retailers  telecommunications providers  healthcare organizations and government agencies 
we also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their fico scores  the standard measure of credit risk  to manage their financial health 
most of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  and during the year ended september   of our revenues were derived from within these industries 
a significant portion of our remaining revenues is derived from the telecommunications  healthcare and retail industries  as well as the government sector 
our clients utilize our products and services to facilitate a variety of business processes  including customer marketing and acquisition  account origination  credit and underwriting risk management  fraud loss prevention and control  and client account and policyholder management 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from transactional or unit based software license fees  annual license fees under long term software license arrangements  transactional fees derived under scoring  network service or internal hosted software arrangements  and annual software maintenance fees 
the recurrence of these revenues is  to a significant degree  dependent upon our clients continued usage of our products and services in their business activities 
the more significant activities underlying the use of our products in these areas include credit and debit card usage or active account levels  lending acquisition  origination and customer management activity  workers compensation and automobile medical injury insurance claims  and wireless and wireline calls and subscriber levels 
approximately of our revenues during fiscal were derived from arrangements with transactional or unit based pricing 
we also derive revenues from other sources which generally do not recur and include  but are not limited to  perpetual or time based licenses with upfront payment terms  non recurring professional service arrangements and gain share arrangements where revenue is derived based on percentages of client revenue growth or cost reductions attributable to our products 
within a number of our sectors there has been a sizable amount of industry consolidation 
in addition  many of our sectors are experiencing increased levels of competition 
as a result of these factors  we believe that future revenues in particular sectors may decline 
however  due to the long term customer arrangements we have with many of our customers  the near term impact of these declines may be more limited in certain sectors 
one measure used by management as an indicator of our business performance is the volume of new bookings achieved 
we define a new booking as estimated future contractual revenues  including agreements with perpetual  multi year and annual terms 
new bookings values may include i estimates of variable fee components such as hours to be incurred under new professional services arrangements and customer account or transaction activity for agreements with transactional based fee arrangements  ii additional or expanded business from renewals of contracts  and iii to a lesser extent  previous customers that have attrited and been re sold only as a result of a significant sales effort 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we achieved new bookings of million  including four deals with bookings values of million or more 
in comparison  new bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  including eight deals with bookings values of million or more 
management regards the volume of new bookings achieved  among other factors  as an important indicator of future revenues  but they are not comparable to  nor should they be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues  and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors  below  concerning timing and contingencies affecting product delivery and performance 
although many of our contracts have fixed non cancelable terms  some of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice 
accordingly  we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize all of our new bookings as backlog that will generate future revenue 
our revenues derived from clients outside the united states continue to grow  and may in the future grow more rapidly than our revenues from domestic clients 
international revenues totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total consolidated revenues in each of these years 
in addition to clients acquired via our acquisitions  we believe that our international growth is a product of successful relationships with third parties that assist in international sales efforts and our own increased sales focus internationally  and we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from international clients will increase in the future 
we acquired spectrum in december  narex in july  diversified healthcare services in september  seurat in october  london bridge in may  braun in november and rulespower in september results of operations from these acquisitions are included prospectively from the date of acquisition 
as a result of these acquisitions  our financial results during the year ended september   are not directly comparable to those during the years ended september  and  or other years prior to any of these acquisitions 
our reportable segments are strategy machine solutions  scoring solutions  professional services and analytic software tools 
although we sell solutions and services into a large number of end user product and industry markets  our reportable business segments reflect the primary method in which management organizes and evaluates internal financial information to make operating decisions and assess performance

loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes in july  our board of directors approved the cash redemption of all of the outstanding subordinated notes at a redemption price equal to of the million principal amount of the subordinated notes  pursuant to the redemption criteria in the indenture 
in september  we redeemed all of the outstanding subordinated notes with a cash outlay of million  which resulted in the recognition of a loss on redemption of million  representing the excess of the redemption cost over the carrying amount of the notes upon redemption 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of realized investment gains losses  exchange rate gains losses resulting from re measurement of foreign denominated receivable and cash balances held by our us reporting entities into the us dollar functional currency at period end market rates  net of the impact of offsetting forward exchange contracts  and other non operating items 
the fiscal over decrease in other income was due to a decline in realized gains on sales of our marketable securities of million  including a million gain recognized last year on the sale of our investment in open solutions  inc osi 
the decline in other income was partially offset by foreign exchange gains of million recognized in fiscal  compared with a net foreign currency loss of million recorded in fiscal the foreign exchange loss in fiscal resulted from a million net foreign exchange loss recorded in connection with our london bridge acquisition 
this net foreign exchange loss represented the excess of a loss recorded on a forward foreign exchange contract entered into in connection with this transaction over exchange rate gains resulting from the re measurement of british pound sterling cash balances held by one of our us dollar functional currency entities for the purpose of funding the acquisition 
the fiscal over increase in other income was attributable to an increase in realized gains on sales of our marketable securities of million  including the million gain recognized on the sale of our osi investment 
these gains were partially offset primarily by an increase in foreign exchange losses of million during fiscal  principally due to the million net foreign exchange loss recorded in connection with our london bridge acquisition 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was impacted by the recognition of million of tax benefits related to prior years 
these benefits were determined in conjunction with tax studies we performed with outside advisors that identified additional federal and state tax credits and other deductions related to prior years tax returns 
the tax benefits recognized reflect our estimate of the effect of amended tax returns filed for fiscal through these tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by 
excluding these tax benefits  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been 
the decline in the effective tax rate was also the result of the current year benefit of the additional deductions identified by the aforementioned tax studies 
the fiscal over increase in our effective tax rate was principally due to decreased us federal research and development tax credits resulting from the inability to recognize such credit during our fourth quarter of fiscal despite the retroactive reenactment of such credit in the first quarter of fiscal  and to our inability to recognize a tax benefit on the foreign losses associated with our london bridge subsidiary 

table of contents operating income the following table sets forth certain summary information on a segment basis related to our operating income for the fiscal years indicated 
period to period period to period percentage change change fiscal year to to to to segment in thousands strategy machine solutions scoring solutions professional services analytic software tools segment operating income unallocated restructuring and acquisition related expense operating income the fiscal over fiscal increase in operating income was attributable primarily to an increase in segment revenues  which included a million increase in revenues that resulted from our acquisitions in fiscal and the increase was partially offset by an increase of million in the amortization of intangible assets that resulted from our acquisitions in fiscal and at the segment level  the increase in segment operating income was driven by increases of million  million and million in segment operating income within our scoring solutions  professional services and analytic software tools segments  respectively  partially offset by a million decrease in segment operating income within our strategy machine solutions segment 
the increase in scoring solutions segment operating income was attributable primarily to an increase in revenues derived from risk scoring services at the credit reporting agencies  resulting from increased sales of scores for prescreening activities  and an increase in revenues derived from our own prescreening services 
the increase in professional services segment operating income was the result of an increase in precision marketing service revenues and implementations of edm products 
in our analytic software tools segment  higher segment operating income was due to an increase in sales of perpetual licenses for our edm products 
the decrease in strategy machine solutions segment operating income was attributable to revenue declines we experienced in insurance and healthcare solutions and marketing solutions  the impact of negative operating margins associated with london bridge product offerings  partially offset by increases in sales of higher margin product offerings 
the fiscal over fiscal increase in operating income was attributable primarily to an increase in segment revenues  which included a million increase in revenues that resulted from our acquisitions in fiscal and  and to a lesser degree  a million decrease in restructuring and acquisition related expenses 
at the segment level  the increase in operating income was attributable primarily to million  million and million increases in segment operating income within our analytic software tools  scoring solutions and professional services segments  respectively  partially offset by a million decrease in segment operating income within our strategy machine solutions segment 
the increase in analytic software tools segment operating income was driven primarily by an increase in sales of higher margin perpetual licenses related to our analytic decision tools and model development software products 
the increase in scoring solutions segment operating income was primarily due to an increase in revenues derived from risk scoring services at the credit reporting agencies  resulting from increased sales of scores for prescreening and account review  partially offset by a decrease in various other scoring services 
the increase in professional services segment operating income was primarily due to an increase in higher margin model development and business consulting revenues 
the decrease in strategy machine solutions segment operating income was attributable primarily to the fiscal impact of negative operating margins associated with london bridge strategy machine solutions product offerings and to the allocation of the majority of a 
table of contents legal settlement charge to this segment  partially offset by the growth of segment revenues and operating margins associated with other higher margin product offerings 
the negative operating margins associated with london bridge strategy machine solutions were attributable in part to the write down of deferred maintenance revenue to fair market value  resulting from purchase accounting adjustments 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows from operating activities our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal operating cash flows was driven by the million increase in net income and a million prepayment net of revenue recognized from a single customer for future services  which is reflected in deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet 
operating cash flows were negatively impacted by an increase in trade receivables of million  which was the result of higher sales volumes and slower collections 
in addition  operating cash flows were negatively affected by payments of million for acquisition related restructuring activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the effect of net working capital changes partially offset by a decrease of million in net income 
operating cash flows improved as a result of increased collections of accounts receivable balances and an increase in customer prepayments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal the change in cash flows from investing activities was attributable to a million decline in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases  a million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions  due to our acquisition of london bridge in may  and million in cash proceeds related to our disposition of london bridge phoenix software  inc  a subsidiary of london bridge  in november net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal the change in cash flows from investing activities was partially attributable to million of cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases  in fiscal as compared with cash used of from the purchase of marketable securities  net of sales and maturities  in fiscal in addition  cash flows from investing activities were impacted by a million increase in net cash paid for acquisitions  principally as a result of our acquisition of london bridge in may  and a million increase in property and equipment purchases 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used for financing activities was due to a million increase in common stock repurchased 
the increase was partially offset by million of cash used in fiscal in connection with the september redemption of our subordinated notes and an million increase in cash proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock option and purchase plans 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the shift to net cash used in financing activities during fiscal  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal  was attributable to a decrease of million in net proceeds from the fiscal issuance of the senior notes  cash used of million in connection with the september redemption of our subordinated notes  and a million decrease in proceeds from issuances of common stock  partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for repurchases of our common stock 

table of contents repurchases of common stock from time to time  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
during fiscal  and  we expended million  million and million  respectively  in connection with our repurchase of common stock under such programs 
in august  our board of directors approved a new common stock repurchase program that allows us to purchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of million 
through september   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of million 
dividends we paid quarterly dividends of two cents per share  or eight cents per year  during each of fiscal  and our dividend rate is set by the board of directors on a quarterly basis taking into account a variety of factors  including among others  our operating results and cash flows  general economic and industry conditions  our obligations  changes in applicable tax laws and other factors deemed relevant by the board 
although we expect to continue to pay dividends at the current rate  our dividend rate is subject to change from time to time based on the board s business judgment with respect to these and other relevant factors 
senior convertible notes in august  we issued million of senior notes that mature on august  the senior notes become convertible into shares of fair isaac common stock  subject to the conditions described below  at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments for certain events 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares of fair isaac common stock per  principal amount of the senior notes 
holders may surrender their senior notes for conversion  if any of the following conditions is satisfied i prior to august   during any fiscal quarter  if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is more than of the conversion price per share of our common stock on the corresponding trading day  ii at any time after the closing sale price of our common stock on any date after august  is more than of the then current conversion price  iii during the five consecutive business day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price of a senior note was less than of the average sale price of our common stock during such trading day period multiplied by the applicable conversion rate  provided  however  if  on the day before the conversion date  the closing price of our common stock is greater than of the conversion price but less than or equal to of the conversion price  then holders converting their notes may receive  in lieu of our common stock based on the applicable conversion rate  at our option  cash or common stock with a value equal to of the principal amount of the notes on the conversion date  iv if we have called the senior notes for redemption  or v if we make certain distributions to holders of our common stock or we enter into specified corporate transactions 
the conversion price of the senior notes will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain dilutive events as described in the indenture  which include but are not limited to i dividends  distributions  subdivisions  or combinations of our common stock  ii issuance of rights or warrants for the purchase of our common stock under certain circumstances  iii the distribution to all or substantially all holders of our common stock of shares of our capital stock  evidences of indebtedness  or other non cash assets  or rights or warrants  iv the cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of our common stock in excess of certain levels  and v certain tender offer activities by us or any of our subsidiaries 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of fair isaac and rank equal in right of payment with all of our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the senior notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the senior notes bear regular interest at an annual rate of  payable on august and february of each year until august  beginning august   regular interest will accrue at the rate of  and be due and payable upon the earlier to occur of redemption  repurchase  or final maturity 
in addition  the senior notes bear contingent interest during any six month period from august to february 
table of contents and from february to august  commencing with the six month period beginning august   if the average trading price of the senior notes for the five trading day period immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the principal amount of  plus accrued and unpaid regular interest on  the senior notes 
the amount of contingent interest payable on the senior notes in respect of any six month period will equal per annum of the average trading price of the senior notes for the five trading day period immediately preceding such six month period 
we may redeem for cash all or part of the senior notes on and after august   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the million of senior notes on august   august   august  and august   or upon a change in control  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on march   we completed an exchange offer for the senior notes  whereby holders of approximately of the total principal amount of our senior notes exchanged their existing securities for new senior convertible notes  series b new notes 
the terms of the new notes are similar to the terms of the senior notes described above  except that i upon conversion  we will pay holders cash in an amount equal to the lesser of the principal amount of such notes and the conversion value of such notes  and to the extent such conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the notes  the remainder of the conversion obligation in cash or common shares or combination thereof  ii in the event of a change of control  we may be required in certain circumstances to pay a make whole premium on the new notes converted in connection with the change of control and iii if the conversion condition in the first clause iii in the third paragraph preceding this paragraph is triggered and the closing price of our common stock is greater than of the conversion price but less than or equal to of the conversion price  the holders converting new notes shall receive cash with a value equal to of the principal amount of new notes on the conversion date 
we incurred approximately million of professional fees associated with the exchange offer  which were expensed as incurred in fiscal credit agreement we are party to a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a million revolving line of credit through february under the agreement  as amended  we are required to comply with various financial covenants  which include but are not limited to  minimum levels of domestic liquidity  parameters for treasury stock repurchases  and merger and acquisition requirements 
at our option  borrowings under this agreement bear interest at the rate of libor plus which was at september  or at the financial institution s prime rate which was at september   payable monthly 
the agreement also includes a letter of credit subfeature that allows us to issue commercial and standby letters of credit up to a maximum amount of million and a foreign exchange facility that allows us to enter into contracts with the financial institution to purchase and sell certain currencies  subject to a maximum aggregate amount of million and other specified limits 
as of september   no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement and we were in compliance with all related covenants 
as of september   this credit facility served to collateralize certain letters of credit aggregating million  issued by us in the normal course of business 
available borrowings under this credit agreement are reduced by the principal amount of letters of credit and by of the aggregate amount of contracts to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies outstanding under the facility 
capital resources and liquidity outlook as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable security investments 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise 
table of contents additional funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at september  fiscal year thereafter total in thousands senior notes operating lease obligations total commitments million represents the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
our senior notes are classified in long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet at september  holders may require us to purchase the senior notes upon delivery of a written purchase notice on specific dates  the earliest of which is august refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding the senior notes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions  internal use software  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at our customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements 
table of contents occurs or when fair value can be established 
the determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions 
we evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue 
we have not experienced significant variances between our assumptions and actual results in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable assumptions in the future 
when software licenses are sold together with implementation or consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized using contract accounting as described below 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if an arrangement provides for customer acceptance  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 
revenues recognized from our credit scoring  data processing  data management and internet delivery services are recognized as these services are performed  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the determination of certain of our credit scoring and data processing revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information  if available  or based on average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate transaction volumes in the future  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data was received  and this could have a material impact on our results of operations during the period of time that we changed accounting methods 
transactional or unit based license fees under software license arrangements  network service and internally hosted software agreements are recognized as revenue based on system usage or when fees based on system usage exceed monthly minimum license fees  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
the determination of certain of our transactional or unit based license fee revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction usage or active account volumes in instances where this information is reported to us by our clients on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information  if available  or based on average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate customer account or transaction volumes in the future  revenue would be deferred until actual customer data was received  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we provide consulting  training  model development and software integration services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
for fixed price service contracts  we apply the percentage of completion method 
table of contents of contract accounting to determine progress towards completion  which requires the use of estimates 
in such instances  management is required to estimate the input measures  generally based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours of the project  with consideration also given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and  accordingly  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services exists  we apply the completed contract method of accounting and defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed 
revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method in excess of contract billings is recorded as an unbilled receivable 
such amounts are generally billable upon reaching certain performance milestones as defined by individual contracts 
billings collected in advance of performance and recognition of revenue under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue 
in certain of our non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements eg  american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
if not  we apply the separation provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and fair value of the undelivered element s exists 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
sometimes this results in recognizing the entire arrangement fee when delivery of the last element in a multiple element arrangement occurs 
for example  if the last undelivered element is a service  we recognize revenue for the entire arrangement fee as the service is performed  or if no pattern of performance is discernable  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment cycles 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we 
table of contents did not reasonably estimate the amount of our doubtful accounts in the future  it could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  and in certain cases non recurring charges associated with the write off of in process research and development ipr d  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  in connection with our business combinations accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method or based on forecasted cash flows associated with the assets over the estimated useful lives  while ipr d is recorded as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is periodically assessed for impairment 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales and services  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents or trademarks  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur and assumptions may change 
estimates using different assumptions could also produce significantly different results 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of our intangible assets 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to our previously recorded intangible assets  then we test for impairment using undiscounted cash flows 
if such tests indicate impairment  then we measure the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset  which is measured using discounted cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and other long lived assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified 
we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly traded companies 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  and other relevant factors  as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal  indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date 
accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
there are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
therefore  the timing and 
table of contents recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 
internal use software costs incurred to develop internal use software during the application development stage are capitalized and reported at cost  subject to an impairment test as described below 
application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal use software configuration  coding  installation and testing 
costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred 
we assess potential impairment of capitalized internal use software whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
this analysis requires us to estimate future net cash flows associated with the assets  as well as the future costs of selling such assets 
if these estimates change  reductions or write offs of internal use software costs could result 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  which requires the use of estimates 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period or reduce goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period or increase goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that our the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable  and such an increase could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities also involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could also have a material impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to products and services  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
if the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
if the potential loss is considered less than probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure of the matter is considered 
the amount of loss accrual or disclosure  if any  is determined after analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
due to uncertainties related to these matters  accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time 
significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses 
revisions

among other things  sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as providing the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we are required to adopt the new accounting provisions of sfas r for our first quarter of fiscal we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over our awards vesting period 
sfas r requires us to record compensation expense for all awards granted after adopting the standard  as well as recording compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated net income and net income per share 
however  various uncertainties  including stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  employee stock option exercise behavior and related tax impacts  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense to be incurred in future periods will be similar to the pro forma expense disclosed in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
risk factors risks related to our business we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services  and if the market does not continue to accept these products and services  our revenue will decline 
we expect that revenues derived from our scoring solutions  account management solutions  fraud solutions  originations  collections  and insurance solutions products and services will account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our revenues will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products and services 
factors that might affect the market acceptance of these products and services include the following changes in the business analytics industry  technological change  our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance products  saturation of market demand  loss of key customers  industry consolidation  and inability to successfully sell our products in new vertical markets 

table of contents if we do not engage in acquisition activity to the extent we have in the past  we may be unable to increase our revenues at historical growth rates 
our historical revenue growth has been augmented by numerous acquisitions  and we anticipate that acquisitions will continue to be an important part of our revenue growth 
our future revenue growth rate may decline if we do not make acquisitions of similar size and at a comparable rate as in the past 
if we engage in acquisitions or significant investment in new businesses  we will incur a variety of risks  any of which may adversely affect our business 
we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses  which include failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined business  overpayment for the acquired companies or assets  difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  product liability exposure associated with acquired businesses or the sale of their products  disruption of our ongoing business  dilution of our existing stockholders and earnings per share  unanticipated liabilities  legal risks and costs  retention of key personnel  distraction of management from our ongoing business  and impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new management personnel 
these risks could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations  particularly if they occur in the context of a significant acquisition 
acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the us will increase our exposure to the risks of conducting operations in international markets 
we rely on relatively few customers  as well as our contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies  for a significant portion of our revenues 
if the terms of these relationships change  our revenues and operating results could decline 
most of our customers are relatively large enterprises  such as banks  insurance companies  healthcare firms  retailers and telecommunications carriers 
as a result  many of our customers and potential customers are significantly larger than we are and may have sufficient bargaining power to demand reduced prices and favorable nonstandard terms 
we also derive a substantial portion of our revenues and operating income from our contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies  transunion  equifax and experian  and other parties that distribute our products to certain markets 
the loss of any major customer  the loss of a relationship with one of the major credit reporting agencies  the loss of a significant third party distributor or the delay of significant revenue from these sources  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
if we experience defects  failures and delays associated with the introduction of new products  our business could suffer serious harm 
significant undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of products may affect market acceptance of our products and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the past  we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new products and product enhancements  primarily due to difficulties developing models  acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environ 
table of contents ments 
we have also experienced errors or bugs in our software products  despite testing prior to release of the products 
software errors in our products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
errors or defects in our products that are significant  or are perceived to be significant  could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources  product liability claims and increased service and support costs and warranty claims 
we rely on relationships with third parties for marketing and distribution 
if we experience difficulties in these relationships  our future revenues may be adversely affected 
our scoring solutions segment and strategy machine solutions segment rely on distributors  and we intend to continue to market and distribute our products through existing and future distributor relationships 
our scoring solutions segment relies on  among others  transunion  equifax and experian 
failure by our existing and future distributors to generate significant revenues  demands by such distributors to change the terms on which they offer our products  or our failure to establish additional distribution or sales and marketing alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  distributors may compete with us either by developing competitive products themselves or by distributing competitive offerings 
for example  credit reporting agencies may evaluate and seek to distribute or acquire alternative vendors prepaid products that compete with our products 
competition from distributors or other sales and marketing partners could significantly harm sales of our products 
the occurrence of certain negative events may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations due to a number of factors  including variations in our revenues and operating results 
we believe that you should not rely on period to period comparisons of financial results as an indication of future performance 
because many of our operating expenses will not be affected by short term fluctuations in revenue  short term fluctuations in revenues may significantly impact operating results 
additional factors that will cause our stock price to fluctuate include the following variability in demand from our existing customers  failure to meet the expectations of market analysts  changes in recommendations by market analysts  the lengthy and variable sales cycle of many products  combined with the relatively large size of orders for our products  increase the likelihood of short term fluctuation in revenues  consumer dissatisfaction with  or problems caused by  the performance of our products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions in comparison with our competitors  the level of our operating expenses  changes in competitive conditions in the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions  our ability to complete large installations on schedule and within budget  acquisition related expenses and charges  and timing of orders for and deliveries of software systems 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the stock prices of many technology companies  and these fluctuations sometimes have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as industry specific and general economic conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our products have long and variable sales cycles 
if we do not accurately predict these cycles  we may not forecast our financial results accurately and our stock price could be adversely affected 
we experience difficulty in forecasting our revenues accurately because the length of our sales cycles makes it difficult for us to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
as a result of our sales cycle  license revenue and operating results may vary significantly from period to period 
the sales cycle of license our products typically ranges from days to months 
customers are often cautious in making decisions to acquire our products  because purchasing our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital  and may involve shifts by the customer to a new software and or hardware platform or changes in the customer s operational procedures 
delays in completing sales can arise while customers complete their internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures and test and accept our applications 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur and experience fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
if we are unable to accurately forecast our revenues  our stock price could be adversely affected 
we typically have revenue transactions concentrated in the final weeks of a quarter which may prevent accurate forecasting of our financial results and cause our stock price to decline 
large portions of our software license agreements are consummated in the weeks immediately preceding quarter end 
before a quarter end agreements are consummated  however  we create and rely on forecasted revenues for planning  modeling and earnings guidance 
forecasts  however  are only estimates and actual results may vary for a particular quarter or longer periods of time 
consequently  significant discrepancies between actual and forecasted results could limit our ability to plan  budget or provide accurate guidance  which could adversely affect our stock price 
any publicly stated revenue or earnings projections are subject to this risk 
the failure to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel could hinder our ability to successfully manage our business 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain experienced sales  consulting  research and development  marketing  technical support and management personnel 
the complexity of our products requires highly trained customer service and technical support personnel to assist customers with product installation and deployment 
the labor market for these individuals is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding and may become more competitive with general market and economic improvement 
we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially technical  sales and consulting personnel  and we may need additional staff to support new customers and or increased customer needs 
we may also recruit skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states 
limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could hinder our ability to attract necessary qualified personnel and harm our business and future operating results 
there is a risk that even if we invest significant resources in attempting to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  we will not succeed in our efforts  and our business could be harmed 
non appreciation in the value of our stock may adversely affect our ability to use equity and equity based incentive plans to attract and retain personnel  and may require us to use alternative and more expensive forms of compensation for this purpose 
the failure to obtain certain forms of model construction data from our customers or others could harm our business 
we must develop or obtain a reliable source of sufficient amounts of current and statistically relevant data to analyze transactions and update our products 
in most cases  these data must be periodically updated and refreshed to enable our products to continue to work effectively in a changing environment 
we do not own or control much of the data that we require  most of which is collected privately and maintained in proprietary databases 
customers and key business alliances provide us the data we require to analyze transactions  report results and build new models 
if we fail to maintain sufficient sourcing relationships with our customers and business alliances  or if they decline to provide such data due to legal privacy concerns  competition concerns  
table of contents prohibitions or a lack of permission from their customers  we could lose access to required data and our products might become less effective 
in addition  certain of our insurance solutions products use data from state workers compensation fee schedules adopted by state regulatory agencies 
third parties have asserted copyright interests in these data  and these assertions  if successful  could prevent us from using these data 
any interruption of our supply of data could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our business could be harmed 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret  and trademark laws  and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology 
this protection of our proprietary technology is limited  and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent 
in addition  patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications  and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
any disclosure  loss  invalidity of  or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position  and ultimately  our business 
there can be no assurance that our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that others  including our competitors  will not use our proprietary technology without our consent 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
some of our technologies were developed under research projects conducted under agreements with various us government agencies or subcontractors 
although we have commercial rights to these technologies  the us government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies developed by us under these contracts  and in some cases can terminate our rights in these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis 
under these contracts with the us government  the results of research may be made public by the government  limiting our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on our research 
if we are subject to infringement claims  it could harm our business 
with recent developments in the law that permit patenting of business methods  we expect that products in the industry segments in which we compete  including software products  will increasingly be subject to claims of patent infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow 
we may need to defend claims that our products infringe patent  copyright or other rights  and as a result we may incur significant defense costs or substantial damages  be required to cease the use or sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or license a substitute non infringing technology  discontinue the use of some technology  or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available or might require substantial royalties or license fees that would reduce our margins 
security is important to our business 
breaches of security  or the perception that e commerce is not secure  could harm our business 
our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of consumer and other sensitive information 
internet based  electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks and several of our products are accessed through the internet  including our consumer services 
table of contents accessible through the www 
myfico 
com website 
security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services  including products and services utilizing the internet  or well publicized security breaches and the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents  could significantly harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities  discovery of new vulnerabilities  attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems  data thefts  physical system or network break ins or inappropriate access  or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our net sourced products  consumer services and proprietary database information 
protection from system interruptions is important to our business 
if we experience a sustained interruption of our telecommunication systems it could harm our business 
systems or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our ability to develop  deliver or maintain our products and services  causing harm to our business and reputation and resulting in loss of customers or revenue 
these interruptions can include fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  equipment failures and other events beyond our control 
risks related to our industry our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services 
if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services  our revenues may decline 
we have a significant share of the available market in portions of our scoring solutions segment and for certain services in our strategy machine solutions segment specifically  the markets for account management services at credit card processors and credit card fraud detection software 
to increase our revenues  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services  such as direct marketing  healthcare  insurance  small business lending  retail  telecommunications  personal credit management  the design of business strategies using strategy science technology and internet services 
these areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel 
products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products 
if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services  our revenues will decrease 
if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies  our products could become less competitive or obsolete 
in our markets  technology changes rapidly  and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware  network operating systems  programming tools  programming languages  operating systems  database technology and the use of the internet 
if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology or industry standards  our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete 
for example  the rapid growth of the internet environment creates new opportunities  risks and uncertainties for businesses  such as ours  which develop software that must also be designed to operate in internet  intranet and other online environments 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies  use leading third party technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise  anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs  
table of contents initiate new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
if our competitors introduce new products and pricing strategies  it could decrease our product sales and market share  or could pressure us to reduce our product prices in a manner that reduces our margins 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors  and this inability could impair our capacity to sell our products 
the market for business analytics is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition in this market to persist and intensify 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope of the products and services they offer  and include in house analytic and systems developers  scoring model builders  enterprise resource planning erp and customer relationship management crm packaged solutions providers  business intelligence solutions providers  providers of credit reports and credit scores  providers of automated application processing services  data vendors  neural network developers and artificial intelligence system builders  third party professional services and consulting organizations  providers of account workflow management software  managed care organizations  and software tools companies supplying modeling  rules  or analytic development tools 
we expect to experience additional competition from other established and emerging companies  as well as from other technologies 
for example  certain of our fraud solutions products compete against other methods of preventing credit card fraud  such as credit cards that contain the cardholder s photograph  smart cards  cardholder verification and authentication solutions and other card authorization techniques 
many of our anticipated competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  professional services and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to develop  promote and sell their products 
many of these companies have extensive customer relationships  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
furthermore  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition  our ability to expand our business and sell our products will be negatively affected 
our competitors may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as part of integrated suites of several related products 
this ability may cause our customers to purchase products from our competitors that directly compete with our products 
price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins  and could also harm our ability to obtain new long term contracts and renewals of existing long term contracts on favorable terms 

table of contents government regulations that apply to us or to our customers may expose us to liability  affect our ability to compete in certain markets  limit the profitability of or demand for our products  or render our products obsolete 
if these regulations are applied or are further developed in ways adverse to us  it could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislation and governmental regulation affects how our business is conducted and  in some cases  subject us to the possibility of future lawsuits arising from our products and services 
legislation and governmental regulation also influence our current and prospective customers activities  as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
both our core businesses and our newer consumer initiatives are affected by regulation  including the following significant regulatory areas federal and state regulation of consumer report data and consumer reporting agencies  such as the fair credit reporting act fcra  the fair and accurate credit transactions act facta  which amends fcra  and certain proposed regulations under facta  presently under consideration  regulations designed to combat identity theft and loss of data  such as facta and other regulations modeled after the current california security breach notification act  that require consumer notification of security breach incidents and additional federal and state legislative enactments in this area  regulations designed to insure that lending practices are fair and non discriminatory  such as the equal credit opportunity act ecoa  privacy laws  including but not limited to the provisions of the financial services modernization act of fsma  the gramm leach bliley act glba  and the health insurance portability and accountability act of hippa and similar state privacy laws  regulations governing the extension of credit to consumers and by regulation e under the electronic fund transfers act  as well as non governmental visa and mastercard electronic payment standards  fannie mae and freddie mac regulations  among others  for our mortgage services products  insurance regulations related to our insurance products  a broad array of consumer protection laws  for example federal and state statutes governing the use of the internet and telemarketing  regulations of foreign jurisdictions on our international operations  including the european union s privacy directive  and sarbanes oxley act sox regulations to verify internal process controls and require material event awareness and notification 
in making credit evaluations of consumers  performing fraud screening or user authentication  our customers are subject to requirements of federal law  including fcra  facta and ecoa  and regulations thereunder  as well as state laws which impose a variety of additional requirements 
privacy legislation such as glba and fsma  or consumer data security standards  may also affect the nature and extent of the products or services that we can provide to customers as well as our ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
in addition to existing regulation  changes in legislative  judicial  regulatory or consumer environments could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  the facta amendments to fcra will result in new regulation 
these regulations or the interpretation of these amendments could affect the demand for or profitability of some of our products  including scoring and consumer products 
state regulation could cause financial institutions to pursue new strategies  reducing the demand for our products 
in addition  legislative reforms of workers compensation laws that aim to simplify this area of regulation and curb abuses could diminish the need for  and the benefits provided by  certain of our insurance solutions products and services 

table of contents our revenues depend  to a great extent  upon conditions in the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries 
if any of our clients industries experience a downturn  it could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  of our revenues were derived from sales of products and services to the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries 
a downturn in the consumer credit  the financial services or the insurance industry  including a downturn caused by increases in interest rates or a tightening of credit  among other factors  could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of our large institutional customers have merged and consolidated in recent years  we have generated most of our revenue growth from our bankcard related scoring and account management businesses by selling and cross selling our products and services to large banks and other credit issuers 
as this industry continues to consolidate  we may have fewer opportunities for revenue growth due to changing demand for our products and services that support customer acquisition programs of our customers 
in addition  industry consolidation could affect the base of recurring revenues derived from contracts in which we are paid on a per transaction basis if consolidated customers combine their operations under one contract 
there can be no assurance that we will be able effectively to promote future revenue growth in our businesses 
risk related to external conditions if any of a number of material adverse developments occur in general economic conditions and world events  it could affect demand for our products and services and harm our business 
during the economic slowdown in the united states and in europe in recent years  companies in many industries delayed or reduced technology purchases  and we experienced softened demand for our decisioning solutions and other products and services 
if the current improvement in economic conditions in the us and europe slows or reverses or if there is an escalation in regional or continued global conflicts or terrorism  we may experience reductions in capital expenditures by our customers  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased price competition  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in operations outside the united states  we are subject to unique risks that may harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a growing portion of our revenues is derived from international sales 
during fiscal  of our revenues were derived from business outside the united states 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors arising out of international commerce  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the general economic and political conditions in countries where we sell our products and services  difficulty in staffing and efficiently managing our operations in multiple geographic locations and in various countries  the effects of a variety of foreign laws and regulations  including restrictions on access to personal information  import and export licensing requirements  longer payment cycles  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  currency fluctuations  changes in tariffs and other trade barriers  and difficulties and delays in translating products and related documentation into foreign languages 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term 
additionally  some of our business will be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are not currently material to our cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  an increase in our foreign revenues could subject us to increased foreign currency transaction risks in the future 
our anti takeover defenses could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of fair isaac  thereby limiting the demand for our securities by certain types of purchasers or the price investors are willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
these provisions include adoption of a rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill  and giving our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 
due to changes in accounting rules  we will incur significant stock based compensation charges related to employee stock options in future periods 
in december  the financial accounting standards board published statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  which will require us to measure all share based payment awards  including stock options  using a fair value method and record such expense 
this change will first be reflected in the presentation of our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this standard will have a significant negative impact on our consolidated net income and net income per share and may inhibit our use of stock option based compensation in the future 
there is uncertainty as to the ability of other forms of compensation to attract and retain employees  as well as the financial and other consequences of such forms of compensation 
if we experience changes in tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns  it could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws  by our ability to generate taxable income in foreign jurisdictions in order to utilize foreign tax losses  and by the valuation of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from such examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition
