liquidity and capital resources during  dura provided cash from operations of million  compared to million in cash generated from operations before changes in working capital items was million for compared to million for working capital generated cash of million in compared to million in this slight increase in cash generated from working capital is primarily the result of the timing of accounts receivable and cash payments partially offset by an increase in inventory due to certain facility consolidation actions and the strengthening of the european currencies in relation to the us dollar 
net cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million in in  million was used for acquisitions  of which million was used for the final purchase price for the reiche acquisition and million was used for the working capital adjustment for the creation group acquisition 
this compares to the million that was used for the acquisition of the creation group  in net capital expenditures totaled million in compared to million in the capital expenditures were primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases related to new or replacement programs 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million for as compared to million provided in the net cash used in was principally for the net repayment of outstanding indebtedness of million partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
net cash provided in was primarily related to financing activities during as a result of cash provided from the offering of percent senior unsecured notes senior notes  due april of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of approximately million partially offset by debt issuance costs incurred related to issuance of the senior notes of approximately million and net repayments of outstanding indebtedness of approximately million 
net cash flow used in discontinued operations was million for as compared to million provided in the net cash flow from discontinued operations in is the result of less favorable settlements of retained liabilities 
the net cash flow from discontinued operations in is a result of the realization of the net current assets of discontinued operations existing at december  of approximately million  partially offset by the loss from operations incurred during prior to the disposal 
the loss from operations is net of adjustments resulting from final negotiations surrounding the disposal of approximately million and net negative adjustments recorded during as a result of less favorable settlement of retained liabilities than anticipated of approximately million 
in march  dura entered into its credit agreement 
the credit agreement originally provided for revolving credit facilities of million  a million tranche a term loan  a million tranche b term loan and a million interim term loan facility 
in april  dura completed the offering of million percent senior unsecured notes senior notes  due april the interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually beginning october  net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used to repay the outstanding balance of the million tranche a term loan  and a portion of the million tranche b term loan 
dura then replaced the remaining tranche b term loan with a million tranche c term loan 
in addition  the revolving credit facility was decreased to million 
borrowings under the tranche c term loan are based on libor and are due and payable in quarterly installments through december with no early payment penalties 
in conjunction with these transactions  dura obtained an amendment to the credit agreement to allow for the senior notes offering and to further adjust certain financial covenants 
dura also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap notional amount of million with various financial institutions that more closely mirrors the cost of its bank debt 
in connection with the repayment of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  dura wrote off debt issuance costs of approximately million during the second quarter of in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   dura reclassified the million loss on early extinguishment of debt to a component of income from continuing operations and the related income tax benefit of million to the provision for income taxes 
in november  dura completed the senior notes offering of million 
the interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually beginning april  net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used to replenish cash balances used to fund the acquisition of the creation group 
in conjunction with this transaction  dura amended and restated its revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement provides for million of revolving credit  available until october at december   dura had unused borrowing capacity of approximately million  of which million was available under its most restrictive debt covenant and million in letters of credit outstanding 
no borrowings under the revolving credit facility occurred during the existing tranche c term loan remains outstanding 
dura also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap notional amount of million with various financial institutions that more closely mirrors the cost of its bank debt 
in connection with the termination of dura s credit agreement  dura wrote off debt issuance costs of approximately million during the fourth quarter of the write off of debt issuance costs was classified as a component of income from continuing operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
included in interest expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations is approximately million  million and million of interest income earned on dura s cash balances in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   the rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was based on libor and was percent 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants which amongst other things  limit indebtedness  investments  capital expenditures and certain dividends 
the credit agreement also requires dura to maintain certain financial ratios including debt and interest coverage 
dura was in compliance with the covenants as of december  borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all assets of dura 
the credit agreement provides dura with the ability to denominate a portion of its revolving credit borrowings in foreign currencies up to an amount equal to million 
as of december   dura had no borrowings outstanding under the revolver 
dura also utilizes uncommitted overdraft facilities to satisfy the short term working capital requirements of its foreign subsidiaries 
at december   dura had overdraft facilities available from banks of approximately million  of which  it had no borrowings outstanding 
in april  dura completed the offering of its subordinated notes  due may the interest on the subordinated notes is payable semiannually 
net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used to repay the million interim term loan  approximately million to retire other indebtedness  and approximately million was used for general corporate purposes 
in june  dura completed a similar offering of percent senior subordinated notes due may with a face amount of million 
the interest on these notes is also payable semiannually 
unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were approximately million  yielding an imputed interest rate of percent 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
these notes are collateralized by guarantees of certain of dura s subsidiaries 
dura automotive systems  inc dasi is a holding company whose sole source of operating income and cash flow is derived from dura operating corp 
doc and whose only material asset is the capital stock of doc 
doc is limited under its various financing arrangements in its ability to declare or make certain dividend payments or other distributions to dasi 
specifically  under the credit agreement  dasi and doc are prohibited paying dividends on account of their respective capital stock  subject to certain exceptions  including  among others  payments required on dura s trust preferred securities and dividends or stock repurchases by dasi utilizing of its cumulative net income arising after december  provided that after giving effect to such payment its total debt to ebitda would be less than or equal to to under the terms of the indentures relating to the senior notes and subordinated notes  doc is restricted in its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to dasi unless certain conditions are satisfied  including that the cumulative amount of such dividends or distributions does not exceed the sum of of its consolidated net income of net loss from march   proceeds received from equity sales  restricted investments and contributions of productive assets since that date 
these restrictions are subject to certain exceptions  including  among others  payments made to dasi i to pay ordinary operating expenses not to exceed million per year  ii to make certain required tax payments  iii to make distributions as required under dura s preferred securities 
dura s principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under its million revolving credit facilities 
dura intends to rely primarily on cash generated from operations after satisfying its working capital and capital expenditure needs to reduce indebtedness 
dura generated cash from operations of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
dura s willingness to use its excess cash to repay indebtedness prior to its scheduled maturity  however  is subject to current industry conditions and its liquidity needs 
during  dura accumulated significant cash in lieu of repaying indebtedness due in part to lower north american production volumes and higher steel prices 
as a result  dura had cash of million as of december  dura expects that capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
these capital expenditures will be used primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases and facility improvements 
in february  dura amended its credit agreement to  among other things  adjust the total leverage  senior leverage and interest coverage ratios that it was required to maintain over the next six quarters beginning march  in addition  dura repaid million of the tranche c term loan 
dura believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement as amended  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
dura s ability to service its indebtedness will depend on its future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
certain of these factors are beyond dura s control 
dura believes that  based upon current levels of operations  it will be able to meet its debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among other things  that dura will continue to be successful in implementing its business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in its business  liquidity or capital requirements 
dura s business strategies include the maximization of cash flow available for debt reduction by executing planned operating efficiencies and implementing a disciplined capital expenditure program see item a business business strategy for a more detailed discussion and description of our business strategies and their potential impact on our liquidity and capital resource position 
if dura cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness and to meet its other obligations and commitments  dura might be required to refinance its debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
there is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of the credit agreement 
in the event that dura is unable to refinance the credit agreement or raise funds through asset sales  sales of equity or otherwise  its ability to pay principal of  and interest on  its debt would be impaired 
contractual obligations the following table presents dura s contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period more less than two three four five than five total one year years years years long term debt      senior notes   subordinated notes   capital lease obligations and other noncurrent liabilities  mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities   interest expense a      pension and post retirement projected benefits      operating leases b      total      a interest expense obligations were calculated holding interest rates constant as of december  b operating leases include lease commitments of million that are recorded in facility consolidation cost reserves 
in addition to the obligations noted above  dura has obligations reported as other long term liabilities that consist principally of obligations for facility closure and consolidation costs and warranty and environmental liabilities 
at december   dura is not party to any significant purchase obligations for goods or services 
off balance sheet arrangements dura uses standby letters of credit to guarantee its performance under various contracts and arrangements  principally in connection with its workers compensation liabilities with insurers 
these letters of credit contracts expire annually and are usually extended on a year to year basis 
at december   dura had outstanding letters of credit of million 
dura does not believe that they will be required to be drawn 
dura currently has no non consolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
significant accounting policies dura s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of dura s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
dura recognizes revenue as its products are shipped from its facilities to its customers  which is when title passes to the customer for substantially all sales 
dura enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life to produce products 
once such agreements are entered into by dura  fulfillment of the customers purchasing requirements is the obligation of dura for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to seven years  and dura generally has no provisions to terminate such contracts 
in certain instances  dura may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to its customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such product 
in such situations  dura records a liability for the estimated amount of such future losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and are recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill dura s obligations to its customers 
the estimated amount of such losses as of december  and were not significant 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  and  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
it was amortized over years 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized  but is instead subjected to annual impairment testing in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
other intangible assets at december  are approximately million primarily consisting of non amortizable trademarks and amortizable license agreements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   dura adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 dura completed step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test  using a combination of valuation techniques  including the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiple approach  for each of its four reporting units control systems  body glass  mobile products and other operating companies 
upon completion of the required assessments under sfas no 
 it was determined that the fair market value of the goodwill assigned to dura s control systems and other operating companies reporting units was lower than its book value  resulting in a transitional impairment charge of approximately million  representing the write off of percent of the control systems reporting unit goodwill and percent of the other operating companies reporting unit goodwill 
the write off was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in dura s consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended march  under the valuation techniques and approach applied by dura in its sfas no 
analysis  if a change in certain key assumptions is applied  such as the discount rate  projected future cash flows and mix of cash flows by geographic region  it could significantly impact the results of dura s assessment 
at may   holding other variables constant  a fifty basis point increase in the discount rate used by dura in its sfas no 
analysis would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
dura performs impairment tests annually  during the second quarter  and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired 
based upon dura s annual assessment during  no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has occurred 
accounting for income taxes 
dura accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements dura estimates its income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process includes an assessment of temporary differences which result from the differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within dura s consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred tax balances are adjusted to reflect tax rates  based on currently enacted tax laws  which will be in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that included the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining dura s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
dura has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred tax assets  primarily certain net operating loss carryovers 
the valuation allowance is based on dura s review of all available positive and negative evidence  including its past and future performance in the jurisdictions in which it operates  the market environment in which it operates  the utilization of tax attributes in the past  the length of carryback and carryforward periods in jurisdictions and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or dura adjusts these estimates in future periods  the effects of these adjustments could materially impact dura s financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
in addition  during and  dura recorded total losses from discontinued operations of million related to the disposition of the mechanical assemblies europe business 
dura has not recorded tax benefits for these losses as it believes it is more likely than not that such losses will not be realized 
dura operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
upon audit  these taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with dura s tax treatment of certain items 
consequently  the actual liabilities with respect to any year may be determined long after financial statements have been issued 
dura establishes tax reserves for estimated tax exposures 
these potential exposures result from varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations  case law and interpretations 
the settlement of these exposures primarily occurs upon finalization of tax audits 
however  the amount of the exposures can also be impacted by changes in tax laws and other factors 
on a quarterly basis  dura evaluates the reserve amounts in light of any additional information and adjusts the reserve balances as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the probable outcomes 
dura believes that it has established the appropriate reserves for these estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the resolution of these tax matters in a particular future period could have a material impact on dura s consolidated statement of operations and provision for income taxes 
defined benefit plans and postretirement benefits 
dura sponsors defined benefit type plans that cover certain hourly and salaried employees in the us and certain european countries 
dura s policy is to make annual contributions to the plans to fund the normal cost as required by local regulations 
in addition  dura has nine postretirement medical benefit plans for certain employee groups and has recorded a liability for its estimated obligation under these plans 
in calculating obligation and expense  dura is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
dura s assumptions are determined based on current market conditions  historical information and consultation with and input from its actuaries 
dura has historically used september as its annual measurement date 
for  dura assumed discount rates of to percent for its pension benefits  and percent for its postretirement benefits other than pensions to determine its benefit obligations 
holding other variables constant such as expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase  a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would have increased dura s expense by million and obligations by million 
dura employs a building block approach in determining the expected long term rate of return for plan assets  based on historical markets  long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income and considering current market factors such as inflation and interest rates 
holding other variables constant such as discount rate and rate of compensation increase a one percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased dura s expense by million 
dura expects to contribute million to its pension plans and million to its postretirement medical benefit plans in dura employs a total return on investment approach in managing pension plan assets whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
at september   dura s measurement date  its domestic pension assets are comprised of equity securities  debt securities and other investments cash 
this asset allocation is substantially different from dura s preferred allocation due to the transferring of us plan assets to a new pension asset manager on october  as of september  these us plan assets were held in cash prior to the transfer to the new manager 
dura s preferred asset allocation is approximately percent equity securities and percent bond securities 
at september   dura s measurement date  its foreign pension assets are comprised of equity securities  debt securities and other investments cash 
specifically related to dura s postretirement medical benefit plans  assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for these plans 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have decreased dura s expense by approximately million and postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
while any negative impact of these significant accounting policies would generally result in non cash charges to earnings  the severity of any charge and its impact on stockholders investment could adversely affect dura s borrowing agreements  cost of capital and ability to raise external capital 
dura s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed its disclosure in this management discussion and analysis 
geographical results of operations dura s results of operations by geographic region are impacted by various factors including vehicle production volumes  foreign exchange and general economic conditions 
dura sells its products to every major north american  asian and european automotive oem and most rvsv oems 
dura has manufacturing and product development facilities located in the us  brazil  canada  china  czech republic  france  germany  mexico  portugal  slovakia  spain and the uk 
dura also has a presence in japan and india through alliances or technical licenses 
dura has initiated plans to open a manufacturing facility in romania to support eastern european automakers in dura s foreign business has been increasing as a percentage of total revenue due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar and lower north american automotive production volumes 
foreign currency positively impacted revenue by million in and in partially offsetting these items during was the full year impact of the creation group acquisition completed in july and a record production year in the recreation vehicle industry  which are predominately domestic businesses and together positively impacted domestic revenue by million in dura s revenue as compared to was further impacted geographically by dura s run out of its conventional window regulator business with revenue of million  which was a domestic business 
geographically  dura has experienced significant variability in income from continuing operations between each of the last three years 
dura s domestic income from continuing operations has decreased over this period and foreign income from continuing operations has been relatively consistent 
dura s profitability in the domestic region weakened in as compared to due to the reduction in automotive production volumes  increased interest expense due to higher average interest rates  and the impact of steel was felt more severely in dura s domestic operations as steel pricing increased more significantly in north america during dura s profitability in the domestic region weakened in as compared to due to the reduction in automotive production volumes  the run out of the conventional window regulator business which was a domestic business  the elimination of certain intercompany borrowings resulting in the elimination of interest income in the domestic region and interest expense in the foreign regions  and the refinancing of third party debt under dura s credit agreement in april  which moved essentially all of dura s interest expense to the domestic region 
dura s profitability in the foreign region weakened in as compared to due to an increase in facility consolidation costs  higher overall material costs and a negative net impact from foreign exchange 
dura s profitability in the foreign region strengthened in as compared to due to operational improvements resulting from the execution of facility consolidation actions  the elimination of certain intercompany borrowings resulting in the elimination of interest income in the domestic region and interest expense in the foreign regions  and the positive impact of new business 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality dura typically experiences decreased revenues and operating income during the third calendar quarter of each year due to production shutdowns at oems for model changeovers and vacations 
the rvsv market is seasonal in that sales in the fourth quarter are normally at reduced levels 
effects of inflation inflation potentially affects dura in two principal ways 
first  a significant portion of dura s debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates which may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
in many cases  dura has limited ability to pass through inflation related cost increases due to the competitive nature of the markets that dura serves 
in the past few years  other than material costs  inflation has not been a significant factor 
market risk dura is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
dura does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
dura enters into financial instruments to manage and mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
dura manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed below  dura had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair market value of dura s debt at december  by approximately million  million of which relates to dura s interest rate swap agreements see below  and would be expected to have an estimated reduction in pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
at december   dura had outstanding interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted million of its senior notes into floating rate obligations 
under these swap contracts  which expire in april  dura receives payments at fixed rates  while it makes payments at variable rates percent to approximately percent at december  
the net interest paid or received is included in interest expense 
dura designated these swap contracts as fair value hedges at their inception 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a net gain position for dura of approximately million  representing the estimated benefit that would accrue to dura to terminate the agreements  and is included in current and noncurrent assets with a corresponding increase to debt in the accompanying consolidated december  balance sheet 
from time to time  dura also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions 
dura may designate such contracts at their inception as a cash flow hedge 
at december   dura had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
foreign currency transactions a significant portion of dura s revenues during the year ended december  were derived from manufacturing operations in europe  canada and latin america 
the results of operations and the financial position of dura s operations in these countries are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in such countries are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which revenues are generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a significant portion of dura s assets at december  are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  dura s consolidated stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
dura s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon conducting its operations in such countries respective currency and dura may  from time to time  engage in hedging programs intended to reduce dura s exposure to currency fluctuations see discussion above on market risk
