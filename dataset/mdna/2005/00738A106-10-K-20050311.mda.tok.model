item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  and services a broad range of high speed network access products utilized by providers of telecommunications services and enterprise end users 
we currently sell our products to a large number of service providers  including the four largest telecommunications providers  and to private and public enterprises worldwide 
sales increased this year compared to last year due to our strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
the year over year increase in our systems revenue is primarily attributable to increasing sales of dslams  optical access products  m multiplexers  and netvanta products 
our dslams consolidate broadband traffic and provide the technology that allows phone companies to compete with cable companies in the high speed internet service market 

table of contents the year over year increase in high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl t revenue is primarily attributable to increasing carrier networks sales of hdsl based total access broadband platform products  partially offset by declining enterprise networks sales of channel service units data service units csu dsu products 
the increase in hdsl revenue is the result of migration from non intelligent legacy hardware to intelligent remote monitoring access hardware and a result of market share gains 
the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu 
the year over year decrease in digital business transport dbt total reach sales is the result of newer and higher speed technologies replacing the lower speed technology of isdn and dds products 
we have maintained our overall market share in dbt total reach and continue to take advantage of market opportunities for these products where speed is not the main consideration 
however  dbt total reach is a declining market  which is being cannibalized by higher speed dsl technology 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we normally operate with very little order backlog 
the majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
furthermore  many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
further  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory which may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of such inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed and determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the applicable terms of each respective contract  generally fob shipping point 
in the case of consigned inventory  revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
we record revenue associated with installation services when the installation and all contractual obligations are complete 
when contracts include both installation and product sales  the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item 
either the purchaser  adtran  or a third party can perform installation of our products 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
the majority of enterprise networks products are sold in the united states through a non exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors and system integrators 
these large distribution organizations then sell to an extensive network of value added resellers and system integrators 
value added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel partner  or they may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion 
our distributors may return products to us that are damaged or defective upon receipt for replacement 
additionally  our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock balancing purposes when such returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale  and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents prior to accepting a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that had previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve had been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we recorded million and million of bad debt expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   improving financial conditions among our customers allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts by million  resulting in a credit of million to bad debt expense 
we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on a monthly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period 
therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is to emphasize total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
these objectives are achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
during  we changed our fixed income investment policy  shortening the maximum maturity from years to five and one half years  with consistent dollar maturities  year to year 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration a wide range of objective and subjective information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
for  and  we recorded other than temporary write downs of our marketable equity investments of  and million  respectively 
these write downs are included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we also invest in privately held entities and record our investments in these entities at cost 
we review our investments in these entities periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
for  and  we recorded write downs of our cost basis investments of million  and million  respectively 
these write downs are included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

table of contents we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
for  and  we recorded a valuation allowance of million  million and  respectively 
this valuation allowance is included in non current deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate our cost to repair or replace defective products at the time revenue is recognized and include this cost in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income 
our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  shipment volumes  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our estimates change in the future  the liability for warranty returns we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future cost of goods sold expense

in connection with the preparation of this report  we concluded that it was appropriate to classify our auction rate municipal bonds and variable rate municipal demand notes as current investments 
previously  such investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents 
accordingly  we have revised the classification to report these securities as short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and we have also made corresponding adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended december   and  to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
this change in classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from financing activities in our previously reported consolidated statements of cash flows  or our previously reported consolidated statements of income for any period 
at december  and  we held million and million  respectively  of auction rate municipal bonds and variable rate municipal demand notes classified as available for sale short term investments 
our investments in these securities are recorded at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every seven to days  and  despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities 
as a result  we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from our current investments 
all income generated from these current investments was recorded as interest income 
our working capital  which consists of current assets less current liabilities  increased from million as of december  to million as of december  the quick ratio  defined as cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and net accounts receivable  divided by current liabilities  increased from as of december  to as of december  the current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  increased from as of december  to as of december  the increase in liquidity ratios is primarily a result of our ability to generate cash from operations and a net movement of monetary assets from long term investments to short term investments and cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by purchases of company common stock and dividend payments
