item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and united therapeutics actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
united therapeutics undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise noted  all references in this section to united therapeutics and to the company  we  us or our are to united therapeutics corporation and its subsidiaries 
risks related to our business actual revenue run rates  consolidated revenues and net income or losses may differ from our projections 
in addition  we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable 
we have made public projections of our estimated remodulin annual revenue run rate  a range of potential consolidated revenues and achieving profitability in these projections were based on numerous factors and assumptions taken into consideration at the time the estimates were made 
those factors and assumptions are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty 
as a result  the actual revenues and net income or losses may be greater or less than projected 
even small differences in the factors and assumptions can lead to significant changes in our stock price 
we achieved net income of approximately million for the year ended december  prior to  we incurred net losses aggregating to million 
in addition  although we were profitable for the three month periods ended june   september   and december   we lost money from the date of our inception in through march  at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we may incur additional losses and may not stay a profitable company 
factors that could affect the accuracy of our expectations of revenue run rates  consolidated revenues  and profitability and cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the following extent and timing of sales of remodulin to distributors  level of patient demand for remodulin and other products  levels of research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses  timing of payments to licensors and corporate partners  retention and growth of patients treated with remodulin  remodulin side effects  including impact of infusion site pain and reaction from subcutaneous use of remodulin  changes in the current pricing and dosing of remodulin  willingness of private insurance companies  medicare and medicaid to reimburse remodulin at current pricing levels  impacts of new legislation and regulations and changes to the medicare and medicaid programs  diligent and timely completion  as well as the outcome  of the phase iv post marketing study of remodulin  our ability to maintain regulatory approval of remodulin in the united states and other countries  additional regulatory approvals in other countries for remodulin  status and impact of other approved and investigational competitive products  continued performance by current remodulin distributors under existing agreements  size  scope and outcome of development efforts for existing and additional products  future milestone and royalty payments  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  establishing  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  recovery of goodwill  intangible assets and investments in affiliates  collection of accounts receivable and realization of inventories  unforeseen expenses  actual growth in sales of telemedicine and arginine products  actual expenses incurred in future periods  and establishment of additional acquisitions or licensing agreements 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in clinical studies 
we might not maintain or obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell our pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if we sell our products  we may not be profitable and may not be able to sustain any profitability we achieve 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for our drug products or if third party payers limit the amount of reimbursement  our sales will suffer 
our commercial success depends heavily on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of our pharmaceutical products 
third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs 
remodulin and the associated infusion pump and supplies are very expensive 
intravenous infusion of remodulin was just approved in november and payers may or may not agree to reimburse it 
we believe our investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
in the past  medicare has not reimbursed the full cost of the therapy for some patients 
third party payers may not approve our new products for reimbursement or continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement 
if third party payers do not approve a product of ours for reimbursement or limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will suffer  as patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
we rely on third parties to develop  market  distribute and sell most of our products and those third parties may not perform 
we are currently marketing products in three of our five therapeutic platforms remodulin in the prostacyclin analog platform  the heartbar and other product lines in the arginine formulations platform  and cardiopal cardiac event monitors and holter monitors in the telemedicine platform 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute or sell most of our products and intend to rely substantially on experienced third parties to perform all of those functions 
we may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might not be able to obtain marketing approvals and sell our products 
medtronic minimed is our exclusive partner for the subcutaneous delivery of remodulin using the minimed microinfusion device for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
we are relying on medtronic minimed s experience  expertise and performance 
similarly  we are relying on accredo therapeutics  inc  priority healthcare corporation and caremark  inc to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
if our partners and contractors do not achieve acceptable profit margins  they may not continue to distribute our products 
if our partners in the united states and internationally are unsuccessful in their efforts  our revenues will suffer 
if we cannot maintain regulatory approvals for our products  we cannot sell those products and our revenues will suffer 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacturing  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals we receive in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
product approvals  if granted  can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products 
the fda has approved remodulin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
this approval is subject to the requirement that we perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
continued fda approval of remodulin is subject to the diligent and timely completion of that trial  as well as its outcome 
the phase iv clinical trial was required to be one half enrolled by june and must be fully enrolled by june  however  the fda has permitted an interim assessment and opportunity to terminate the phase iv study after only patients have completed the study 
the final study report is required to be submitted in december to date  we have only enrolled patients in this patient phase iv trial 
enrolling patients in this study is difficult  in part because it involves randomizing some of the patients to placebo despite the fact that approved drugs are available for these patients 
we are not currently enrolling the phase iv trial within the time frame specified by the fda  and therefore are at risk of the fda at any time instituting a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
we are in discussions with the fda about our due diligence in enrolling the phase iv trial and have made a proposal which we believe will ensure that we are able to provide interpretable results of this trial by the december final study report delivery deadline 
specifically  we have proposed that the fda evaluate the results of the phase iv trial based on the number of patients enrolled through september  the fda is reviewing our proposal 
the fda could  among other things  accept this proposal  grant us an extension of time to continue to enroll the trial  or institute a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
if a withdrawal hearing were instituted by the fda  we would pursue the opportunity to participate as we believe that we have exercised good faith due diligence in pursuing enrollment of this trial 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin 
during the year ended december   our remodulin sales accounted for of our total revenues 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  we cannot sell that product and our revenues will suffer 
in addition  if product approvals are withdrawn  governmental authorities could seize our products or force us to recall our products 
our products may not be commercially successful because physicians and patients may not accept them 
even if regulatory authorities approve our products  these products may not be commercially successful 
we expect that most of our products  including remodulin  which is already approved by the fda  will be very expensive 
patient acceptance of and demand for our products will depend largely on the following factors acceptance by physicians and patients of our products as safe and effective therapies  willingness of payers to reimburse and the level of reimbursement of drug and treatment costs by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  pricing of alternative products  convenience and ease of administration of our products  and prevalence and severity of side effects associated with our products  including the infusion site pain and reaction associated with the use of subcutaneous remodulin and the potential for infections associated with intravenous remodulin 
we may not successfully compete with established drug companies 
we compete with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  access to licenses  expertise  personnel and third party collaborators 
we will also compete with these companies following approval of our products 
almost all of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we do 
we are aware of existing treatments that compete with our products 
for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  approved products that compete with remodulin include the intravenous prostacyclin  flolan  marketed by glaxosmithkline plc  the inhaled prostacyclin  ventavis  marketed by cotherix  inc  and tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist marketed by actelion  ltd 
products that are being developed that may also compete with remodulin include sitaxsentan being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc  and ambrisentan  being developed by myogen  inc 
in december  pfizer  inc submitted an application seeking fda permission to market sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
currently  pfizer markets sildenafil as viagra for erectile dysfunction 
many companies are marketing and developing products containing arginine which will compete with the heartbar product line 
cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for ovarian and other cancers and hepatitis that will compete with products in our immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform and glycobiology antiviral agent s platform 
we have limited experience with manufacturing and depend on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of our products 
prior to the acquisition of synquest  inc  a company that manufactured treprostinil  the bulk active ingredient in remodulin  we had no experience with manufacturing 
presently  treprostinil is being manufactured only by us 
we rely on third parties for the manufacture of all our products other than treprostinil 
we rely on baxter healthcare corporation for the formulation of remodulin from treprostinil 
we rely on cardinal health inc for stability studies on remodulin and to analyze other products that we are developing 
we rely on mnemonics inc to manufacture our telemedicine devices and nellson nutraceutical and garden state nutritionals to manufacture our arginine products 
we rely on other manufacturers to make our investigational drugs for use in trials 
although there are a limited number of companies that could replace each of these suppliers  management believes that other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in distribution of remodulin and other products  and in the conduct of clinical trials and commercial launch  which would adversely affect our research and development efforts and future sales efforts 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of our products have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales  delays in scale up to commercial quantities could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  we and manufacturers of our products are subject to the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign standards  and although we control compliance issues with respect to synthesis and manufacturing conducted internally  we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our third party manufacturers  if we have to change to another manufacturing contractor or abandon our captive manufacturing operations  fda and comparable foreign regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections and the new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the production of the affected product  we may not be able to develop or commercialize our products  other than remodulin  as planned or at all and will have to rely solely on internal manufacturing capacity  in the future  we intend to transfer all of our drug laboratory operations to the silver spring  maryland facility currently being built  and such transfer could result in manufacturing inefficiencies or delays  without substantial experience in operating a manufacturing facility  we may not be able to successfully manufacture remodulin without a third party manufacturer  and we may not have intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to many improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for our products 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of our products  entail higher costs and result in our being unable to effectively sell our products 
if our products fail in clinical studies  we will not be able to obtain or maintain fda and foreign approvals and will not be able to sell those products 
in order to sell our pharmaceutical products  we must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  we must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that the drug product  including its delivery mechanism  is safe and effective 
if we cannot obtain approval from the fda for a product  that product cannot be sold  and our revenues will suffer 
we are currently conducting a phase iv clinical study for remodulin 
for a description of the status of this phase iv study  see our discussion above under risk factors if we cannot maintain regulatory approvals for our products  we cannot sell those products and our revenues will suffer 
we have initiated a phase ii clinical study of an inhaled formulation of treprostinil and phase i studies of an oral formulation of remodulin 
our lead glycobiology antiviral agent  ut b  recently completed a phase ii  proof of concept study 
in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
we are now planning a trial in patients who responded positively to conventional treatments to determine if ut b can prevent disease relapse in such patients 
we are also currently conducting two phase iii pivotal studies of ovarex for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer 
we are still completing or planning pre clinical studies for our other products 
our ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  or physicians think that the drug is not effective  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  including site pain  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  drug supplies are not available or suitable for use in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in clinical trials 
in addition  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated that our products are safe and effective 
discoveries or developments of new technologies by others may make our products obsolete or less useful 
other companies may conduct research  make discoveries or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or not commercially viable 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies to treat the diseases for which our products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
one therapy recently approved in the united states in is tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist developed by actelion  ltd 
which competes with remodulin 
more recently  in december  ventavis  an inhaled prostacyclin developed by cotherix  inc  was approved in the united states 
ventavis will also compete with remodulin 
we are aware that other endothelin antagonists are being developed  such as sitaxsentan by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc and ambrisentan by myogen  inc in december  pfizer  inc 
submitted an application seeking fda permission to market sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
currently  pfizer markets sildenafil as viagra for erectile dysfunction 
other approved or investigational therapies for pulmonary hypertension could be used in combination with remodulin 
if this happens  doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin given to their patients 
this could result in less remodulin being used by such patients and  hence  reduced sales of remodulin 
if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we would lose our right to develop and sell the products covered by the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products which have been discovered and initially developed by others  including remodulin  all of the products in the immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform  all of the products in the glycobiology antiviral agents platform  and the heartbar line of products 
under our product license agreements  we retain ownership of the intellectual property subject to the terms of each license agreement  whereas assignment agreements transfer all right  title and ownership of the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of each assignment agreement 
in addition  we have obtained licenses to other third party technology to conduct our business  including licenses for our products and an alliance agreement for the use of the medtronic minimed microinfusion device for the administration of remodulin 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technology to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence has the following risks we may not be able to obtain future licenses  assignments and agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignments are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products  the licenses and assignments that we hold generally provide for termination by the licensor or assignor in the event we breach the license or assignment agreement  including failing to pay royalties and other fees on a timely basis  in the event that glaxosmithkline formerly glaxo wellcome terminates its assignment agreement or pfizer formerly pharmacia terminates its license agreement  we will have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
for the year ended december   sales of remodulin accounted for approximately of our revenues 
glaxosmithkline or pfizer could seek to terminate the assignment in the event that we fail to pay royalties based on sales of remodulin  and if licensors fail to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our license and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products and may be forced to incur substantial additional costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
if our patent and other intellectual property protection is inadequate  our sales and profits could suffer or competitors could force our products completely out of the market 
the united states patent for the method of treating pulmonary hypertension with remodulin was originally set to expire in the patent for ovarex and its method of use are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents have expiration dates ranging from to we believe that some of the patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures in europe and in the united states under the waxman hatch act 
for instance  in february under waxman hatch  the united states patent relating to the method of treating pulmonary hypertension using remodulin was extended by five years  giving the product patent protection until october  in addition  patent extensions are available under similar laws in europe 
we may not be able to extend these or any other patents 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as our products  including remodulin  and market those products after the patents expire  or may design around our existing patents 
if this happens  our sales would suffer and our profits could be severely impacted 
patents may be issued to others which prevent the manufacture or sale of our products 
we may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of the patents in order to keep marketing our products 
this would cause profits on sales to suffer 
we have been granted patents in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but patent applications that have been  or may in the future be  filed by us may not result in the issuance of additional patents 
the scope of any patent issued may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we intend to sell our products may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may not be effective in protecting our proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to our know how 
litigation  which is very expensive  may be necessary to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights and may not end favorably for us 
we are currently a party to pending litigation initiated by us against other parties believed to have violated our patents related to our arginine products line 
we may also choose to initiate litigation against other parties who we come to believe are infringing these patents 
if such litigation is unsuccessful or if the patents are invalidated or canceled  we may have to write off the related intangible assets and such an event could significantly reduce our earnings 
any of our licenses  patents or other intellectual property may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and may not provide any competitive advantage to us 
if our highly qualified management and technical personnel leave us  our business may suffer 
we are dependent on our current management  particularly our founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  our president and chief operating officer  roger jeffs  phd  our executive vice president for business development and chief financial officer  fred hadeed  and our executive vice president for strategic planning  general counsel and corporate secretary  paul mahon  all of whom are employed pursuant to multi year employment agreements 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on these officers 
our success will depend in part on retaining the services of our existing management and key personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology is not generally available in the market  and competition for qualified management and personnel is intense 
we may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims 
the testing  manufacture  marketing  and sale of human drugs involve product liability risks 
although we currently have product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence  we may not be able to maintain this product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all  and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses 
if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
we may not have  or may have to share rights to  future inventions arising from our license  assignment and alliance agreements and may lose potential profits or savings 
pursuant to our agreements with certain business partners  any new inventions or intellectual property that arise from our activities will be owned jointly by us and these partners 
if we do not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or we have to share the rights with others  we will lose the benefit of the new rights which may mean a loss of future profits or savings generated from improved technology 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales may be limited 
we may need to spend more money than currently expected because we may need to change our product development plans or product offerings to address difficulties with clinical studies  to prepare for commercial sales or to continue sales of remodulin 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are not available  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for securities of drug and biotechnology companies are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  january  december  our stock price could decline suddenly due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts or our projections  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or by others  changes in or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of remodulin by medicare or medicaid  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our existing stockholders  results of clinical trials  future sales of common stock by our directors and officers  failure to maintain approvals to sell remodulin  timing and outcome of additional regulatory approvals  and general market conditions 
future sales of shares of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if our stockholders transfer their ownership of our common stock or sell a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market  or investors become concerned that substantial sales might occur  the market price of our common stock could decrease 
each of our four executive officers has announced their adoption of b trading plans 
in accordance with these plans  twice each month the executives sell a specified number of our common stock either owned by them or acquired through the exercise of stock options 
in addition  toray industries inc has an option to acquire  shares of our common stock and piggyback registration rights with respect to such shares that arise if and when this option becomes exercisable 
a decrease in our common stock price could make it difficult for us to raise capital by selling stock or to pay for acquisitions using stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholders may incur additional dilution 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and rights plan could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that could be beneficial to us and our public stockholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors and may frustrate accumulations of large blocks of common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
this may further result in discouraging a change of control or change in current management 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial block of our stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and named executive officers beneficially owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock as of february  including stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of that date 
accordingly  these stockholders as a group might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of our directors 
such stockholder influence could delay or prevent a change of control with respect to us 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain our earnings for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
executive officers of the registrant the following is a list  as of february   setting forth certain information regarding the executive officers of united therapeutics 
each executive officer holds office until the first meeting of the board of directors after the annual meeting of stockholders  and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal 
each executive officer s employment will end pursuant to the terms of his or her employment contract 
each of the employment contracts generally provide for an initial term of service of five years which may be renewed after each year for additional one year periods

these statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of united therapeutics as to future outcomes and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause united therapeutics results to differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in risk factors 
united therapeutics undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview united therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of unique products for patients with chronic and life threatening cardiovascular  cancer and infectious diseases 
united therapeutics commenced operations in june and  since its inception  has devoted substantially all of its resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
united therapeutics products and services united therapeutics lead product is remodulin 
on may   the united states food and drug administration fda approved subcutaneous use of remodulin treprostinil sodium injection for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life threatening condition characterized by elevated blood pressures between the heart and lungs 
united therapeutics was required to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
continued fda approval of remodulin is subject to the diligent and timely completion of that phase iv trial  as well as its outcome 
the study was originally to have been completed by may and involve patients 
in mid  the fda agreed to amend the due date of the final study report and make other changes to the trial design including reducing the number of patients to the amended phase iv clinical trial was required to be one half enrolled by june and must be fully enrolled by june  however  the fda has permitted an interim assessment and opportunity to terminate the phase iv study after only patients have completed the study 
the final study report is required to be submitted in december to date  only patients have been enrolled in this patient phase iv trial 
enrolling patients in this study is difficult  in part because it involves randomizing some of the patients to placebo despite the fact that approved drugs are available for these patients 
united therapeutics is not currently enrolling the phase iv trial within the time frame specified by the fda  and therefore is at risk of the fda at any time instituting a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
united therapeutics is in discussions with the fda about its due diligence in enrolling the phase iv trial and has made a proposal which united therapeutics believes will ensure that it is able to provide interpretable results of this trial by the december final study report delivery deadline 
specifically  united therapeutics has proposed that the fda evaluate the results of the phase iv trial based on the number of patients enrolled through september  the fda is reviewing this proposal 
the fda could  among other things  accept this proposal  grant an extension of time to continue to enroll the trial  or institute a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
if a withdrawal hearing were instituted by the fda  united therapeutics would pursue the opportunity to participate as it believes that it has exercised good faith due diligence in pursuing enrollment of this trial 
on november   the fda approved intravenous infusion of remodulin  based on data establishing its bioequivalence with the previously approved subcutaneous administration of remodulin  for patients who are not able to tolerate a subcutaneous infusion 
this approval was also conditioned upon the diligent and timely completion of the phase iv trial  as well as its outcome 
remodulin is also approved for subcutaneous use in canada  israel  australia and switzerland 
marketing authorization applications are currently under review in france  and other countries 
united therapeutics has generated revenues from sales of remodulin and arginine products in the united states and other countries 
in addition  united therapeutics has generated revenues from telemedicine products and services  primarily designed for patients with cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease  in the united states 
united therapeutics has funded its operations from the proceeds of sales of its common stock and from revenues from the sales of its products and services 
remodulin marketing and sales remodulin is sold and marketed to patients in the united states by accredo therapeutics  inc  priority healthcare corporation and caremark  inc and outside of the united states by international distributors 
united therapeutics sells remodulin in bulk shipments to these distributors 
the timing and extent of united therapeutics sales of remodulin are impacted by the timing and extent of these bulk orders from distributors 
bulk orders placed by distributors are determined by them  based on their estimates of the amount of drug required for current and newly starting patients  as well as an inventory equivalent to approximately thirty to sixty days demand as a contingent supply since discontinuation of therapy can be life threatening to patients 
therefore  sales of remodulin to distributors in any given quarter may not be indicative of patient demand in that quarter 
sales of remodulin and remodulin delivery pumps and supplies are recognized as revenue when delivered to the distributors 
future prospects while united therapeutics was profitable during most of  it incurred net losses for all periods from inception through march  at december   united therapeutics had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
united therapeutics may continue to incur net losses and cannot provide assurances that  in the future  it will be profitable 
future profitability will depend on many factors  including timely and successful completion of the remodulin phase iv study discussed above under united therapeutics products and services  the price  level of sales  level of reimbursement by public and private insurance payers  and the number of patients using remodulin and other currently commercialized products and services  as well as the results and costs of research and development projects 
major research and development projects the major research and development projects of united therapeutics are the use of remodulin to treat cardiovascular diseases  immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate a patient s immune response to treat a variety of cancers and glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small molecules that may be effective as oral therapies to treat infectious diseases 
cardiovascular disease projects subcutaneous use of remodulin was approved by the fda in may for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in nyha class ii iv patients to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
a condition of continued fda approval is that a phase iv clinical study must be completed in a timely and diligent manner as discussed above under united therapeutics products and services 
remodulin was also approved in canada  israel  australia and switzerland for similar uses 
regulatory applications and reviews of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension are ongoing in other countries 
material net cash inflows from the sales of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension commenced in may after fda approval was received 
in  united therapeutics filed an investigational new drug application and performed animal toxicology and human bioequivalence studies to support intravenous use of remodulin 
based on positive results of these studies  in january  united therapeutics filed a supplemental new drug application snda with the fda for intravenous use of remodulin in pulmonary arterial hypertension 
on november   the fda approved the intravenous use of remodulin  based on data establishing its bioequivalence with the previously approved subcutaneous administration of remodulin  for patients who are not able to tolerate a subcutaneous infusion 
this approval was also conditioned on the diligent and timely completion of the phase iv trial described above  as well as its outcome 
remodulin was also being evaluated for the treatment of critical limb ischemia the advanced stage of vascular disease affecting blood vessels in the legs 
united therapeutics commenced a patient placebo controlled pre pivotal clinical study of remodulin for critical limb ischemia in approximately patients were enrolled 
the study was ended before becoming fully enrolled due to difficulties in recruiting patients for the study 
united therapeutics believes that more convenient formulations of remodulin  such as an oral form  may be more appropriate for patients with peripheral vascular disease 
united therapeutics is in the early stages of developing oral and inhaled formulations of treprostinil 
during  united therapeutics completed dosage studies of oral formulations of remodulin in healthy volunteers and filed an investigational new drug application on january  to perform an additional study 
during  independent clinical investigators performed small uncontrolled trials of inhaled formulations of treprostinil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
united therapeutics is currently planning a controlled trial of another formulation of inhaled remodulin in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on remodulin development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on remodulin development 
cancer disease projects united therapeutics monoclonal antibody immunotherapies were licensed in april from altarex medical corp 
ovarex mab is the lead product and is currently being studied in two identical phase iii clinical trials in advanced ovarian cancer patients 
these studies  which commenced in january  are being conducted at approximately centers throughout the united states and are expected to be fully enrolled in the next to months 
these studies could take up to two years to complete following full enrollment  depending on trial patients relapse rates 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on ovarex development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on ovarex development 
infectious disease projects united therapeutics infectious disease program includes glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in the preclinical and clinical stages of testing 
the drugs in this program are being developed for hepatitis c  hepatitis b and other infectious diseases 
the first candidate for hepatitis c  ut b  completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies to assess safety in healthy volunteers in early phase ii clinical studies in patients infected by hepatitis c were initiated in july and were completed in october in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
united therapeutics is now planning a trial in patients who responded positively to conventional treatments in order to determine if ut b can prevent disease relapse in such patients 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  for its infectious disease programs 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for infectious disease programs 
project risks due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development  regulatory review and approval processes  the anticipated completion dates  the cost of completing the research and development and the period in which material net cash inflows from these projects are expected to commence are not known or estimable 
there are many risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of the products discussed above  including the following products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  the drugs may not be safe and effective or may not be perceived as safe and effective  other approved or investigational therapies may be viewed as safer  more effective or more convenient  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  patients may not enroll in the studies at the rate united therapeutics expects  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials or to manufacture drugs  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  higher than anticipated costs may be incurred due to the high cost of contractors for drug manufacture  research and clinical trials  drug supplies may not be sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in clinical trials 
if these projects are not completed in a timely manner  regulatory approvals would be delayed and united therapeutics operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  united therapeutics could not commercialize and sell these products and  therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products would be delayed or impossible to achieve 
financial position cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments including all unrestricted and restricted amounts at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase of approximately million is due primarily to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling approximately million  offset by million used to purchase property  plant and equipment 
restricted cash and marketable investments pledged to secure united therapeutics obligations under the synthetic operating lease discussed below under off balance sheet arrangement at december  totaled approximately million  as compared to none at december  accounts receivable  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to increased sales of remodulin in the last quarter of as compared to sales of remodulin in the last quarter of prepaid expenses at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to a greater level of prepayments for research and development related goods and services at december  property  plant and equipment at december  was approximately million  as compared to million at december  the increase was due primarily to the purchase of a lot adjacent to united therapeutics headquarters for million 
other non current assets at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  included in this amount at december  was an escrow of approximately million which was used in june to purchase a lot adjacent to united therapeutics headquarters on which construction of the new laboratory facility has commenced 
total liabilities at december  were approximately million  as compared to total liabilities of approximately million at december  and consisted primarily of trade payables  accrued expenses and amounts due to affiliates 
the increase was due primarily to a guarantee of approximately  related to the laboratory construction and lease arrangements discussed below under off balance sheet arrangement  and increases of approximately million in accrued expenses for medicaid rebates and royalty liabilities 
total stockholders equity at december  was approximately million  as compared to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity of approximately million was due primarily to net income earned during the year ended december  and the proceeds from exercises of stock options of approximately million 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended in thousands december  december  remodulin telemedicine services and products other products total revenues revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to growth in patients using remodulin and the price increase discussed below 
the impact of the price change was to increase revenues from remodulin by approximately million for the year ended december  total revenues are reported net of estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees due to a distributor for services 
government rebates are paid to state medicaid agencies that pay for remodulin 
united therapeutics estimates its liability for such rebates based on the volume of remodulin dispensed to medicaid patients as reported to united therapeutics by its distributors and the expected rebate per unit of remodulin as determined by united therapeutics in accordance with federal guidelines 
prompt pay discounts are offered on sales of remodulin if the related invoices are paid in full generally within days from the date of sale 
united therapeutics estimates its liability for prompt pay discounts based on historical payment patterns 
fees paid to a distributor for services are estimated based on contractual rates for specific services applied to estimated units of service provided by the distributor for the period 
a roll forward of the liability accounts associated with estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees to a distributor for services as well as the net amount of reductions to revenues for these items are presented as follows in thousands year ended december  december  liability accounts  at beginning of period additions to liability payments liability accounts  at end of period net reductions to revenues remodulin is sold to distributors in the united states at an agreed upon discount from the published average wholesale price awp and to international distributors at an agreed upon transfer price 
in  the published awp of remodulin was per milligram mg for the mg  mg and mg concentrations and per mg for the mg concentration 
in the first quarter of  the published awp for the mg concentration was increased to per mg to achieve uniform pricing 
also during the first quarter of  united therapeutics informed prescribers of remodulin that based on laboratory studies completed in late  vials containing remodulin remain stable for up to days from their first use 
previously  the period of stability had been established at days 
furthermore  in november  the fda approved package insert for remodulin was updated to reflect the day stability 
therefore  patients are expected to use remodulin vials for longer than days and  accordingly  consume fewer vials annually 
the increase in the period of stability may result in decreased future net sales of remodulin 
during  approximately one quarter of all reimbursable remodulin patients were beneficiaries under medicare 
during most of  medicare was reimbursing distributors for remodulin sold to medicare patients at a payment level that was significantly less than the acquisition price paid by these distributors to united therapeutics 
this under reimbursement by medicare was occurring with respect to approximately one half of the medicare patients  comprising only those patients using the mg ml concentration vials across all four medicare payment regions and all patients in one of the medicare payment regions 
as a result of this under reimbursement  distributors were generally incurring losses on their sales of remodulin related to medicare beneficiaries 
on october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued cms manual system  pub 
one time notification  transmittal transmittal with an effective date of january  the transmittal directed cms regional contractors known as durable medical equipment regional coordinators dmercs to reimburse all units of remodulin at the payment limit established by cms in january that payment limit is per milligram which is higher than the acquisition price paid by the distributors 
in addition  the transmittal also requires the dmercs to retroactively adjust claims brought to their attention 
accordingly  united therapeutics now believes that the under reimbursement situation has been favorably resolved 
united therapeutics distributors endeavor to maintain levels of remodulin inventories sufficient to satisfy existing and new demand for the product 
inventory levels held by united states based distributors as reported to united therapeutics by such distributors at december  were approximately million based on united therapeutics selling price 
the inventory levels at december  were approximately million 
as remodulin is not yet approved in the european union  inventory levels outside of the united states were not significant 
product returns were due to arginine products and totaled approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   expenses for remodulin related programs increased by approximately million while expenses for the infectious disease and cancer programs were reduced by approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to the remaining decrease in total research and development expenses of approximately million was related to reduced expenses in other programs 
see major research and development projects above  for additional information 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel  office expenses  insurance  professional fees  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to decreases of approximately million in sales and marketing expenses related mostly to arginine products and approximately  in travel expenses 
these decreases were offset by increases of approximately  in professional fees expenses and  in insurance expenses 
cost of sales consists of the cost to manufacture or acquire products that are sold to customers 
cost of service sales consists of the salaries and related overhead necessary to provide services to customers 
cost of product sales was approximately of product sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with approximately for the year ended december  cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with the cost of service sales of approximately for the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to an increase in cash available for investing during equity loss in affiliate represents united therapeutics share of northern therapeutics  inc s losses 
at december   united therapeutics owned approximately of northern therapeutics 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   which is consistent with approximately  for the year ended december  northern therapeutics  inc s loss is due primarily to expenditures for its autologous non viral vector gene therapy research for pulmonary hypertension and sales and marketing activities for remodulin in canada 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended in thousands december  december  remodulin telemedicine services and products other products total revenues revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to growth in patients using remodulin 
a roll forward of the liability accounts associated with estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees to a distributor for services as well as the net amount of reductions to revenues for these items are presented as follows in thousands year ended december  december  liability accounts  at beginning of period additions to liability payments liability accounts  at end of period net reductions to revenues product returns were due to arginine products and totaled approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to increased expenses of approximately million for remodulin related programs and increased expenses of approximately million for the ovarex program 
see major research and development projects  above for additional information 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to increased expenses of approximately million for salaries  travel and related expenses due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  increased expenses of approximately million in professional fees related to regulatory and intellectual property matters  and an increase in other operating expenses  such as rent  telephone  office supplies and depreciation expense  of approximately  cost of product sales was approximately of product sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately in the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was due primarily to the commercial launch of remodulin in may which has a lower cost of sales than other united therapeutics products 
cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with the cost of service sales of approximately for the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease of approximately million was attributable primarily to lower yields in and a decrease in the amount of cash available for investing as compared to the write down of investment for the year ended december  was none  as compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the investment write down in represents a loss due to an other than temporary decline in value of the investment in altarex medical corp 
for the six month period ended september   the quoted market price of altarex s common stock was consistently less than united therapeutics cost 
this was determined to be an other than temporary decline in the value of altarex s common stock held by united therapeutics 
as a result  the investment in altarex was written down to its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in september the fair value of this investment as determined by quoted market prices on december  and was equivalent to the amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets 
the loss on marketable investments for the year ended december  was none  as compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  in march  united therapeutics reported a  write down due to an other than temporary decline in value of one of its marketable investments 
in june  united therapeutics began reassessing its investment program in light of increasingly adverse conditions in the bond markets 
as a result  all marketable debt investments were sold in july a write down of investments totaling approximately million was necessary to adjust the value of united therapeutics marketable investments to their fair value based on quoted market prices at june  in july  united therapeutics recorded an additional realized loss of approximately million as a result of the liquidation of the investment portfolio 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenditures by northern therapeutics related to its autologous non viral vector gene therapy research for pulmonary hypertension and increased sales and marketing activities for remodulin in canada 
in process research development during  a subsidiary of united therapeutics acquired the assets of medicomp  inc in a purchase transaction that resulted in a write off of in process research and development related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
at the acquisition date  medicomp was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of a number of new technological innovations for next generation products 
medicomp completed the development of its automatic trigger heart monitor during the new cardiopal ai monitor utilizes this technology and was launched in medicomp was also pursuing development of a wireless heart monitor system 
during  united therapeutics determined that alternative wireless technologies existed that could be utilized more feasibly than the technology acquired from medicomp 
therefore  the wireless heart monitor project as acquired from medicomp will not be completed but will  instead  utilize third party wireless technologies 
this change is not expected to have a material impact on united therapeutics 
liquidity and capital resources until june  united therapeutics financed its operations principally through private placements of common stock 
on june   united therapeutics completed its initial public offering 
net proceeds to united therapeutics from the initial public offering and sale of the over allotment shares  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
in  united therapeutics issued common stock in two private placements and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
until  united therapeutics funded the majority of its operations from such net proceeds of equity 
during  united therapeutics funded the majority of its operations from revenues  mainly remodulin related  and this is expected to continue 
in addition  on february   united therapeutics filed a primary shelf registration statement with the sec to enable united therapeutics to offer and sell up to five million shares of its common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the shelf registration statement will provide united therapeutics the flexibility to take advantage of future financing opportunities on terms that united therapeutics considers advantageous  which terms would be established at the time of any such offering 
the sec has not as of the date of filing this annual report on form k declared such registration statement effective 
united therapeutics working capital at december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in cash flow from operations and stock option exercises 
current liabilities at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase is due primarily to an increase in remodulin related medicaid rebates and royalty liabilities due to increased sales of remodulin 
united therapeutics debt at december  was approximately  and consisted of equipment leases as compared with  at december  at december   total debt included a mortgage note totaling approximately  which was paid off in january net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to growth in sales and collections from remodulin 
for the years ended december  and  united therapeutics invested approximately million and million  respectively  in cash for property  plant and equipment 
these amounts were used primarily to acquire land and buildings in and united therapeutics made milestone payments totaling  pursuant to existing license agreements during the year ended december  united therapeutics is obligated to make royalty payments on sales of remodulin which exceed annual net sales of million and on all arginine products 
royalties on sales of all products currently marketed will range up to percent of sales of those products 
in december  a subsidiary of united therapeutics acquired the assets of medicomp  inc and telemedical procedures  llc together referred to as medicomp 
under terms of the acquisition agreement  united therapeutics was required to issue additional shares to the sellers because the average closing price of united therapeutics common stock over the calendar days prior to the third anniversary of the acquisition was less than per share 
in august   shares of united therapeutics common stock were issued to the sellers in satisfaction of this obligation 
united therapeutics believes that its existing revenues  together with existing capital resources comprised primarily of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  will be adequate to fund its operations through factors that could cause actual results of operations to differ from these expectations include the following continued regulatory approval of remodulin in the united states and other countries  size  scope  timely completion and outcome of the remodulin post marketing phase iv clinical study  additional regulatory approvals of remodulin in other countries  retention and growth of reimbursable patients treated with remodulin  impact of infusion site pain and infusion site reaction and other remodulin side effects  changes in the current remodulin pricing and dosing  changes in the length of time that remodulin vials may be used by patients  reimbursement of remodulin by public and private payers and the level of reimbursement  impact of other approved and investigational competitive products and changes in their pricing  changes in prescribers opinions about remodulin  impact of medical and scientific opinion on united therapeutics products  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  continued performance by remodulin distributors under existing agreements  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  future milestone and royalty payments  risks associated with acquisitions  including the ability to integrate acquired businesses  actual expenses incurred in future periods  establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements  and ability of united therapeutics to maintain and grow its telemedicine and arginine revenues 
united therapeutics did not incur income tax expense for the year ended december  generally due to the availability of deductions for tax purposes which will offset any net income for these periods 
as of december   united therapeutics had available approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million in business tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes that expire at various dates through united therapeutics is currently conducting a study to determine whether any limitations under section of the internal revenue code have been triggered 
preliminary results of this study indicate that a limitation occurred in november as a result  portions of these carry forward items that were generated prior to november will be subject to certain limitations on their use 
united therapeutics does not believe that these limitations will cause the net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards to expire unused 
off balance sheet arrangement in june  united therapeutics entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  wachovia will fund up to million towards the construction of the laboratory facility on ground owned by united therapeutics 
the construction phase commenced in and is expected to be completed in early following construction  wachovia will lease the laboratory facility to united therapeutics with a term ending in may under the year ground lease  wachovia will pay fair value rent to united therapeutics for use of the land both during the construction phase and after the laboratory lease is terminated 
during the term of the laboratory lease  wachovia will pay per year to united therapeutics for use of the land 
upon completion of the construction  wachovia will receive rents from united therapeutics generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
these rents will be paid monthly from the time that the laboratory construction is completed until the termination of the lease in may upon termination of the lease  united therapeutics will generally have the option of renewing the lease subject to approval of both parties  purchasing the laboratory at a price approximately equal to the funded construction cost or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
united therapeutics has guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least percent of the amount it funded towards the construction 
in addition  united therapeutics agreed to pledge  as collateral  a portion of its marketable investments to secure its lease obligations 
at december   approximately million of marketable investments and cash were pledged as collateral and are reported as restricted marketable investments and cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
this arrangement allows united therapeutics to construct its laboratory facility without using its own working capital 
united therapeutics will manage the construction and incur construction costs 
wachovia will then reimburse these construction costs each month as they are incurred 
united therapeutics will make rent payments to wachovia starting when construction of the facility is completed and through the lease termination in may there will not be any depreciation expense associated with the laboratory facility  since these improvements will be owned by wachovia 
the amount of rent to be paid to wachovia will vary as it is tied to the then current day libor rate plus approximately basis points 
as this rate increases  so will the rents to be paid 
similarly  if this rate decreases  then the amount of rent to be paid to wachovia will also decrease 
united therapeutics anticipates that rent payments will commence in early  after completion of construction  and continue through termination of the lease in may based on construction costs of up to approximately million and the current effective rate of approximately percent equivalent to the current day libor rate plus approximately basis points at december   the rents to be paid could approximate  annually 
in addition  wachovia has paid to united therapeutics ground rent totaling an aggregate of approximately  that will be recognized in income ratably through may united therapeutics has guaranteed a minimum residual value of the laboratory facility 
this guaranteed residual is generally equal to percent of the amount funded by wachovia towards construction 
if  at the end of the lease term  united therapeutics does not renew the lease or purchase the improvements  then the building will be sold to a third party 
in that event  united therapeutics has guaranteed that wachovia will receive at least this residual value amount 
the maximum potential amount of this guarantee is approximately million  equivalent to percent of expected total construction costs of million 
united therapeutics has estimated the fair value of this guarantee liability at approximately  and this amount is classified as a non current liability in its balance sheet at december  the lease and other agreements with wachovia require that  among other things  united therapeutics maintain a consolidated current ratio of not less than and a consolidated net worth of at least million 
the agreements contain other covenants and conditions with which united therapeutics must comply throughout the construction and lease periods and upon termination of the lease 
if united therapeutics was unable to comply with these covenants and conditions  the agreements could terminate if the noncompliance was uncured and the parties could not agree otherwise 
a termination of these agreements could result in united therapeutics acquiring the improvements from wachovia or the loss of its liquid collateral 
if the agreements are terminated during the construction period due to united therapeutics default  then united therapeutics could be required to purchase the improvements 
during construction  the amount united therapeutics would be required to pay is limited to percent of the construction costs 
contractual obligations at december   united therapeutics had contractual obligations coming due approximately as follows in thousands payment due in to to and total later capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position milestone payments operating lease obligations include the estimated lease payments on the laboratory facility being constructed in silver spring  maryland 
the lease is expected to commence in early and will expire in may the lease payments will generally be equal to applying the current day libor rate plus approximately basis points approximately percent at december  to the cost of the construction of the laboratory 
upon termination of the lease  united therapeutics will generally have the option of renewing the lease  purchasing the laboratory or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
united therapeutics has guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least percent of the amount it funded towards the construction 
it is estimated that the laboratory will cost approximately million to construct and the guarantee is estimated at approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the guarantee is included in other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position 
see off balance sheet arrangement for additional information 
united therapeutics has licensed certain products from other companies under certain license agreements 
these agreements generally include milestone payments to be paid in cash by united therapeutics upon the achievement of certain product development and commercialization goals set forth in each license agreement 
total milestone payments under these license agreements have been estimated based on the estimated timing of these development and commercialization goals 
summary of critical accounting policies remodulin revenue recognition product sales of remodulin are recognized when delivered to distributors  which are united therapeutics customers for remodulin 
product sales of remodulin delivery pumps and related supplies are recognized when delivered to distributors on a gross basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
title to these products passes upon delivery 
had the net basis been applied  the amounts of revenues and cost of product sales reported in the consolidated financial statements would have been lower  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
prompt payment discounts  government rebates and fees to a distributor customer are estimated and recognized as reductions of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
had these discounts  rebates and fees not been reported as reductions of revenue  the amounts reported as revenues and selling expenses would have been higher  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
return policies provide that product that has expired or become damaged in shipment may be replaced  but not returned 
therefore  reserves for exchanges are not recorded unless product expiration or damage occurs 
the shelf life of remodulin is two years from the date of its manufacture 
united therapeutics relies on its distributors to report damage in shipment or expirations of remodulin product 
one of united therapeutics remodulin distribution agreements stipulates minimum quarterly purchases by the distributor 
the distribution agreement  however  does not permit the distributor to return remodulin product solely based on the distributor s ability or inability to resell the product 
as such  revenues from sales to this distributor are recognized in the period that the remodulin product is delivered to the distributor 
during the twelve month periods ended december   and  approximately million  million  and none of remodulin products were sold to this distributor and recognized as revenue  respectively 
intangible assets united therapeutics adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 on january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test that is performed on october st of each year 
united therapeutics continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   management believed that goodwill was not impaired and therefore no impairment losses have been recorded 
this conclusion is based on management s judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the reporting units which have reported goodwill 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
marketable investments currently  united therapeutics invests portions of its cash in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
due to united therapeutics intent and ability to hold these marketable debt investments until their maturities  these investments are reported at their amortized cost 
united therapeutics believes that it is able to hold these investments to maturity  due to the significant level of cash and cash equivalents it has 
if united therapeutics did not have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity  it would have reported them in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair market values 
at december   the amortized cost of these debt securities was approximately million and their fair values were approximately million 
earnings loss per share in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  for the periods with net income  the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is included in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share using the treasury stock method 
for periods with a net loss  the effect of outstanding stock options is antidilutive and is excluded from the calculation of dilutive loss per share 
stock options united therapeutics applies the principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock options issued to its employees 
the following table details the pro forma results had united therapeutics applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for its employee options in thousands years ended december  net income loss  as reported less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards pro forma net income loss investments in affiliates the equity method of accounting is used to account for most of united therapeutics investments in affiliates 
the equity method of accounting generally requires united therapeutics to report its share of the affiliates net losses or profits in its financial statements  but does not require that assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of the affiliates be consolidated with united therapeutics consolidated financial statements 
the equity method of accounting is being applied generally due to the lack of control over these affiliates and the levels of ownership held by united therapeutics 
although united therapeutics investment in northern therapeutics exceeds percent  minority shareholders possess substantive participating rights that preclude northern therapeutics financial statements from being consolidated 
other investments in affiliates are accounted for on the cost method generally due to the lack of significant influence over these affiliates and a less than percent ownership by united therapeutics 
the cost method of accounting does not require that united therapeutics report its share of the affiliates net losses or profits in its financial statements  nor are affiliates assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses consolidated with united therapeutics consolidated financial statements 
the investment in virexx medical corporation formerly altarex medical corp 
is accounted for as an available for sale security because its stock is publicly traded 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair values in the balance sheet 
changes in their fair values are reported as other comprehensive income or loss 
declines in values that are considered other than temporary are reported as losses in the statement of operations 
for the year ended december   the fair value of the investment in virexx increased by approximately million as compared to an increase in fair market value of approximately million for the year ended december  based on quoted market prices 
these increases were reported as other comprehensive income 
during  a reduction in the fair value of the investment in virexx was considered other than temporary and the million decline was reported as a loss in the statement of operations 
options issued in exchange for license in june  in connection with the license from toray industries for the sustained release formulation of beraprost an oral prostacyclin analog  united therapeutics agreed to grant options to purchase  shares of common stock to toray upon toray s adequate documentation of sustained release beraprost in humans and its transfer of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the united states 
these options will not be priced until toray has met this milestone 
if and when the milestone is met  the options would be granted at the fair market value of united therapeutics common stock at that time 
before toray can produce the clinical trial material  it will need to complete formulation  preclinical testing and early clinical studies 
due to the uncertainties in drug development  it is not yet known if toray will provide the appropriate clinical trial material 
therefore  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  these options are measured at their lowest aggregate fair value at each interim reporting date  which amount has been zero 
as a result  no expense related to these options has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
lease of laboratory facility in june  united therapeutics entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
the total amount of the construction is expected to be million 
the laboratory facility will be owned by wachovia  which will act as the lessor  and united therapeutics will be the lessee and pay rents to wachovia once the facility is completed 
this arrangement is a form of off balance sheet financing under which wachovia will fund percent of the costs for the construction of the property and lease the laboratory facility to united therapeutics 
united therapeutics has provided a residual value guarantee which guarantees wachovia that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
in accordance with the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  eitf issue no 
 implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions  including those involving special purpose entities  eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  and fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  united therapeutics has determined that the lease is properly classified as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
furthermore  united therapeutics has determined that wachovia has sufficient substance such that it can be treated as an unrelated entity to united therapeutics and  accordingly  does not require consolidation into united therapeutics financial statements 
operating leases of assets do not require that the leased asset and the related rent obligation be reported in the lessee s balance sheet  but rather be disclosed 
in contrast  capital leases do require that the leased asset and rent obligations be reported in the lessee s balance sheet as assets and debt 
changes in the equity participation by wachovia and its affiliates under the agreements could affect the classification of the lease from operating to capital 
in that event  united therapeutics would include both the assets and debt associated with the laboratory facility on its balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement statement r will be adopted by united therapeutics on july  as permitted by statement  united therapeutics currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values over the expected period of service 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the full impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had united therapeutics adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
united therapeutics is unable to estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
other than temporary impairment in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the effective date of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf issue no 
has been delayed by the fasb 
united therapeutics does not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
inventory costs in december  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
inventory cost  which is an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
sfas clarifies the accounting treatment of certain expenses for inventory costing 
the new standard will be effective for the first fiscal year beginning after june  united therapeutics has not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   a substantial portion of united therapeutics assets were comprised of debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
likewise  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to minimize such market risk  united therapeutics holds such instruments to maturity at which time these instruments will be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   united therapeutics had approximately million in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately percent maturing through march and callable annually 
the fair market value of this portfolio at december  was approximately million 
in june  united therapeutics entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  united therapeutics will pay rents to wachovia generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
the total amount of construction is estimated to be approximately million 
at december   the total amount incurred related to the construction was approximately million 
rents will be paid monthly from the time that the laboratory construction is completed until the termination of the lease in may these rents  therefore  are subject to the risk that libor will increase or decrease during the period until termination in may at december   the day libor was approximately percent 
for every movement of basis points percent in the day libor rate  the rents under this lease could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis
