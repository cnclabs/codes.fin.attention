the company s marketable securities currently consist of pennsylvania tax free state and municipal bonds  equity securities and other short term investments 
other short term investments are classified as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets 
by their nature  these financial instruments inherently expose the holders to market risk 
the extent of the company s interest rate and other market risk is not quantifiable or predictable with precision due to the variability of future interest rates and other changes in market conditions 
however  the company believes that its exposure in this area is not material 
under its current policies  the company invests primarily in high grade marketable securities and does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
historically  the company s principal investment strategy of obtaining marketable securities with maturity dates between one and five years helps to minimize market risk and to maintain a balance between risk and return 
the equity securities owned by the company consist primarily of stock held in large capitalized companies trading on public security exchange markets 
the company s management continually monitors the risk associated with its marketable securities
