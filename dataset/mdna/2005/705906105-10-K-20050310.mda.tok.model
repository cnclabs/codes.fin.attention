overview pegasus is a global leader in providing technology and services to hotels and travel distributors 
founded in  our customers include a majority of the world s travel agencies and more than  hotel properties around the globe 
our services include central reservation systems  electronic distribution services  commission processing and payment services  property management systems  and marketing representation services 
our representation services  including utell by pegasus and unirez by pegasus  are used by nearly  member hotels in approximately countries  making pegasus the hotel industry s largest third party marketing and reservations provider 
we have offices in countries  including regional hubs in london  scottsdale and singapore 
after several difficult years for the hotel industry  the year ended december  showed gradual but steady recovery in both reservation volumes and average daily room rates 
pegasus benefited from both the improved economic and industry environments as well as the december strategic acquisition of unirez  inc strength in foreign currencies  particularly the euro and the british pound  also favorably impacted pegasus 
offsetting these benefits  increased competition resulted in reduced pricing on contract renewals and new business 
in addition  an increase in the percentage of internet reservations made at hotel chain internet sites versus third party internet sites negatively impacted our distribution services revenues 
due to the improved operating environment  we increased discretionary spending in with a focus on customer satisfaction  sales  marketing  product development and employee retention activities intended to promote long term growth 
we also incurred additional expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of organizationally  we made leadership changes in key functional areas during  particularly our information technology and product management groups 
we also established or enhanced processes throughout the company with the goal of expediting the time to market on new products and improving customer satisfaction 
during this transition period  we still met our earnings goals and made significant progress on product development priorities established at the beginning of the year 
because our management approach  organizational structure  operating performance assessment and reporting  and operational decision making are performed from a single company perspective  we operate as one reportable segment 
dependence on the hotel industry our business is sensitive to changes in the demand for  and average daily rates associated with  hotel rooms 
historically  after periods of low demand for hotel rooms  average daily rates have lagged behind the recovery in transaction volumes 
since our distribution and reservation services revenues are primarily transaction based  revenues for these services have recovered more quickly than our hotel representation and financial services  which are based in large part on a combination of reservation volume and average daily rates 
in addition  we have experienced a lengthening in the sales and implementation cycle for some of our services 
revenues representation services 
we offer a variety of hotel representation services to independent hotels and small hotel groups through our utell by pegasus and unirez by pegasus services 
representation services revenues primarily consist of reservation processing fees  membership fees and fees for various marketing services 
representation services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for reservation services 
we provide crs services on an asp basis 
reservation services revenues consist of transaction fees as well as maintenance and support fees related to our rezview crs software 
reservation services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for financial services 
our financial services provide comprehensive commission processing and payment solutions to hotels  other travel suppliers and travel agencies 
financial services revenues consist of both travel agency and hotel fees 
travel agency fees are based on a percentage of the value of hotel commissions processed by us on behalf of participating travel agencies 
revenues from travel agency fees can vary substantially from period to period based on the demand for hotel rooms  the types of hotels such as upscale or economy at which reservations are made and fluctuations in overall room rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  some participating hotels generally pay fees based on the number of commissionable transactions that pegasus processes for the hotel 
financial services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for distribution services 
our distribution services provide the connections and interfaces that enable hotels to distribute their rates and inventory to and receive reservations from the four gdss used by travel agencies worldwide  a growing number of tour operators  wholesalers  and a variety of internet sites powered by pegasus 
distribution services revenues primarily consist of transaction fees  commissions and monthly subscription or maintenance fees 
in addition  new hotel customers typically pay a one time fee for establishing the connection between the hotel s central reservation system and the electronic distribution technology 
new third party internet site customers typically pay a one time fee for establishing the connection between the third party internet site and our electronic distribution technology  which is amortized over the related contract period 
distribution services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for property services 
property services revenues primarily consist of maintenance and support fees related to legacy pmss acquired from rez and gets 
in addition  property services revenues include fees from our pegasuscentral pms  which are recognized monthly 
the company remains committed to pegasuscentral and expects to resume billing the intercontinental hotel group properties currently using pegasuscentral in property services represented approximately percent of service revenues for other services 
pegasus regularly seeks to develop new services to capitalize on its existing technology and customer base and to provide additional electronic hotel reservation capabilities and information services to its existing customers and to other participants in the travel distribution process 
pegasus has not received a material amount of revenue from these services  and we cannot assure you that any of these services will produce a material amount of revenue in the future 
customer reimbursements 
revenues applicable to customer reimbursements are primarily related to gds fees that we pay on behalf of and subsequently bill our customers 
in the future  if our customers decide to pay these vendors directly  our customer reimbursements revenue and customer reimbursements cost of services will decrease accordingly 
pegasus billings for out of pocket expenses  such as third party vendor gds and telecommunication charges  are classified as customer reimbursements  which is a component of total revenues  and the related costs are classified as customer reimbursements  which is a component of total costs of services 
costs our costs of services  which exclude depreciation and amortization  consist principally of personnel costs relating to information technology  customer service and telemarketing  facilities  and equipment maintenance costs 
costs of services also include the cost of customer reimbursements and certain incentive based payments 
we make incentive based payments to some demand generators  including third party internet sites  because they provide us with access to higher transaction volumes for our services than we could reach otherwise 
we also make incentive based payments to some hotels because they generate high commission volumes for our financial services 
these incentive based payments are generally either based on transaction volumes that are expensed as incurred or consist of lump sum payments that are accounted for as an asset and expensed over the contract term 
research and development costs consist principally of personnel costs  related overhead costs and fees paid to outside consultants 
general and administrative expenses are primarily personnel  legal and accounting related  bad debt and certain facilities costs 
marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising  public relations and participation in trade shows and other industry events 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of computer equipment  office furniture  office equipment and leasehold improvements  as well as amortization of software and intangible assets 
interest income primarily includes income earned on the company s investments 
interest expense primarily includes interest and amortization of capitalized issuance costs related to the million convertible debt offering 
fluctuation of foreign currencies pegasus derives a significant portion of its revenue from customers located outside the united states 
particularly in europe  fluctuations of foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar result in our earning more or less revenue and expending higher or lower in expenses than we otherwise might have earned or spent if currency exchange rates had remained stable 
years ended december  and overall  the results reflect the addition of unirez by pegasus operations and  in general  increased reservation volumes and average daily hotel room rates over the prior year 
year over year comparisons were favorable in large part due to the war in iraq  which particularly affected the first half of for our distribution service line  an increase in the percentage of internet bookings made at hotel companies proprietary internet sites continued to have a negative impact on internet transaction volumes and revenues 
in addition  reduced pricing on new contracts and renewals prevented us from realizing the full benefit of the improved economy 
operating expenses increased slightly compared to  as expected 
the increase primarily related to the following the addition of unirez by pegasus operations  an increase in the number of and rates for incentive based payments to third parties  as well as an increase in transaction volume  an increase in employee related expenses due to merit increases and bonuses in  an increase in sales and marketing efforts with a focus on increasing revenues and improving customer satisfaction  and an increase in audit fees and other internal and external costs associated with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of these expense increases were partially offset by the absence of restructure costs in the current year 
revenues 
the table and discussion below address revenue by service line for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
variance representation services reservation services financial services distribution services property services total service revenues customer reimbursements total revenues representation services revenues increased primarily due to the results of operations of unirez by pegasus  which was acquired december  and contributed million to revenues in  compared to  in utell by pegasus revenues increased  or percent  over due to a percent increase in reservations and a percent increase in adr 
the improved adr reflects a strong euro and british pound  which contributed million to the increase in representation service revenues 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in utell by pegasus membership fees due to fewer hotels in the portfolio  and a percent decrease in the average commission percentage earned  resulting from lower pricing on new contracts and contract renewals  as expected  arising out of increased competition from lower cost competitors 
reservation services revenues decreased primarily due to lower per unit pricing on contract renewals  despite a percent increase in net transactions processed 
excluding carryover revenue in early from three previously terminated contracts  reservation service revenues increased percent over prior year 
financial services revenues increased primarily as a result of a percent increase in gross commissions processed and due to improved adr and the trend of processing more foreign currency payments  which earn additional fees 
distribution services revenues decreased despite a percent increase in gds transactions and a flat number of internet transactions 
internet transaction volumes reflect an increase in the percentage of internet bookings made at hotel companies proprietary internet sites  these transactions do not utilize pegasus internet distribution services 
in addition  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to the loss of unirez as a distribution services customer  which provided million in revenue in  reduced pricing on travelweb transactions  and a decrease in revenue per transaction 
in conjunction with priceline s acquisition of travelweb  we extended terms of the services contract  but with lower pricing 
property services revenues decreased in due to lack of revenues from intercontinental hotel group for pegasuscentral and declining revenues from an acquired property management system  guestview  which we plan to sunset in this system is fully amortized  so there will not be a write down related to its discontinuance 
customer reimbursements increased primarily due to operations of our new unirez by pegasus representation service and an overall increase in our customers gds costs because of an increase in gds transactions 
operating expenses 
the table and discussion below address operating expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  dollars in thousands 
variance cost of services customer reimbursements total costs of services research and development general and administrative expenses marketing and promotion expenses depreciation and amortization restructure costs total operating expenses cost of services  excluding customer reimbursements  increased primarily due to a million in added expenses for our unirez by pegasus representation service  million of severance and related costs incurred in the first quarter of related to a strategic change in the company s information technology organization  a million increase in incentive based payments to third parties because of new contracts and increases in transaction volumes and rates  and million in increased consulting costs for it initiatives 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues was percent in both and customer reimbursements increased primarily due to operations of our new unirez by pegasus representation service and an overall increase in our customers gds costs because of an increase in gds transactions 
research and development expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to cost savings realized from the restructuring  slightly offset by  in additional expenses related the unirez acquisition 
research and development expenses as a percentage of service revenues were percent and percent in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly primarily due to  of bad debt expense in  as compared to zero in   in severance and related costs incurred in the first quarter of related to a strategic change in the company s it organization   in added expenses of unirez by pegasus  and increase of approximately  for audit and other fees related to the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in payroll related expenses and benefit plan costs because of decreased headcount in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenues were percent in and marketing and promotion expenses increased due primarily to increased personnel costs arising from unirez by pegasus  a greater focus on marketing and promotion activities  and the cost of a new sales incentive compensation program launched in january marketing and promotion expenses as a percentage of service revenues were percent and percent in and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily because certain intangible assets related to the rez acquisition were fully amortized in march this was partially offset by a million increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets from the december unirez acquisition 
during  the company incurred restructure charges of million  related to the reorganization of its operations from a business unit structure into distinct functional areas 
interest income 
interest income earned on the company s investments decreased by  in compared to as the company s funds available for investment decreased in conjunction with the stock repurchase plan cash outlays of million in interest expense 
interest expense increased by million compared to primarily related to interest and amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs for the july convertible debt offering 
gain on sale 
on may   pegasus sold its interest in travelweb  llc to an affiliate of priceline 
com  inc priceline and received million in cash  recognizing a gain of approximately million 
the sale agreement contained a contingent earn out valued at approximately million  however  we do not currently anticipate that the required conditions will be met to receive the shares of priceline common stock on the one year anniversary of the closing date 
income tax benefit expense 
pegasus recorded an income tax expense of million in  representing an effective tax rate of percent 
pegasus recorded an income tax benefit of  in  representing an effective tax rate of percent 
the effective tax rate for differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the detriment of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses  offset by the benefit of lower foreign tax rates 
years ended december  and overall  was a challenging year for the travel industry and for pegasus 
the weak economic climate in the united states  the war in iraq and the continuing threat of terrorism resulted in a decrease in the demand for hotel rooms and  therefore  negatively impacted our revenues 
also  in addition to these factors our service revenues decreased due to the loss of two crs customer contracts that contributed million of revenue in our services were organized into two business segments technology and hospitality 
during  we completed a restructure to integrate our technology and hospitality segments into one operating unit 
as a result  we integrated support functions  including sales and marketing  product development  service delivery  reservation data management  information technology  finance and human resources functions 
the integration plan continued our existing strategy of better aligning our businesses with our customers needs  thus allowing for future revenue growth and the realization of further synergies as one fully integrated company 
because we changed our management approach  organizational structure  operating performance assessment and reporting  and operational decision making from a segment perspective technology and hospitality to a single company perspective  we operate as one reportable segment 
on july   pegasus issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes through a private placement 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of percent  payable semi annually  through the maturity date of july   and are further described under liquidity and capital resources below 
pegasus used a portion of the proceeds to acquire unirez  as described above  and expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including the stock repurchases described under liquidity and capital resources below 
we were able to offset a large portion of the revenue decline by reducing our expense 
we began realizing synergies from our restructure during the third quarter of  and we had strict controls over discretionary spending such as advertising  marketing and travel during the entire year of revenues 
the table and discussion below address revenue by service line for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
variance representation services reservation services financial services distribution services property services total service revenues customer reimbursements total revenues total service revenues from continuing operations  excluding customer reimbursements excludes a million termination fee included in reservation services in march representation services revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in domestic and transatlantic bookings for our utell by pegasus service  caused primarily by the global economic climate and other world events  as well as an percent decrease in the number of hotels utell represents  as a result of pricing pressure from lower cost distribution channels 
these decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact from a strong euro and british pound relative to the us dollar and the results of operations of unirez subsequent to the december  acquisition  which contributed  to revenues 
reservation services revenues decreased percent  however  excluding the impact of the million termination fee noted above  reservation services revenues decreased million  or percent 
the decrease was primarily due to the termination of two customer contracts that provided million of revenue in  with the remaining decrease caused by lower transaction volumes and pricing pressure on contract renewals 
financial services revenues increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in electronic reconciliation and tracking services of  and an increase in fees for our pegspay service of  these increases were offset by a percent decrease in gross commissions  resulting from decreased transaction volumes and lower average daily rates charged by hotels 
distribution services revenues increased primarily due to a percent increase in internet transactions in  compared to property services revenues were essentially flat at million in and  due to delays in the rollout of pegasuscentral because of stability issues 
customer reimbursements increased due to an increase in our customers gds costs 
operating expense 
the table and discussion below address operating expenses for the year compared to the year dollars in thousands 
variance cost of services customer reimbursements total costs of services research and development general and administrative expenses marketing and promotion expenses depreciation and amortization restructure costs total operating expenses cost of services  excluding customer reimbursements  decreased primarily due to a million reduction in payroll and related expenses  mostly due to the company s restructuring 
this decrease was offset by non recurring costs of million incurred in for moving the company s scottsdale office and data center to new facilities and transition activities resulting from the company s restructure 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues was percent and percent in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in capitalized payroll costs associated with an increase in the number of projects that are eligible for capitalization 
research and development expenses as a percentage of service revenues were percent in and general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and operating expenses  due to the company s restructuring  as well as reductions in discretionary spending in light of the challenging operating environment 
these decreases were slightly offset by higher employee related and insurance costs in additionally  the company experienced a million reduction in bad debt expense due to an overall improvement in the collectibility of the company s accounts receivable 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenues were percent and percent in and  respectively 
marketing and promotion expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll expenses due to the company s restructuring  as well as an increased focus on reducing discretionary spending 
marketing and promotion expenses as a percentage of service revenues were percent in and the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily because in march  we completed the amortization for certain purchased intangible assets related to the rez acquisition 
during  the company incurred restructure charges of million  composed of termination benefits and facilities related charges related to reorganizing its operations from a business unit structure into distinct functional areas 
interest income 
interest income increased  in  compared to  primarily from investing a portion of the proceeds from the july convertible debt offering

interest expense was million in  compared to  in  primarily due to the july convertible debt offering 
income tax benefit 
pegasus recorded an income tax benefit of  in  representing an effective tax rate of percent 
pegasus recorded an income tax benefit of million in  representing an effective tax rate of percent 
the effective tax rate for differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the detriment of nondeductible expenses  offset by the benefit of lower foreign tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources historically  pegasus has primarily relied on cash flows from operations and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from stock option exercises to provide working capital for current and future operations and for capital investments 
from time to time  we have also utilized bank lines of credit  proceeds from equity and debt offerings and private debt to supplement our ability to fund operating cash requirements  capital investments and acquisitions 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
key indicators we use to make this assessment are current assets  current liabilities and net cash flow from operating activities 
in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes and utilized approximately half of the net proceeds to acquire unirez in december we used the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes with a portion included in our cash balance at the beginning of more details on the convertible debt are provided later in this management s discussion and analysis 
our principal sources of capital at december  included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term marketable securities of million  and auction rate securities of million 
during  we generated cash flows from operations of million  which was sufficient to provide for working capital requirements 
other sources of cash in were million of proceeds from stock option exercises and million of proceeds from selling our stake in travelweb  llc 
proceeds from stock option exercises in were higher than normal due to the departure of several executives 
proceeds from stock option exercises depend on a number of factors  including our stock price  the number and terms of stock options outstanding and the number and terms of future stock option grants 
the terms of stock options outstanding and the number and terms of future stock option grants may be affected by the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
cash outlays in were primarily related to stock repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million 
a significant component of our capital strategy during was an aggressive stock repurchase program 
in addition to the shares repurchased in  we repurchased additional shares totaling million during the first two months of as of february   there were  shares remaining for repurchase under the current board approved program 
another component of our capital strategy is investing in software development projects meeting our return on investment criteria 
our capital expenditures primarily consist of personnel costs  interest expense and outside consultant costs for software development  computer hardware  furniture  fixtures and other office equipment 
we expect to continue incurring capital expenditures related to software development and adding capacity to existing systems and estimate capital expenditures will total approximately million 
this estimate includes approximately million related to property and equipment purchases made in that will be paid for in we may also collaborate with outside parties for software development or other business needs 
the potential capital required for such arrangements is uncertain 
further  we expect our cash position at march  to be considerably lower than the december  balance 
the anticipated decrease is due to the following seasonality of our operations  timing of capital expenditures  payment of corporate bonuses  and stock repurchases 
we believe that the company s financial condition is strong 
we also believe that we will be able to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may consider liquidating our marketable securities portfolio  including our auction rate securities 
while we may obtain a bank line of credit to meet working capital needs  we do not expect to raise any external capital in the next year 
we may in the future consider other financing alternatives to fund our requirements  including possible public or private debt or equity offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that any financing alternatives sought by us will be available or will be on terms that are attractive to us 
further  any debt financing may involve restrictive covenants  and any equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders 
pegasus had two irrevocable standby letter of credit agreements with jpmorgan chase bank totaling million at december  and million at december   collateralizing the leases for the dallas and scottsdale offices 
during  as a result of an annual decrease related to the dallas facility letter of credit  the balance was reduced by  subsequent to year end  there was a further reduction of  releasing the letter of credit for the dallas facility in full and replacing it with a deposit of  convertible debt on july   pegasus issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes through a private placement 
pegasus utilized a portion of the proceeds of the offering to effect the december  acquisition of unirez 
pegasus expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including stock repurchases 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of percent  payable semi annually through the maturity date of july  each note is convertible into pegasus common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share equal to an initial conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
holders of the notes may convert their notes only if i the price of pegasus common stock reaches specified thresholds  ii the notes have been called for redemption  or iii specified corporate transactions occur 
the notes and the indenture in connection therewith contain no covenants by the company to maintain any minimum level of liquidity or any financial ratios 
pegasus may redeem all or some of the notes for cash at any time on or after july   at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
as noted above  holders may require us to purchase the notes on july of  and  or in other specified circumstances  at a purchase price equal to the principal amount due plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date and additional amounts  if any 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations pegasus currently has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the following table identifies material future contractual cash obligations of the company as of december  operating leases represent our cash obligations associated with agreements to use equipment or facilities that are enforceable and legally binding for fixed terms 
purchase obligations include cash obligations associated with agreements to purchase services or equipment that are enforceable and legally binding for fixed terms  or estimated cash obligations for agreements with variable pricing provisions 
convertible debt represents scheduled principal and interest payments for the company s july convertible debt offering  described above 
other long term liabilities include commission checks to be refunded to hotels  as well as pegasus estimated cash obligations associated with funding its employee retirement plans 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands convertible debt  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations noncash acquisitions of property and equipment other long term liabilities total in addition to the contractual obligations included in the table above  we also have funding requirements related to our executive retirement program and a united kingdom defined benefit plan  which is open to certain employees who were part of the reed elsevier pension scheme in december during  the board of directors adopted the executive retirement program  consisting of the supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers based on their compensation and years of service and the executive deferred compensation plan dcp  a defined contribution plan that provides supplemental benefits to certain management employees of the company 
commencing in  we are obligated to make annual cash payments to a trust associated with benefits earned under the executive retirement program 
the amounts funded to the trust may be available to creditors of the company  but are generally not available for use in our ongoing operations 
for  the company is required to make payments to the trust of approximately  however  the company may  at its discretion  fund additional amounts 
we expect that company contributions to the dcp in will total approximately  we expect that contributions to the united kingdom defined benefit plan in will total approximately  inflation pegasus does not believe that inflation has materially impacted results of operations during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on its results of operations to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported financial position and results of operations during the reporting period 
our estimates and judgments are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
certain accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
pegasus considers the following to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
for a detailed discussion of pegasus significant accounting policies  including recently issued accounting standards  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates  and this related disclosure in this report  with our audit committee 
accounts and notes receivables as of december   pegasus had accounts receivable as a result of its ongoing operations of approximately million 
additionally  we have notes receivable totaling million at december   related to the sale of business units 
these receivables are monitored by management for collectibility 
pegasus maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimates of losses require judgments that are based on available information and experience  such as the payment histories and known financial conditions of the parties 
these estimates are significant because pegasus may incur additional expense to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts and may receive less cash than expected if the financial condition of the parties was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
pegasus allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable totaled approximately million as of december  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill as of december   pegasus has goodwill totaling approximately million related to its acquisitions of rez  inc rez in  global enterprise technology solutions  llc gets in and unirez  inc unirez in under the guidance of sfas  goodwill is analyzed for impairment at least annually 
this analysis requires significant estimates and judgments by management  involving the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the company 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment in estimating future cash flows from operations for the various services provided by pegasus 
pegasus performs an analysis using both market capitalization and discounted future cash flows 
while the most recent periodic impairment analysis performed as of september  indicated that no impairment of goodwill exists  variances in actual growth rates  operating margins  or other assumptions may impact future impairment analyses and reduce the carrying values of goodwill 
as of december   pegasus has unamortized capitalized software costs totaling million  which we review periodically for impairment 
this impairment analysis requires the comparison of unamortized carrying values to estimated net realizable values 
the estimated net realizable value is based on significant judgments such as estimated future cash flows from the related services  or expected benefits of the software and is based on available information and experience 
while the most recent periodic impairment analysis as of december  indicated that no impairment of capitalized software costs exists  changes in strategy  market conditions or other assumptions may significantly impact these judgments and reduce the carrying values of capitalized software costs 
assumptions used in an impairment analysis of pegasuscentral  valued at million  include the number of projected property installations  primarily driven by large hotel chains  an anticipated profit margin on installations and training  variable and fixed expenses  and an estimated effective tax rate 
employee benefit plans in the united states and the united kingdom  pegasus sponsors defined benefit plans for certain employees 
our employee pension costs and obligations are dependent upon our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the salary growth assumptions are either stated in the plan or reflect our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation of the current economic environment 
specific to the plan provided in the united kingdom  which is a funded plan  a one percent change in expected returns on plan assets would result in a  change to pegasus annual expense associated with this plan 
we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields  including applicable corporate long term bond yields 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future working life of the plan participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension costs and obligations 
recently issued accounting standards information regarding recently issued accounting standards is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of the annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pegasus is exposed to certain market risks  including the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and uses derivative financial instrument contracts to manage foreign exchange risks 
pegasus has established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
company policy prohibits holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do not currently utilize hedge accounting with regard to these derivatives 
to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  pegasus was a party to various forward exchange contracts at december  these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily trade receivables and payables 
a summary of forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies in place as of december  is as follows in thousands euro british pound swedish krona japanese yen swiss franc singapore dollar australian dollar canadian dollar hong kong dollar south african rand danish krone total all contracts included above matured no later than february because of the short term nature of these contracts  the fair value approximates the contract value 
the difference between the fair value and contract value is included in the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and was not material at december  pegasus used similar forward exchange contracts and had either sell or purchase forward exchange contracts of a similarly short term nature in place on december  as of december   pegasus had approximately million in sell forward exchange contracts and  in purchase forward exchange contracts 
pegasus positions with respect to these forward exchange contracts differed as of december  compared to december  because of changes in pegasus non us denominated trade payables and receivables
