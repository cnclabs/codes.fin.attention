for a discussion of these and other factors that may impact our realization of our forward looking statements  see business risk factors within item of part i 
overview in  we focused on implementing a revitalization plan  approved by our board of directors in february  aimed at growing revenues and increasing market share by improving our sales capabilities  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the depth of our sales operations management 
the plan was built from the bottom up  market by market through the analysis of each of our staffing service offerings  and included the approval of incremental sales and fulfillment personnel in medical financial and allied mf a  in lab support and in nurse travel 
we made significant progress in strengthening our management team and field force through the hiring of seasoned professionals with staffing industry experience 
in addition to being focused on growing our existing service offerings  we added local nursing and health information management to our service lines in the healthcare staffing segment 
for the lab support segment  we focused more resources on the further development of our clinical research and engineering lines of business  launched late in during the third and fourth quarters of  we had sequential quarterly revenue growth for the first time in years as a result of the revitalization plan and a strengthening economy 
in addition  we experienced year over year revenue growth in the second half of following a first half year over year decline of 
our primary focus in was on revenue and gross profit growth 
in  we will work to increase productivity and reduce our indirect expenses and rationalize and leverage our general and administrative expenses in order to achieve positive cash flow 
however  at this time  we do not expect to generate net income during seasonality demand for our staffing services historically has been lower during the first and fourth quarters as a result of fewer business days and the fall off of the number of temporary professionals willing to work during the holidays 
demand for our staffing services usually increases in the second and third quarters of the year 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables based on our analysis of specific accounts and historical collection experiences applied to the remaining general accounts 
for specific accounts  we use our judgment  based on available facts and circumstances  to record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
for the remaining general accounts  a general reserve is established based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could change by a material amount 
accrued workers compensation 
we are partially self insured for our workers compensation liability 
the workers compensation program covers all of our temporary professionals and regular employees 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
to ensure that the accrued workers compensation balance is adequate to cover all costs incurred under our workers compensation program  at the end of each fiscal quarter  an actuarial report is prepared by an independent third party who calculates our self insurance claim liability based on historical experience and trends of industry data 
if historical experiences and industry trends change  the self insurance claim liability calculated by the third party actuary could change by a material amount 
as of december   the company has three separate unused letters of credit totaling  to secure our obligations for workers compensation claims under three insurance carriers 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies  such as legal and workers compensation matters  requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  results of operations may be over or understated 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets in accordance with sfas tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 
during the quarter and year ended december   the company recorded a non cash charge of  to establish a valuation allowance against its net domestic deferred income tax assets 
the valuation allowance has been calculated pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
such evidence includes a company s past and projected future performance  the market environment in which the company operates  the utilization of past tax credits and the length of carryback and carryforward periods 
in determining that a valuation allowance is required  the company placed added weight on the operating results of the past two years and the projected operating losses for the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence  as contemplated in sfas no 
 exists to support its reversal 
the company does not expect to recognize any domestic income tax benefits in future periods  until an appropriate level of profitability is reached 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
pursuant to fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis  rather than amortize them 
we may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  fas no 
requires us to allocate goodwill to our various business units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value of the businesses 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business unit 
this requires the identification of any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
when this process is completed  the amount of goodwill impairment is determined 
in addition  fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in testing for potential impairment under fas no 
 if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows  we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment  if any 
as part of our annual planning process in the fall of  we analyzed the long term growth expectations for our various reporting units  as well as our operating expenses  given ongoing implementation of our revitalization plan  approved in february we concluded that different growth expectations and higher operating costs  particularly related to our nurse travel and mf a reporting units  were events that could result in asset impairment 
as a result  we performed an impairment analysis of identifiable intangible assets with definite lives pursuant to fas no 
and an impairment analysis of goodwill pursuant to fas no 
with respect to our goodwill impairment testing  the fair market value of our reporting units was estimated by applying a traditional present value technique  utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
with respect to our identifiable intangible asset impairment testing  the fair market value of our customer relations was estimated by applying a traditional present value technique  utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows with adjustments for customer attrition and contributory asset charges 
the fair value of our contractor relations was developed using an estimated cost approach 
judgments and assumptions about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets  the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
although we believe the judgments and assumptions used in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate  there is nonetheless a high degree of uncertainty and judgment involved 
based on our fas no 
impairment analysis  we concluded that the carrying values of our customer relations and a component of our contractor relations were higher than their respective estimated fair values and  therefore  were impaired 
in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  of which  related to customer relations and  related to contractor relations 
in addition  based on our fas no 
impairment analysis  we concluded that  of recorded goodwill was impaired   related to our nurse travel unit and  related to our mf a unit 
the impairment charges related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with definite lives were expensed as a non cash charge to continuing operations during the quarter ended september  at december   we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill 
results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of intangibles impairment of goodwill operating income loss interest income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and revenues 
revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  lab support segment revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment  partially offset by a percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by reduced demand for our temporary professionals and intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller  privately held organizations 
our conversion and direct hire fee revenues were higher as more temporary professionals were converted into or hired directly as permanent employees 
decreased lab support segment revenues were partially offset by a percent increase in average billing rates during the year ended december  healthcare staffing segment revenues decreased by  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  nurse travel revenues were up  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was due  in part  to a percent increase in nurses on assignment  as well as an increase of  in revenues derived from hospitals that experienced strikes 
this increase was offset by a percent decrease in average hours worked per nurse 
mf a revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment  partially offset by an percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues were negatively impacted by restructuring efforts in  which included headcount reductions and branch office closures 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin  while gross margin decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lab support segment gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin for the segment decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in temporary professionals compensation  payroll taxes and employer paid benefits  as well as an increase in workers compensation 
this decrease in gross margin is partially offset by an increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues  which have no associated cost of services 
healthcare staffing segment gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin for the segment decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in this segment is gross profit from the nurse travel and mf a lines of business  and the decrease in gross margin was due  in part  to a change in the segment s product mix  as nurse travel revenues increased as a percentage of segment revenues by percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  to  respectively 
historically  nurse travel carries significantly lower margins than the mf a lines of business 
nurse travel gross margin increased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in workers compensation and billable expenses  partially offset by an increase in travel and housing expenses 
mf a gross margin decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for lab support and mf a lines of business  including staffing consultants compensation  rent  other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals 
nurse travel selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation for regional sales directors  account managers and recruiters  as well as rent  other office expenses and advertising for traveling temporary professionals 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include our corporate and support office expenses  such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel  recruiting and training expenses for field staff  marketing staff expenses  rent  expenses related to being a publicly traded company and other general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase of  in field operating expenses and a  increase in corporate expenses 
the increase in field operating expenses is primarily the result of increased staffing consultant salaries  commissions and bonuses in the period versus the period  due to higher headcount approved under our revitalization plan  as well as increased marketing expenses 
corporate expenses increased as a result of higher consulting costs in the period compared to related to information technology projects  recruiting and sarbanes oxley section compliance 
additionally  corporate payroll and related expenses increased due to higher headcount at the corporate offices 
corporate expenses also increased due to write offs of assets and internally developed software and increased expenses related to telecommunications  business insurance and miscellaneous office expenses 
the increase in corporate expenses was offset by lower expenses related to depreciation and amortization  bad debts and reduced spending related to travel and entertainment and incentive compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses included a charge of approximately  in the period for a reduction in personnel and branch office closures versus a net charge of  in the period 
the charge for the period includes an accrual for  related to severance costs for reorganization of senior management   for a retirement package inclusive of legal fees of  partially offset by a net benefit of  related to adjustments for branch office re openings and closures 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from percent in the period to percent in the period  primarily due to higher operating expenses  noted above  and lower revenues in the period 
impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as part of the company s annual planning process in the fall of  the company analyzed the long term growth expectations for its various reporting units  as well as its operating expenses  given ongoing implementation of the company s revitalization plan approved in february the company concluded that different growth expectations and higher operating costs  particularly related to the company s nurse travel and mf a reporting units  were events that could result in asset impairment 
as a result  the company performed an impairment analysis of identified intangibles with definite lives pursuant to fas no 
and an impairment analysis of goodwill pursuant to fas no 
in the first step  the company concluded that the carrying amount of the nurse travel asset group was not recoverable as it exceeded the asset group s expected undiscounted cash flows 
the company determined the fair value of its customer relations by applying a traditional present value technique  utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows with adjustments for customer attrition and contributory asset charges 
the fair value of the company s contractor relations was developed using an estimated cost approach 
based on this analysis  the company concluded that the carrying values of its customer relations and a component of its contractor relations were higher than the respective estimated fair values and  therefore  were impaired 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of  of which  related to customer relations and  related to contractor relations 
the company determined no additional impairment of identifiable intangible assets was warranted as of december  as part of the analysis of goodwill impairment  the company applied a traditional present value technique utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows and determined that the fair value of the nurse travel and mf a reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
the company then prepared a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill as of september  based on its impairment analysis  the company concluded that  of recorded goodwill was impaired   related to its nurse travel unit and  related to its mf a unit 
the impairment charges related to goodwill and other identifiable intangibles with definite lives have been expensed as a non cash charge to continuing operations during the quarter ended september  at december   we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill 
for the year ended december   a goodwill impairment charge of  was recorded  as discussed in our annual report and on form k  versus the charge of  recorded in the period  noted above 
interest income 
interest income remained relatively flat for the year  increasing from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes increased from a benefit of  for the year ended december   to a benefit of  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the difference in our tax rate for the year ended december   as compared with the corresponding period of  was primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill impairment of  recognized in the period as compared to  recognized in the period  and a valuation allowance booked against the deferred tax assets of the company in the period 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate would have been percent for this represents an increase from the percent in primarily due to benefits for higher income tax rates in nol carryback years  benefits associated with state income taxes and certain other permanent adjustments 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues decreased  or percent from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  lab support segment s revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a percent decrease in conversion fee revenue from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by reduced client demand for our temporary professionals  particularly in the biotechnology sector  due to a slow down in research and development and quality control spending caused by the weak economy 
in addition  we experienced intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller  privately held organizations 
our conversion fee revenue was lower as fewer temporary professionals were converted into permanent employees  primarily due to the weak economy and increased competition 
decreased lab support segment revenues were partially offset by a percent increase in average billing rates during the year ended december  due to an increase in bill rates and favorable exchange rates 
healthcare staffing segment s revenues decreased by  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  nurse travel revenues were down  or percent  from  for the period april   the date of the hpo acquisition  through december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due  in part  to a percent decrease in nurses on assignment  as well as a decrease of  in revenues from hospitals that experienced strikes 
in addition  we were negatively impacted by a shift to all inclusive billing from the direct billing of reimbursable travel and housing expenses without a corresponding increase in average bill rates 
this was offset by a percent increase in the number of billable days from  the year of the hpo acquisition  to mf a revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a percent decrease in conversion fee revenue from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by lower client demand for our temporary professionals due to weak economic conditions  increased competition  high turnover and loss of market share 
our conversion fee revenue was lower as fewer temporary professionals were converted into permanent employees  primarily due to the weak economy and increased competition 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lab support segment gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin for the segment decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to a percent increase in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes  partially offset by a percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a percent decrease in workers compensation expense 
healthcare staffing segment gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin for the segment decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively

nurse travel gross margin decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes  as well as an increase in workers compensation expense  partially offset by a decrease in travel and housing expenses 
mf a gross margin decreased percent from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively

selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to the hpo acquisition were  for the period april  through december  and  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from percent for the period to percent in the period primarily due to higher fixed operating expenses relative to revenues and costs associated with our headcount reductions and branch office closures 
impairment of goodwill 
based on our impairment analysis at june   we concluded that goodwill  related to one of our reporting units in the healthcare staffing segment  was impaired 
as required by fas no 
 in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment  we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill of the reporting unit 
based on this allocation  we concluded that  of recorded goodwill was impaired 
the goodwill impairment has been expensed as a non cash charge to continuing operations during the second quarter of at december   we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill 
interest income 
interest income  net  decreased percent from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rates and lower average balances in our interest bearing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities account balances due primarily to cash used in the april hpo acquisition 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes decreased from  for the year ended december   to a benefit of  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the difference in our tax rate for the year ended december   as compared with the corresponding period of was primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill impairment recognized in the period 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment  the effective tax rate would have been percent for this represents a decrease from percent in primarily due to the permanent non deductible differences  the effect of international operations and an adjustment to our state tax receivable balance 
liquidity and capital resources our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our working capital at december  was  including  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable and related payroll expenses 
although we do not have a borrowing facility in place  we believe we have the ability to enter into a borrowing facility based on market conditions at december  historically  we have relied on cash flows from operations as our primary source of liquidity  and we are subject to the risk that a decrease in demand for our staffing services could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by  during the year ended december  this resulted from cash used for operations of  cash provided by investing activities of  and cash provided from financing activities of  in addition  foreign exchange rate changes had a positive effect of  on cash and cash equivalents 
cash used for operations of  is comprised of the net loss of  adjusted for non cash charges of  and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of  non cash charges consisted of the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill of  depreciation and amortization of  the change in deferred taxes of  the provision for doubtful accounts  fixed asset disposals and other non cash charges 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities consisted principally of an increase in income taxes receivable of  related to the carryback of federal net operating losses and an increase in gross accounts receivable and other assets of  primarily related to an increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of these amounts were offset by an increase in accounts payable and all other liabilities of  a decrease in prepaid expenses of  and an increase in income taxes payable of  having substantially completed the planned expansion of our field operations team  we do not expect branch operating and corporate expenses to increase significantly in we expect growth of our businesses may result in increased working capital needs in order to finance increases in accounts receivable and payroll related expenses 
cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of the proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of  offset by capital expenditures of  related primarily to information technology projects as well as leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases 
we expect cash flow to continue to benefit from a return to lower levels of capital expenditures of approximately  for the year ending december  cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   which consisted of the proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of common stock options 
the company reclassified investments in auction rate securities that were previously classified as cash equivalents in the accompanying and balance sheets to marketable securities 
the and statements of cash flows were adjusted to reflect the impact of the reclassification also discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
on june   the board of directors authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to  shares of on assignment inc s common stock 
during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock on the open market

commitments and contingencies we have completed our initial implementation of a peoplesoft enterprise wide information technology system 
we incurred approximately  and  in capital expenditures related to this project during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to incur an additional  to  in capital expenditures in related to peoplesoft and approximately  related to other information technology projects  leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases 
we lease space for our corporate and branch offices 
the lease agreement related to our corporate office in calabasas  ca as amended in is for a seven year extension of the existing lease term from march to march we have committed to base rental payments totaling  over the term of the agreement with the last monthly payment due on march  rent expense net of sublease income for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth  on an aggregate basis  at december   the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown in thousands  net of sublease income contractual obligations thereafter total operating lease obligations for additional information about these contractual cash obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
however  based on the facts currently available  we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we are partially self insured for workers compensation expense 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported 
we account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on actuarial reports prepared by an independent third party who reviews historical experience and current trends of industry data 
changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made 
the net self insurance claim liability amounted to approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had three separate unused letters of credit totaling  to secure our obligations for worker s compensation claims under three insurance carriers 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
under the retroactive alternatives  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in december  the fasb also issued fasb staff position sfas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of this statement provides entities more time to evaluate the impact of the american jobs creation act of on the entity s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fasb staff position sfas was effective upon issuance 
the company is currently evaluating the effect this new act might have on its foreign reinvestment plans as well as on its worldwide tax position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
our interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of the majority of our investments 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into us dollars 
based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements 
we do not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under fas no
