item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rcm participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and extremely sensitive to economic changes 
as a result  the impact of economic changes on revenues and operations can be volatile 
the company s consolidated revenues have declined or million from a peak of million in the year ended october  during the latter portion of the s rcm made significant personnel and infrastructure investments to support a high growth strategy through broad based market penetration and acquisitions 
the dramatic slowdown in the united states economy  which began during  prompted management to reconsider its strategy 
in that regard  the company initiated reductions in its staff personnel and office requirements in response to the decrease in sales volume in the year since that time  management has continued to monitor its operating cost structure in order to maintain a cost benefit relationship with revenues 
in addition  there has been an ongoing focus on working capital management and cash flows 
these efforts have resulted in an improvement in accounts receivable collections  debt reduction and improved cash flows 
furthermore  the company has improved discipline in its marketing and sales strategies by providing a more cohesive and relevant marketing and sales approach to new and existing customers and now focuses on growth in targeted vertical markets and in service offerings providing greater revenue opportunities 
the company believes that most companies have recognized the importance of the internet and information management technologies to compete in today s business climate 
however  the uncertain economic environment has curtailed many companies motivation for rapid adoption of many technological enhancements 
the process of designing  developing and implementing software solutions has become increasingly complex 
the company believes that many companies today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing the initiatives they undertake 
this has had the effect of delaying or totally negating spending on many emerging new solutions  which management formerly had anticipated 
nonetheless  the company continues to believe that it managers must integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms  operating systems  databases and networking protocols  and must implement packaged software applications to support existing business objectives 
companies also need to continually keep pace with new developments  which often render existing equipment and internal skills obsolete 
consequently  business drivers cause it managers to support increasingly complex systems and applications of significant strategic value  while working under budgetary  personnel and expertise constraints 
this has given rise to a demand for outsourcing 
the company believes that its current clients and prospective future clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical applications and entire business functions 
the company provides project management and consulting services which are billed based on either an agreed upon fixed fee or hourly rates  or a combination of both 
the billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are higher than those for professional consulting services 
the company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services 
the company also realizes revenues from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end to end solutions 
these services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the company s consultants based upon their skill level  experience and the type of work performed 
the majority of the company s services are provided under purchase orders 
contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary 
although contracts normally relate to longer term and more complex engagements  they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on to days notice 
revenues are recognized when services are provided 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued costs of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation related expenses for billable consultants  including payroll taxes  employee benefits and insurance 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development  recruiting  operating activities and training  and include corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities  including the company s corporate marketing  administrative and reporting responsibilities and acquisition program 
the company records these expenses when incurred 
depreciation relates primarily to the fixed assets of the company 
amortization relates to a covenant not to compete resulting from one of the company s acquisitions 
acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for financial reporting purposes and have created goodwill 
critical accounting policies the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make subjective decisions  assessments  and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgments increases  such judgments become even more subjective 
while management believes that its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate  actual results may be materially different than estimated 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies  described below  that require significant judgment to be exercised by management 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from several sources 
all of the company s segments perform staffing services 
the company s professional engineering services and information technology services segments also perform project services 
the information technology services segment also derives revenue from permanent placement fees 
project services the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  staff accounting bulletin sab number  revenue recognition 
sab clarifies application of us generally accepted accounting principles to revenue transactions 
project services are generally provided on a cost plus fixed fee or time and material basis 
typically  a customer will outsource a discrete project or activity and the company assumes responsibility for the performance of such project or activity 
the company recognizes revenues and associated costs on a gross basis as services are provided to the customer and costs are incurred using its employees 
the company  from time to time  enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables 
the company recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables 
in instances where project services are provided on a fixed price basis and the contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract 
in some instances  revenue is billed and recorded at the time certain milestones are reached  as defined in the contract 
in other instances  revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour 
in addition  some contracts contain performance fees bonuses for completing a contract under budget 
performance fees  if any  are recorded when the contract is completed and the revenue is reasonably certain of collection 
some contracts also limit revenues and billings to maximum amounts 
provision for contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
expenses related to contracts that extend beyond a month period are charged to cost of services as incurred 
staffing services revenues derived from staffing services are recorded on a gross basis as services are performed and associated costs have been incurred using employees of the company 
in these circumstances  the company assumes the risk of acceptability of its employees to its customers 
in certain cases  the company may utilize other companies and their employees to fulfill customer requirements 
in these cases  the company receives an administrative fee for arranging for  billing for and collecting the billings related to these companies 
the customer is typically responsible for assessing the work of these companies who have responsibility for acceptability of their personnel to the customer 
under these circumstances  the company s reported revenues are net of associated costs effectively the administrative fee 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition continued permanent placement services the company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services 
fees for placements are recognized at the time the candidate commences employment 
the company guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for days 
in the event a candidate is not retained for the day period  the company will provide a suitable replacement candidate 
in the event a replacement candidate cannot be located  the company will provide a prorated refund to the client 
an allowance for refunds  based upon the company s historical experience  is recorded in the financial statements 
revenues are recorded on a gross basis as a component of revenue 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers 
credit is extended based on evaluation of customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and intangibles the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  the company evaluates the carrying value and recoverability of its goodwill by evaluating the fair market value of the reporting units within which goodwill resides 
the process of estimating fair value  in part  relies on the use of forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected from a reporting unit as well as the use of market multiples in determining fair market value 
in order to estimate future cash flows  management must make subjective judgments based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
the periods for estimating future cash flows are uncertain  which increases the risk that actual future results could significantly deviate from estimates 
changes in future market conditions  the company s strategy  or other factors could have an effect upon the future values of these reporting units  which could result in future impairment charges 
accounting for stock options the company has used stock options to attract  retain and reward employees for long term service 
generally accepted accounting principles allow alternative methods of accounting for these awards 
the company has chosen to account for its stock plans including stock option plans under accounting principle board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
since option exercise prices reflect the market value per share of the company s stock upon grant  no compensation expense related to stock options is reflected in the company s income statement 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prescribes the alternative method of accounting for stock options 
had sfas been adopted  the company would have recorded additional pre tax costs of approximately   and  for the years ended january   december  and december   respectively 
the pro forma compensation cost was calculated using the black scholes options pricing model  which includes estimates based on assumptions for the risk free interest rate  life of options and stock price volatility and is based upon freely traded options 
changes in the underlying assumptions could affect the pro forma compensation cost 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounting for stock options continued in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for employee stock options 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for shared based compensation transactions using apb and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r also requires that tax benefits associated with these share based payments be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flow rather than operating activities as currently permitted 
sfas no 
r becomes effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  the company is required to apply sfas no 
r beginning fiscal quarter ended october  sfas no 
r offers alternative methods of adopting this final rule 
at the present time  the company has not yet determined which alternative method it will use 
accounting for income taxes in establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws  published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings 
as of january   the company had total net deferred tax assets of million 
this included million relating to federal and state net operating loss carry forwards and million for a reserve for litigation charges 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time  and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments  additional valuation allowances may be required 
forward looking information the company s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends 
the pace of customer capital spending programs  new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for consulting and engineering services as well as temporary and permanent employees 
should the us economy decline  the company s operating performance could be adversely impacted 
the company believes that its fiscal discipline  strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends 
however  further declines in the economy could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy 
additionally  changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits  licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce rcm s future earnings 
there can be no assurance that rcm will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing 
the employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry 
rcm competes in global  national  regional and local markets with numerous consulting  engineering and employment companies 
price competition in the industries the company serves is significant  and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing 
rcm expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future  which could limit rcm s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability
