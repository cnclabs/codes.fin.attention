the company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including and as discussed below those significant estimates related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and restructuring accruals 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company has identified the following policies as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these policies and the disclosures below with the audit committee of the board of directors 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue arises from two sources a the sale of licenses to use our software products  and b the delivery of customer support  outsourcing  hosting  implementation  consulting  training and education services related to our software products 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex  often subject to interpretation  and continue to evolve 
very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue are followed by the company  however  certain judgments affect the application of the company s revenue policy 
on occasion  the company is unable to recognize software license revenue in the period an order is received due to the requirements of the applicable accounting standards  the judgments involved and contractual provisions in response to customer demands 
delays in the timing and amount of revenue recognition for software license fees have caused volatility in the company s financial results 
software license fee revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract  product delivery  a fixed or determinable license fee and probability of collection 
if the license fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  the total arrangement fee is allocated among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is 
table of contents allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements may consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  hosting and consulting services 
vsoe is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element  the total arrangement fee will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue from consulting and implementation services is  in general  time and material based and recognized as the work is performed 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
some professional consulting services involve fixed price and or fixed time arrangements and are recognized using contract accounting  which requires the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue for these projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method  with progress to completion measured by using specific milestones  usually labor unit inputs  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins on these projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
although the company has a good history of successful services performance  occasional deviations from the significant estimates required for larger services engagements  particularly those with fixed price arrangements could cause volatility in the company s financial results 
revenue from customer support services is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  typically one year 
revenue from outsourcing and hosting services is recognized based upon contractually agreed upon rates per user or service  over a contractually defined time period 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated accounts receivable losses resulting from the inability or failure of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is formula based  supplemented by an evaluation of specific accounts where there may be collectibility risk 
if the methodology the company uses to calculate this allowance does not properly reflect future collections  revenue could be overstated or understated 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based upon historical collections and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balance s  evaluation of the account s financial condition  recent payment history  and discussions with the company s account executive for the specific customer 
based upon this evaluation of collectibility  any increase or decrease required in the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of march  and  as of march  the decrease is attributable to improvements in the aging and collections of outstanding accounts receivable during the year ended march  the company generates a significant portion of revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the utility industry 
as of march   approximately million  or  of the company s gross accounts receivable were attributable to software license fees and services sales to utility customers 
in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  the company has considered the financial condition of the utility industry as a whole  as well as the financial condition of individual utility customers 
revenue from sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar resulted in approximately million of the company s march  gross accounts receivable  of which approximately million were denominated in euros 
historically  the foreign currency gains and losses on these receivables have not 
table of contents been significant  and the company has determined that foreign currency derivative products are not required to hedge the company s exposure 
if the value of the us dollar significantly increased versus one or more foreign currencies  the us dollar equivalents received from the us dollar receivables could be significantly less than the march  reported amount 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill the acquisition of indus utility systems  inc ius  formerly sct utility systems  inc  in march and wishbone systems  inc 
wishbone in january resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as other definite lived intangible assets 
under present accounting rules sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  instead it is subject to impairment testing criteria 
other acquired definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing  the company considers itself to be a single reporting unit and assesses goodwill impairment on an enterprise wide level 
the impairment test is performed on a consolidated basis and compares the company s market capitalization reporting unit fair value to its outstanding equity reporting unit carrying value 
in accordance with the recommended provisions of sfas no 
 the company utilizes its closing stock price as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of the impairment test in order to compute market capitalization 
the company has designated december as the annual date for impairment testing 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed since the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
no events have occurred  nor circumstances changed subsequent to december   that would reduce the fair value of the company s reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of impairment 
the impairment review may require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about the company s operating performance 
if such a review indicates that the assets are impaired  an expense would be recorded for the amount of the impairment  and the corresponding impaired assets would be reduced in carrying value 
differences in the identification of reporting units and the use of valuation techniques can result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
restructuring in the year ended march   the company recorded net restructuring charges of million for revisions to accounting estimates from prior business restructurings and for additional restructuring charges related to office and business consolidations and employee severance 
revisions to the company s assumptions for expected sublease income from two unoccupied floors in san francisco  ca comprised million of this expense 
further consolidation of office space in san francisco and atlanta  ga resulted in million in new restructuring charges for the year 
this consolidation included vacating three floors in atlanta and one additional floor in san francisco 
the remaining million in restructuring expense is associated with the elimination of approximately positions  including the transfer of certain functions to the company owned office buildings in columbia  sc and the outsourcing of some development functions to india 
at march   a total of million remains in the current and long term restructuring accruals for these initiatives and relates to employee severance and excess lease costs associated with subleasing the company s vacated office space in atlanta and san francisco 
these restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits 
between january  and march   the company recorded restructuring charges totaling million relating to two restructuring initiatives the relocation of the company s headquarters from san francisco to atlanta and the suspension of the united kingdom ministry of defense mod project 
at march   a total of million remains in the current and long term restructuring accruals 
table of contents for these initiatives  all of which relates to excess lease costs associated with subleasing the company s vacated office space in san francisco  dallas  tx and pittsburgh  pa 
should rental conditions in the company s atlanta location deteriorate to the point where the remaining redundant office space is not leased  the company could incur additional charges totaling approximately million through should rental conditions improve  it is possible that higher than anticipated sublease income could be generated 
any increases or decreases in the restructuring accruals arising from changes in estimates will be reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary 
the restructuring accruals remaining as of march  are included in the consolidated financial statements in accrued liabilities for amounts due within one year and other liabilities for amounts due after one year

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt statement r during its first quarter of fiscal statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior periods of the year of adoption 
the company has not yet determined which method it will adopt 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation expense cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
however  in the case of the company  the existence of its net operating loss carryforward will preclude recognition of the tax benefit until the deduction can be used to offset current taxes payable 
the company cannot estimate what the tax amounts will be in the future or when they will be recognized  because they depend on  among other things  when the net operating loss carryforwards will expire and when employees exercise stock options
