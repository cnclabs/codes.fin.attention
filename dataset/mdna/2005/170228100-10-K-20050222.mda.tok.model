item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december    and the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and selected statistical information included in this report 
application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be the most critical in their potential effect on its financial position or results of operations allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge against current earnings to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
there are three components of the allowance for loan losses specific reserves for loans considered to be impaired or for other loans for which management considers a specific reserve to be necessary  allocated reserves based upon management s formula based process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and a non specific environmentally driven allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of other qualitative factors 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly reviewed by the company for adequacy using a consistent  systematic methodology which assesses such factors as changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in portfolio credit quality  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
adverse changes in management s assessment of these factors could lead to additional provisions for loan losses 
the company s methodology with respect to the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is more fully discussed in later sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 

table of contents goodwill impairment 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  effective january  the statement addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eliminates further amortization of goodwill  and requires periodic impairment evaluations of goodwill 
impairment evaluations are required to be performed annually and may be required more frequently if certain conditions indicating potential impairment exist 
in the event that the company determined that its goodwill was impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on its results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on its financial position 
mortgage servicing rights msrs 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through the sale of financial assets on a servicing retained basis 
capitalized servicing rights are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated regularly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying servicing rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates  original loan terms and whether the loans are fixed or adjustable rate mortgages 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
when the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value  an impairment reserve is recognized so that each individual stratum is carried at the lower of its amortized book value or fair value 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
income taxes 
the company estimates its income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates to determine an appropriate expense against current pre tax earnings 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as timing of the deduction of expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   there were no valuation allowances set aside against any deferred tax assets 
interest income recognition 
interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is not accrued on loans days or more past due unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection or on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
all loans considered impaired are nonaccruing 
interest on nonaccruing loans is recognized as payments are received when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued is reversed against current period interest income  therefore an increase in loans on nonaccural status could have an adverse impact on interest income recognized in future periods 
restructuring charges 
the company recognizes restructuring charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges  which contain specific guidance regarding the types of  and circumstances under which  certain expenses can be accrued 
in general  the statements require that the company have a detailed plan in place  which has been communicated to substantially all the employees affected in the staff reduction  branch closures sales  or computer conversions 
significant management judgment is required in estimating the amount of expense that is appropriate to recognize in relation to these plans

table of contents nonperforming assets loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
management classifies loans as nonaccrual when they become days past due as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
in addition  loans that have not met this delinquency test may be placed on nonaccrual at management s discretion 
to the extent that certain loans classified as nonaccrual have an associated governmental agency guarantee  a separate assessment of the classification of the guaranteed portion is made 
generally  as long as interest and principal are less than days past due  the guaranteed amounts are collectible from the guarantor and therefore are not classified as nonaccrual 
in these situations  only the non guaranteed portion of the loan would be classified as nonaccrual 
in the event that a guaranteed loan was to exceed days past due  no further interest would be accrued on the guaranteed portion  as it generally would not be reimbursed by the guarantor 
consumer and residential loans are included when management considers it to be appropriate  based upon evidence of collectibility  the value of any underlying collateral and other general criteria 
generally  a loan remains on nonaccrual status until the factors which indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when its interest rate is reduced and or other terms are modified because of the inability of the borrower to service debt at current market rates and terms

nonaccrual loans at december  consisted of approximately loans  which were diversified across a range of industries  sectors and geography 
nonaccrual loans with payments less than days past due represent of total loans on nonaccrual at december  allowance for loan losses adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  which analyzes the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
in addition to evaluating the collectibility of specific loans when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management also takes into consideration other factors such as changes in the mix and size of the loan portfolio  historic loss experience  the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified  and economic trends 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific loss allocations are made against certain adversely classified loans  and general loss allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio which have similar attributes 
the company s historical loss experience  industry trends  and the impact of the local and regional economy on the company s borrowers  were considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against current earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
while management uses available information to assess possible losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in non performing loans  changes in economic conditions  growth in loan portfolios  or for other reasons 
any future additions to the allowance would be recognized in the period in which they were determined to be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require the company to record additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 
credit quality of the commercial portfolios is quantified by a corporate credit rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk 
individual loan officers monitor their loans to ensure 
table of contents appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis 
risk ratings and quality of commercial and consumer credit portfolios are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent credit review department 
credit review personnel conduct ongoing portfolio trend analyses and individual credit reviews to evaluate loan risk and compliance with corporate lending policies 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
consumer and residential real estate loan quality is evaluated on the basis of delinquency data and other credit data available due to the large number of such loans and the relatively small size of individual credits 
allocations for these loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses 
in each category  inherent losses are estimated based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
in addition  certain loans in these categories may be individually risk rated if considered necessary by management 
the other method used to allocate the allowance for loan losses entails the assignment of reserve amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the company will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based on internal risk ratings or non accrual status 
a specific reserve amount is allocated to an individual loan when that loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimable on the basis of its collateral value  the present value of anticipated future cash flows  or its net realizable value 
at december   impaired loans with specific reserves totaled  all of these loans were on nonaccrual status and the amount of such reserves were

lower levels of gains on sales of securities and mortgage loans  net of lower losses on prepayments of borrowings  accounted for the majority of the variance 
excluding these items  noninterest income was million higher in than in  driven primarily by higher levels of investment management income  which offset lower levels of retail investment income 
also included in the other income amount was million in gains on sales of two branches 

table of contents in  noninterest expenses were million lower than in  primarily driven by million in reduced conversion and restructuring charges 
an additional million was due to reduced salary expenses  driven by lower staffing and reduced levels of incentive compensation 
lower levels of data processing expenses also accounted for million of the decline 
increased employee benefits costs  driven by higher medical and dental benefits of  were offset by reduced levels of occupancy expenses of  and other noninterest expenses of million 
the components of other noninterest expense for the years presented are as follows in thousands legal and professional marketing software and supplies net oreo and collection expenses telephone postage other income taxes the company and the banks are taxed on income by the irs at the federal level and by various states in which they do business 
the state of vermont levies franchise taxes on banking institutions based upon average deposit levels in lieu of taxing income 
franchise taxes are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
income tax provision for the years ended december  and  federal and state income tax provisions amounted to million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the respective periods were and 
during both periods  the company s statutory federal corporate tax rate was 
the company s effective tax rates differed from the statutory rates primarily because of state income taxes paid  net of benefit on federal taxes  and the proportion of interest income from state and municipal securities and loans which are partially exempt from federal taxation  and tax credits on investments in qualified low income housing projects 
the company invests in these partnerships primarily as a means of managing its effective tax rate and targets its investments in communities where they qualify for inclusion as cra eligible investments 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net interest income for  net interest income was million  compared with million for on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased million from to million in these increases resulted from higher levels of interest earning assets  which were up billion from  to billion for the increased levels of average earning assets were primarily due to the acquisition of granite bank in the first quarter of the increased level of earning assets offset a decrease in the net yield on earning assets from in  to in 
table of contents noninterest income and noninterest expense noninterest income was million in  up million from the million reported in the increase was primarily due to higher gains on the sale of mortgage loans and securities  improved mortgage servicing income and higher fee income due to the granite bank acquisition 
noninterest expense totaled million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the primary factors in this increase in noninterest expense were the acquisition of granite bank  higher commissions and sales based incentive expenses  and the conversion and restructuring charges

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
since the company has no trading operations  risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices are not significant 
interest rate risk  including mortgage prepayment risk  is the single most significant non credit risk to which the company is exposed 
to measure the sensitivity of its income to changes in interest rates  the company uses a variety of methods  including simulation  and gap analyses 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board of directors  which reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying exposures  quantifying them and taking appropriate actions 
the company uses simulation analyses to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a relatively short ie  within one year time horizon 
simulation analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario 
these assumptions are the basis for projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets and liabilities under various scenarios 
simulation analysis may have certain limitations caused by market conditions varying from those assumed in a model 
actual results can often differ due to the effects of prepayments and refinancings of loans and investments  as well as the repricing or runoff of deposits  which may be different from that which has been assumed 

table of contents the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately  up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the next twelve months should neither improve or be impacted by greater than 
an additional analysis is performed to review results if interest rates were to shift quarterly  ramped up or down and basis points over a twelve month period 
the results of these simulations are shown below interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  in thousands immediate ramped net interest income net income net interest income net income changes in interest rates changes in interest rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps policy limit policy limit the basis point shock down scenario has a remote probability of occurring  therefore the results are only for informational purposes 
as noted above  one of the tools used to measure rate sensitivity is the funds gap 
the funds gap is defined as the amount by which a bank s rate sensitive assets exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
this indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period 
this mismatch will improve earnings in a rising rate environment and inhibit earnings when rates decline 
conversely  when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the gap is referred to as negative and indicates that a greater volume of liabilities than assets will reprice during the period 
in this case  a rising rate environment will inhibit earnings and declining rates will improve earnings 
notwithstanding this general description of the effect on income of the gap position  it may not be an accurate predictor of changes in net interest income 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
at december   the estimated exposure was and the company was asset sensitive
