overview was a year of significant growth for us 
during the year we acquired five apartment communities that increased our apartment holdings by  completed two equity offerings in which we raised approximately million  and consummated seven financing and four refinancing transactions for various apartment properties 
as a result of these activities  we saw significant increases in revenue  expenses  debt and equity 
for the year  total revenue increased by million over this increase was attributable to an million increase in apartment rental income in while the majority of the increase in apartment rental income million was the result of five apartment acquisitions in and two apartment acquisitions in  significant improvement in apartment occupancy and rental rates in made a meaningful contribution million to the increase 
on a same units basis for the  units that we owned throughout and  apartment rental income increased by 
average economic occupancy for these units was in as compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied unit was in as compared to in the increase in apartment rental revenue was partially offset by a million decline in restaurant rental income due to the sale of two restaurant properties in this decline from the sale of the two restaurant properties actually masked continued improvement in food sales at our restaurant properties 
in an attempt to reverse years of declining sales  hardee s  the concept at of our restaurant properties  introduced the thick burger product line in almost immediately we began to see significant sales increases with same store sales at our restaurant properties increasing by in these increases continued into with same store sales for improving by over levels 
the rent we receive from the restaurants is the greater of percentage rent of annual food sales or a set minimum rent currently million per annum 
we received the minimum rent in for us to receive percentage rent in  same store sales would have to increase by 
given the current state of flux in the fast food industry  we are uncomfortable making a prediction or relying on the forecasts of others as to future sales trends for hardee s 
for this reason  we have based our plans and expectations on continuing to receive the minimum rent in the growth in the size of our apartment portfolio led to significant growth in total expenses with large increases in apartment operations  apartment administration  interest expense  and depreciation 
interestingly  on a same units basis  apartment operating expense for increased by only 
it is also interesting to note that as a percentage of apartment rental income  apartment operating expense decreased from in to in the positive impact of the new apartment communities and improving apartment operations were reflected in positive corporate operating results 
net income after the minority interest in the operating partnership net income or loss  and before deduction for cumulative preferred dividend increased to  in from  in  while funds from operations in increased by compared to after several difficult years  we began to see significant improvement in our apartment operations in mid this improvement continued throughout with improving occupancies and improving rental rates 
with economic occupancy for all apartments for averaging it will be difficult for us to make significant gains in occupancy going forward  therefore our emphasis will turn to increasing rental rates 
while we have some concerns  we are confident that we are in good position to enjoy continued improvement in our apartment operations 
this confidence is based on a number of factors o most important among these is our emphasis on middle market apartments 
we believe there is an increasing need for high quality  modestly priced apartments that are well located  extremely well maintained and professionally managed 
at an average base rental rate of slightly more than per month  we provide high quality housing for firefighters  policemen  teachers  office workers  store clerks  young couples and an increasing number or retirees 
our combination of affordability with quality gives us a wide group of potential residents 
o our properties are in good markets with excellent locations within those markets 
we operate in virginia  north carolina and south carolina 
while  like much of the country  they have displayed some weakness over the past few years  we are quite positive about the long term economic and demographic outlook for these states and the markets within them in which we operate 
o our properties are in very good physical condition 
an essential part of our strategy is the maintenance of our properties 
we do not develop new properties  but believe we can deliver a higher quality product at a more reasonable price by maintaining existing apartment properties 
maintenance is very important to us  not only because we believe it is essential to preserving and enhancing the value of our investment  but also because we believe it is essential to our marketing efforts to attract residents 
as a result  our properties are in very good physical condition 
o we are well positioned to compete on price with single family homes and new apartment construction 
our two biggest sources of competition for residents are single family homes and new apartment construction 
the advent of no down payment single family home mortgages combined with historic low interest rates has posed a challenge for us for the past few years 
however  significant increases in construction costs and rising home mortgage rates appear to be resolving this issue 
the same is true for new apartment construction  as rising construction costs are making it more difficult to build new apartments of similar size  quality and location as ours that can be profitably rented in the per month range 
all in all  we are optimistic about the long term outlook for both our apartment markets and our apartment operations 
we do  however  expect early to continue to be somewhat weak  with an expectation that apartment performance will strengthen as the year progresses 
one area of concern is interest rates 
as we enter  we have million of debt 
while we have attempted to mitigate interest rate risk somewhat by having approximately of this amount be at fixed rates  the balance carries a floating rate 
based on the amounts in place at year end a rise in average annual rates for the full year would increase our interest expense by approximately  in theory  rising interest rates correlate with improving apartment operating fundamentals  but whether this will in fact be the case or whether it will match in timing and amount remains to be seen 
we intend to monitor the situation and may adjust the amount of debt or the allocation of debt between fixed and variable rates as the year progresses 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are identified and discussed in the notes to our financial statements included in this annual report 
those policies that may be of particular interest to readers of this annual report are further discussed below 
capital expenditures and depreciation in general  for the apartment properties acquired before  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over composite estimated useful lives of the related assets  generally years for buildings  years for land improvements  years for fixtures and equipment  and five years for floor coverings 
for apartment properties acquired after  we performed detailed analyses of components of the real estate assets acquired 
for these properties  we assigned estimated useful lives as follows base building structure  years  land improvements  years  short lived building components  years  and fixtures  equipment and floor coverings  years 
we generally complete and capitalize acquisition improvements expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which are intended to position the property consistent with our physical standards within one to two years of acquisition of the related apartment property 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize recurring capital expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of existing assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we depreciate these additions and replacements on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of years 
we retire replaced assets with a charge to depreciation for any remaining carrying value 
we capitalize all floor covering  appliance  and hvac replacements  and depreciate them using a straight line  group method over estimated useful lives of years 
capital expenditures at our apartment communities during totaled million  including million for acquisition improvements  million for additions and betterments  million for reconstruction and replacement of casualty losses  and million in recurring capital expenditures 
we expense ordinary repairs and maintenance costs at apartment communities 
repairs and maintenance at our apartment communities during totaled million  including million in compensation of service staff and million in payments for materials and contracted services 
costs of repairs  maintenance  and capital replacements and improvements at restaurant properties are borne by the lessee 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review our real estate assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered from their undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if the carrying value were to be greater than the undiscounted future operating cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount is not recoverable 
our estimates of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties  including  among others  demand for apartment units  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the undiscounted future operating cash flows that we estimate in our impairment analyses may not be achieved  and it is possible that we could be required to recognize impairment losses on our properties at some point in the future 
valuation of leases in place at property acquisitions we calculate an estimate of the value of leases in place at the dates of property acquisitions to determine if we should allocate a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset for the value of these leases 
in preparing this calculation  we consider the estimated costs to make an apartment unit rent ready frequently called turnover costs  the estimated costs and lost income associated with executing a new lease on an apartment unit  and the remaining terms of leases in place  and we compare rental rates on leases in place to our estimate of prevailing market rates in the neighborhood of the acquired property 
based on our analyses for the seven apartment properties that we acquired in and  we determined that the net value of leases in place at the dates of acquisition was insignificant to the acquisition costs  and we did not record any intangible asset for leases in place 
this result is primarily due to the relatively short term nature of apartment leases  the regular pattern of turnover of apartment leases  and the relatively gradual movement of prevailing rental rates in the respective neighborhoods 
we plan to prepare similar calculations in conjunction with future property acquisitions 
revenue recognition we record rental and other income monthly as it is earned 
we record rental payments that we receive prior to the first of a given month as prepaid rent 
we hold tenant security deposits in trust in bank accounts separate from operating cash these amounts are included in other current assets on our balance sheet  and we record a corresponding liability for security deposits on our balance sheet 
we amortize any cash concessions given at the inception of an apartment lease over the approximate life of the lease  which is generally one year or less 
in general  cash concessions range from to and are taken by residents during the first two months of the lease 
results of operations compared to revenues revenues in totaled million  an increase of compared to apartment related income apartment rental income plus income from apartment management and investment activities accounted for of our total revenue in  compared to in apartment rental income in totaled million  an increase of  or million  compared to million of this increase is attributable to rental income at seven apartment communities that we acquired during and on a same units basis for the  units that we owned throughout all of both and  apartment rental income increased by million  or  compared to on a same units basis  average economic occupancy was in compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied unit was in compared to in in  for all apartment units  average economic occupancy was  and average revenue per occupied unit was restaurant rental income in totaled million  a decline of compared to the decrease in restaurant rental income is due to the sale of two restaurant properties in we received the minimum rent specified in the lease agreement throughout both years 
under our master lease with boddie noell enterprises  restaurant rental income payments are the greater of specific minimum rent or of food sales 
minimum rent is set at approximately  per month  or  per year  per restaurant property 
we currently hold restaurant properties under this lease  and minimum rent is currently set at  per month  or million per year 
same store sales for the restaurants that were open throughout all of both and increased by in compared to for the first time in almost nine years  during the second and third quarters of  sales at our restaurant properties exceeded the threshold for percentage rent  however  for the full month period  sales fell short of the threshold for rent exceeding the minimum rent 
management fee income in totaled million  a decline of compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to our acquisitions of two previously managed properties one in august  and one in july 
we expect that management fee income will further decline significantly in as a result of our anticipated acquisitions of managed properties 
during  we recorded casualty gains of  related to fires that occurred at two apartment communities in each case  one building incurred substantial damage 
we received insurance proceeds totaling  against which we identified and wrote off  net carrying value of assets destroyed 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to recognize this difference as a gain 
however  we intend to reinvest all of the insurance proceeds in replacement assets 
we are fully insured for the losses  including rent continuation insurance which covers of lost rental income 
expenses total expenses  including non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and write off of unamortized loan costs  totaled million in  an increase of compared to apartment operations expense includes only direct costs of on site operations 
this line item totaled million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is primarily attributable to operating expenses at seven apartment communities that we acquired during and on a same units basis  apartment operations expense increased by only in compared to  reflecting higher costs for compensation  offset by reductions in insurance  leasing and turnover costs 
as a percentage of apartment rental income  apartment operations expense decreased from in to in we incur no operating expenses for restaurant properties because the triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all costs and expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
apartment administration expense the costs associated with oversight  accounting  and support of our apartment management activities for both properties we own and properties we manage totaled million in  an increase of compared to corporate administration expense totaled million in  an increase of compared to these increases are attributable to additional corporate support staff  software and insurance costs  as well as approximately  spent in for development of compliance documentation required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of going forward  we expect to incur ongoing expenses for professional services related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase reflects the impact of a net increase in outstanding debt of million  primarily at fixed rates  in  related to apartment acquisitions 
during  fixed rate debt increased by million while the average rate on fixed rate debt outstanding declined from to 
variable interest rates increased by during the last half of overall  weighted average interest rates were in and in depreciation expense totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase is attributable to the addition of seven apartment communities during and and the impact of additions and replacements at other apartment communities 
we generally assign those additions and replacements shorter lives than the composite lives we assigned at the acquisition of the assets to which the additions and replacements relate 
net income operating partnership earnings before non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and write off of unamortized loan costs totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to after including these non cash charges  the operating partnership net income was  in  compared to a net loss of  in net income after the minority interest in the operating partnership net income or loss  and before deduction for cumulative preferred dividend was  in  compared to  in because the preferred shareholder has priority over common shareholders for receipt of dividends  we deduct the amount of net income that will be paid to the preferred shareholder in calculating net income available to common shareholders 
in september  we issued  shares of cumulative preferred stock  which doubled the number of preferred shares outstanding 
the cumulative preferred dividend totaled  for  compared to  for the dividend on the series b shares is per year per share  or  for the  shares currently outstanding 
income available to common shareholders in was  or on a diluted per share basis  compared to loss attributable to common shareholders in of  or on a diluted per share basis 
these favorable comparisons are primarily attributable to the positive impact of new apartment communities and improvements in apartment operating results 
compared to revenues revenues in totaled million  an increase of compared to apartment related income apartment rental income plus income from apartment management and investment activities accounted for of our total revenue in  compared to in apartment rental income in totaled million  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is attributable to rental income at five apartment communities that we acquired during and  which offsets a slight decline at other communities

apartment operations expense in represented of related apartment rental income  compared to in apartment administration expense totaled million in  an increase of compared to corporate administration expense totaled million in  an increase of compared to these increases reflected the impact of additional executive and corporate support staff and related compensation and increased corporate insurance and software costs 
interest expense totaled million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase reflected the impact of million in new debt related to apartment acquisitions since june  offset by the effect of lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
variable interest rates declined during overall  weighted average interest rates were in  compared to in depreciation expense totaled million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase was attributable to the addition of five apartment communities in and  as well as the impact of additions and replacements at other apartment communities 
net income operating partnership earnings before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization totaled million  a decrease of compared to after including these non cash charges  the operating partnership loss in was  compared to operating partnership net income of million in the minority interest in operating partnership earnings absorbed  of the loss in  compared to  of earnings in net income after the minority interest in the operating partnership net income or loss  and before deduction for cumulative preferred dividend was  in  compared to million in in september  we issued  shares of cumulative preferred stock  which doubled the number of preferred shares outstanding 
the cumulative preferred dividend totaled  for  compared to  for loss available to common shareholders in was  or 
on a diluted per share basis  compared to income available to common shareholders in of  or on a diluted per share basis 
these comparisons reflected the impact of declining margins in apartment operations in compared to  and the increased cumulative preferred dividend in  offset somewhat by the favorable impact of lower interest rates 
reclassifications in january  we adopted fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
fas generally requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations  rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under fas we reclassified the extraordinary item for loss on early extinguishment of debt in to conform to fas while adoption of fas had no impact on net income  it increased total expenses  reduced income before extraordinary items and eliminated the extraordinary item as previously reported in our annual report 
funds from operations funds from operations and funds available for distribution are defined in footnote on page both of these measures are made at the operating partnership level

recurring capital expenditures averaged per apartment unit in  per apartment unit in  and per apartment unit in capital resources and liquidity capital resources we intend to pursue our growth strategy through the utilization of our flexible capital structure 
this may include the issuance of operating partnership units  common stock and or preferred stock  additional debt  and joint venture investments 
we may use our lines of credit or variable and fixed rate  long term debt to acquire and refinance apartment communities 
long term debt all of our properties are encumbered by or serve as collateral for debt 
as of december   total long term debt was million  including million at effective fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding at december   was  compared to at december  during  we issued million in four new fixed rate notes payable at effective rates ranging from to  and retired a fixed rate note payable at 
as a result of these transactions  the weighted average rate on our fixed rate notes payable declined from at the end of to at the end of also during  we issued million in new variable rates notes  retired one million variable rate note  and reduced our variable rate line of credit by million  for a net increase in variable rate notes payable of million 
the weighted average rate on our variable rate notes payable increased from at the end of to at the end of  primarily as a result of increases in variable rates during the last half of at our level of variable rate debt  a fluctuation in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by  in june  we modified our revolving line of credit with a bank secured by the latitudes apartments to increase the maximum loan amount to million  extend the term of the loan through november  and reduce the variable interest rate on outstanding amounts to day libor plus 
we currently have million available for draw under this line of credit 
a summary of scheduled principal payments on long term debt is included in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the notes to the financial statements in this annual report 
significant scheduled balloon payments include maturities of o our deed of trust loan for harris hill apartments  due june million outstanding at december   o our line of credit secured by deeds of trust and assignments of rents of our restaurant properties  due january million outstanding at december o our revolving line of credit secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of latitudes apartments  due november up to million  million outstanding at december   o deed of trust loans for six apartment communities due in totaling million  o deed of trust loans for five apartment communities due in totaling million  and o deed of trust loans for five apartment communities due in totaling million 
the deed of trust loan for harris hill apartments expires in june based on our estimate of the underlying value of the property  we expect to refinance this loan at a lower rate than the loan currently in place 
capital stock and operating partnership units at december   we had million common shares and million preferred shares outstanding 
in addition  there were million operating partnership minority common units outstanding 
during  we issued million new common shares  through two placements  to a number of institutional investors and mutual funds  for net proceeds of million 
we also issued  common shares through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan for proceeds of million  and  common shares through our employee stock option and incentive plan for net proceeds of million 
we applied these proceeds to acquire apartment properties and reduce our operating line of credit 
in addition  we issued  common shares in non cash transactions to redeem a like number of operating partnership minority units 
in addition  during the operating partnership issued  common units in conjunction with acquisitions of apartment properties 
all of the operating partnership units held by minority interest owners were issued in through in conjunction with acquisitions of apartment communities 
holders of operating partnership units generally are able to redeem their units for cash or  at our option  for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis after one year from issuance 
cash flows and liquidity net cash flows from operating activities totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in cash flows from operating activities in is primarily attributable to the positive impact of new apartment communities in and and improvements in apartment operating results 
investing and financing activities focused primarily on apartment acquisitions and capital expenditures at apartment communities  along with payments of dividends and distributions 
during the three year period  we acquired a total of ten apartment communities five in  two in  and three in we paid dividends to common shareholders of per share per quarter in each quarter of and  and per share per quarter in each quarter of our payout ratio the ratio of common dividends plus distributions paid  divided by operating partnership funds from operations was in  in  and in we intend to pay dividends quarterly  expect that these dividends will substantially exceed the distribution requirement for reits  and anticipate that all dividends will be paid from current funds from operations 
we generally expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
we believe that net cash provided by operations is  and will continue to be  adequate to meet the reit operating requirements in both the short and the long term 
we anticipate funding our future acquisition activities primarily by using short term credit facilities as an interim measure  to be replaced by funds from equity offerings  long term debt  or joint venture investments 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities 
we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
we received of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in  from rent received from boddie noell enterprises for the use of our restaurant properties 
in addition  enterprises is responsible for all of the costs associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
over time  we expect that restaurant rental income will continue to represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
enterprises is a privately owned company with total assets exceeding million and net equity exceeding million 
its principal line of business is the operation of hardee s restaurants 
in addition to its hardee s operations  enterprises is the owner of texas steakhouse and saloon  a casual dining concept with restaurants  cafe carolina  a cafe bakery fast casual dining concept with seven restaurants  and bbq and ribs  a fast food barbeque concept with two restaurants 
enterprises also operates four moe s southwestern grills 
in addition to its restaurant operations  enterprises conducts extensive real estate investment and development activities through bne land and development 
these activities involve a full range of property types  including land  commercial  retail  office  apartment and single family properties 
we have had extensive discussions with management of enterprises and have reviewed their financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and forecasts 
we believe that enterprises will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease as well as its general corporate operating needs 
contractual obligations in december  we entered into agreements to acquire a portfolio of four apartment communities containing a total of  apartment units 
the aggregate purchase price for the properties will be approximately million  and consists of the assumption or refinancing of up to million of debt on the properties  with the remaining amount estimated at million to be paid in operating partnership units 
we expect to complete these acquisitions by the end of march we currently manage these apartment communities on a contract basis 
our other contractual obligations as of december   are summarized as follows all amounts in thousands payments due by period less more than than total year years years years long term debt obligations      operating lease corporate office purchase obligation reconstruction of apartment building at latitudes total      off balance sheet arrangements in january  we acquired boddie investment company bic through a merger 
we issued  shares of common stock  and cancelled  shares of common stock that bic held immediately before the merger 
the value of this transaction was million 
as a result of this acquisition  we have assumed the role of general partner and acquired certain economic interests in three limited partnerships interest in marina shores associates one limited partnership  interest in the villages of chapel hill limited partnership  and interest in the villages of chapel hill phase limited partnership 
prior to this acquisition  we managed the apartment communities owned by these partnerships on a contract basis  we will continue to manage these properties 
we expect that  going forward  we will include the accounts of marina shores apartments in our consolidated financial statements  and that marina shores will generate revenues  expenses and cash flows commensurate with the properties in which we own interest 
we have not completed the detailed analyses necessary to determine whether we will consolidate the villages of chapel hill and the villages of chapel hill phase  however  we do not expect that our interest in these partnerships will have a significant impact on our financial condition or operating results 
inflation we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to the company 
the leases at our apartment properties are short term in nature 
none are longer than two years 
the restaurant properties are leased on a triple net basis  which places the risk of rising operating and maintenance costs on the lessee 
environmental matters phase i environmental studies performed on the apartment communities when we acquired each of them did not identify any problems that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
environmental transaction screens for each of the restaurant properties in did not indicate existence of any environmental problems that warranted further investigation 
enterprises has indemnified us under the master lease for environmental problems associated with the restaurant properties
