our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of sponsorship and advertising contracts 
sponsorship revenues are derived principally from contracts designed to support a customer s broad marketing objectives  including brand promotion  awareness  product introductions and online research 
sponsorship agreements typically include the delivery of impressions on our web sites and occasionally the design and development of customized sites that enhance the promotional objectives of the sponsor 
an impression is the viewing of promotional material on a web page  which may include rich media and display or banner advertisements  links  or other text or images 
as part of a few sponsorship agreements  sponsors selling products may provide us with a commission on sales of their products generated through our web sites 
to date  amounts received from the sale of sponsor s products have not been significant 
advertising revenues are derived principally from short term advertising contracts in which we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee or based on actual impressions delivered 
sponsorship and advertising revenues for fixed fee contracts that are both time and impression based are recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that we have no continuing obligations and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over total guaranteed impressions or the straight line basis over the period of service 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
sponsorship and advertising revenues in which the customer specifies the timing of the delivery of impressions and payment is due upon delivery of impressions are recognized when the impressions are delivered and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
in certain instances the customer reports impression delivery to us 
these impression reports are compared to our internal traffic reports for accuracy 
we also derive sponsorship and advertising revenues from sponsored links appearing on an ivillage web page that is based upon relevant content or a world wide web search query result 
these revenues are earned on a cost per thousand impressions and or a percentage of the advertiser s net revenue and are recognized upon notification from the search engine provider

fixed assets and intangibles depreciation of equipment  furniture and fixtures and computer software is provided for by the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided for over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement 
the cost of additions  and expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing assets  are capitalized  and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred 
amortization of intangible assets are over the expected life of the related asset and range from one to ten years 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas  regarding the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
we assess the recoverability of our fixed assets and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balance over the assets remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted forecasted cash flows 
if undiscounted forecasted cash flows indicate that the unamortized amounts will not be recovered  an adjustment will be made to reduce the net amounts to an amount consistent with forecasted future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated when estimating future discounted cash flows 
future cash flows are based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performances  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
web site development costs ivillage accounts for web site development costs in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for web site development costs  or eitf  which requires that certain costs to develop web sites be capitalized or expensed  depending on the nature of the costs 
amortization of web site development costs is provided for by the straight line method over the estimated useful life of two years 
goodwill sfas no 
 business combinations requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination shall be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then an analysis will be performed to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
fair value is typically based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or market based comparables 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no  accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the difference between our us federal statutory rate of  as well as our state and local rate  net of our federal benefit of  when compared to our actual effective tax rate of  is principally attributed to a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
if we continue to generate pre tax income in future periods  a partial or full reversal of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets may be required  and such reversal may be material in the period in which the reversal is recorded 
the decision to reverse the valuation allowance will  among other things  consider our profitability in recent periods  as well as our future profitability and available tax planning strategies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience  the review of the agings and analysis of specific customer accounts 
management estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates and assumptions made by us include those related to fair values utilized to allocate revenue under eitf  the useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets  the recoverability of fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets and deferred tax assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the assessment of expected probable losses if any of claims and potential claims 
results of operations in accordance with sfas no  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  segment information is being reported consistent with our method of internal reporting 
in accordance with sfas  operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
we are organized primarily by subsidiaries and divisions 
our subsidiaries and divisions have no operating managers that report to the chief operating decision maker 
the chief operating decision maker reviews information at a consolidated results of operations level  although the chief operating decision maker does review revenue results of subsidiaries and divisions 
as a result  our discussion of revenue has been organized into separate subsidiaries and divisions  however  operating expenses and results of operations are discussed on a combined basis 
we believe the following factors may contribute to the variability of our results of operations from period to period the timing of our recognition of revenue  the volatility of the online advertising market  the timing of our sponsored events and symposiums  the loss of a contract from a major customer  an interruption or malfunction in service from our primary third party service providers  the date of commencement of a sponsorship and advertising campaign  and the date of completion  and receipt of customer approval for the creative and or distribution services of a custom publication  which is based upon a customer s advertising and marketing initiatives

custom publications revenue increased approximately year over year due to an increase in the number of publications created and distributed in as compared to there were five publications created and distributed in as compared to three publications in licensing fees increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  primarily due to the commencement of a larger number of agreements in which hospitals pay an annual fee for the newborn channel 
as of december   hospitals have agreed to pay a fee for the newborn channel  as compared to hospitals for the corresponding period in the decrease in sponsorship and advertising revenues of approximately for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  was primarily due to a decrease in advertising placements in ivpn s publications and video  and a lower number of customers advertising on the newborn channel in total revenues of ivpn for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in revenues from the sale of custom publications of approximately million and sponsorship and advertising of approximately million 
the increase in custom publications revenues was due to an increase in the size of the publications and increased copies distributed 
additionally  ivpn began to charge an annual fee to hospitals for the newborn channel in revenue generated from these fees was approximately million for the year ended december  in  wal mart stores  inc and its affiliates  or wal mart  indicated to us that they would no longer be utilizing ivpn to create and distribute custom publications which were used for baby promotions in wal mart s united states stores 
these publications accounted for approximately million  or  of ivpn s total revenues for the year ended december   approximately million  or  for the year ended december  and approximately million  or  for the year ended december  a failure to enter into contracts to replace these revenues would adversely affect ivpn s business  financial condition and results of operations 
pag years ended december  subscription based programs    events    consulting other barter percent of pag s revenues 
the aggregate of this column does not equal due to rounding 
revenues from pag accounted for approximately of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in pag s revenues remained relatively unchanged year over year for the years ended december  and the decrease in revenues from events of approximately million  or  was primarily due to lower revenues earned on an annual event in october  which we believe was caused by the then impending election 
revenues from pag for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in consulting and other revenues resulting from a consulting agreement signed in  with no comparable agreement in  of approximately million  in addition to an increase of approximately million  from various annual events held by pag  due to increased sponsorship dollars and higher attendance 
customer concentration our five largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues for each of the years ended december  and and approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  in  one advertiser  hearst  a related party  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in in  hearst accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in in  procter and gamble and hearst each accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and unilever accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in at december   no single customer accounted for more than of our total net accounts receivable  and at december   hearst accounted for approximately of our net accounts receivable 
our largest customers have varied over time in the past  and we anticipate that they will continue to do so in the future 
we do expect  however  that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on revenues from a small number of customers 
for example  during wal mart indicated to us that they would no longer be utilizing ivpn to create and distribute custom publications used for baby promotions in wal mart s united states stores 
although wal mart has never accounted for more than of our total revenues on an annual basis  they have accounted for more than of our total revenues on a quarterly basis 
a failure to enter into contracts to replace these revenues would adversely affect ivpn s  and could adversely affect our  business  financial condition and results of operations 
consequently  the loss of even a small number of our largest customers at any one time may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  unless we are able to enter into contracts to replace lost revenue

the decrease in payroll  severance and related expenses was primarily due to the capitalization of salaries associated with the redesign of our web site in accordance with eitf of approximately million

for the year ended december   we reversed approximately million of previous years accruals included in operating expenses  primarily due to the renegotiation of a vendor contract in the second quarter of which had substantial changes in the terms and conditions from the original contract and provided for a one time benefit of approximately million 
in addition  in  we established and reversed approximately million of accruals due to changes in estimates 
for the corresponding period in  we reversed  in total  approximately million and for  we reversed  in total  approximately million  of accruals included in operating expenses due to changes in estimates on services previously provided for 
these amounts were offset by additional accruals for various operating expenses 
lease restructuring charge and impairment of fixed assets in the second quarter of  we abandoned a significant portion of our new york leased real estate 
as a result  we incurred a lease restructuring charge of approximately million 
in addition  we wrote off fixed assets of approximately million that were impaired with the abandonment of the leased space and reduced the liability for deferred rent associated with the abandoned leased space by approximately million 
in july  we entered into a lease amendment with the landlord of our new york headquarters that became effective on august  the lease amendment provided for a reduction in leased space  as well as a reduction in rent per square foot 
in connection with the lease amendment  we surrendered the approximately million classified as restricted cash to the landlord  resulting in a lease restructuring charge of approximately million and prepaid rent of approximately million  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the lease 
in addition  we expensed fixed assets of approximately million that were transferred to the landlord  reduced the liability for deferred rent associated with the reduction of leased space by approximately million and reversed the remaining lease restructuring liability of approximately million 
there are no comparable amounts for the years ended december  and depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of total revenues 
for  depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately million  or of total revenues 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization for compared to was primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets and fixed assets in the second and third quarters of associated with the restructuring of our headquarters lease  the restructuring of the business operations of the promotions 
com division  and changing the webstakes 
com business model  each of which reduced the cost basis on which depreciation and amortization is calculated 
in addition  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated or amortized in  as well as the intangible assets acquired in the women 
com acquisition being fully amortized in june depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of total revenues 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses for as compared to was primarily due to several intangible assets being fully amortized in and the impairment of intangible assets and fixed assets in the second and third quarter of  reducing the cost basis on which depreciation and amortization was calculated  partially offset by amortization expense on intangible assets acquired with the promotions 
com acquisition in april impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets no impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets was recorded for the year ended december  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets for the year ended december  was approximately million  or  of total revenues 
for  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets was approximately million  or  of total revenues 
the million impairment recorded for the year ended december  was attributable to the restructuring of the business operations of the promotions 
com business unit and changing the webstakes 
com business model in the second quarter of the million impairment recorded for the year ended december  resulted from the annual impairment test performed in accordance with sfas upon completion of this test  the fair value of a reporting unit did not exceed the reporting unit s carrying amount and an impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of interest income  net interest income  net primarily includes interest income from ivillage s cash balances and interest earned on stockholders notes receivable 
interest income  net was approximately million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   approximately million  or less than of total revenues  for the year ended december   and approximately million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  interest income increased for as compared to primarily due to higher average net cash and cash equivalent balances stemming from our public offering completed in july interest income  net decreased from to primarily due to the repayment of the nbc loan in the first quarter of and lower cash and cash equivalents balances in other income expense  net other income  net was approximately million  or less than of total revenues for the year ended december   and approximately million  or of total revenues for the year ended december  for the year ended december   other expense was approximately  or less than of total revenues 
in  other income  net primarily includes moneys received from a legal settlement  distribution in a bankruptcy claim acquired in the acquisition of promotions 
com and from a reversal of a previously established purchase accrual relating to a bankruptcy claim acquired in the acquisition of women 
com

gain on sale of joint venture interest and other assets gain on sale of joint venture interest and other assets was approximately million for the year ended december   and approximately million for the year ended december  both amounts represent approximately of total revenues 
there was no amount for the year ended december  gain on sale of joint venture interest resulted from the restructuring of our tesco relationship in march  under which a division of tesco purchased our entire ownership interest in ivillage uk 
the gain on sale also related to amounts we received pursuant to the license agreement entered into with the tesco division contemporaneously with such restructuring 
income tax expense income tax expense was approximately million  or less than of total revenues  for the year ended december  there were no comparable amounts for the years ended december  and income tax expense relates to state taxes owed by a subsidiary stemming from ownership of equipment in many different states 
the subsidiary files these returns on a stand alone basis  and as such can not utilize our consolidated net operating loss carryforwards 
ivillage has undergone several ownership changes as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
as of december   we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  of which approximately million are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million  approximately million are subject to an annual limitation of million and approximately million have no annual limitation 
the net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in future changes in our ownership may result in annual limitations on the amount of carryforwards which we can realize in future periods 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize this asset in the future 
to the extent that deferred tax assets created as a result of our acquisitions reverse in future periods  the benefit of the reversal will be recorded as goodwill 
in addition  to the extent that deferred tax assets  created as a result of excess stock compensation deduction  reverse in future periods  the benefit of this reversal will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
the difference between our us federal statutory rate of  as well as our state and local rate  net of our federal benefit of  when compared to our actual effective tax rate of  is principally attributed to a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
if we continue to generate pre tax income in future periods  a partial or full reversal of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets may be required  and such reversal may be material in the period in which the reversal is recorded 
the decision to reverse the valuation allowance will  among other things  consider our profitability in recent periods  as well as our future profitability and available tax planning strategies 
discontinued operations during  approximately million was reversed from a previously established reserve  due to a change in estimate  and is included in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain on discontinued operations 
net income loss we recorded net income of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december   and a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december   and recorded a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  we achieved net income for the year ended december   compared to a net loss in  primarily due to the following in higher revenues of approximately million  and lower operating expenses  excluding the events listed below  of approximately million 
in lease restructuring charges and related impairment of fixed assets associated with our new york office leased space of approximately million  and the restructuring of our promotions 
com business resulting in an impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets of approximately million 
the decrease in net loss for the year ended december   compared to the same period in was primarily due to the following in the adoption of sfas which resulted in a change in accounting principle charge of approximately million  and our negotiated termination of an advertising agreement with nbc that required us to purchase television advertising of approximately million  and pay a termination fee of approximately million in the first quarter of in lower online media and hearst print expense of approximately million  and lower depreciation and amortization of approximately million 
the decrease in net loss for was offset by the following lower revenues of approximately million  lease restructuring charges and related impairment of fixed assets due to the abandonment renegotiation of leased real estate of approximately million  and the restructuring of the promotions

recent events on january   ivillage acquired all of the outstanding equity of healthology  inc  a privately held company and a leading producer and distributor of physician generated video and article based health and medical information on the internet 
the aggregate purchase price  inclusive of transaction related expenses  was approximately million consisting of approximately million in cash and  shares of ivillage s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents include money market accounts 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and at times these balances exceed insurable amounts 
net cash provided by operating activities improved by approximately million to million for the year ended december   from net cash used of approximately million for the year ended the overall increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the comparable period in was primarily from an improvement in the results of operations  as adjusted by non cash items  of approximately million  and the utilization of a prepaid amount of approximately million in  as compared to a cash outlay of approximately million in  which is associated with the restricted cash surrendered to the landlord in consideration of our lease renegotiation  offset by an increase in restricted cash and other assets of approximately million in compared to a utilization of approximately million in  which was primarily due to the surrender of cash to the landlord in consideration of our new york office space lease renegotiation  and a lower amount of deferred revenue recognized in of approximately million  primarily from the completion of our october unilever agreement 
net cash used in investing activities increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended the overall increase in net cash used in investing activities for compared to was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of fixed assets of approximately million  consisting mostly of hospital video equipment and capitalized web site development costs  and the acquisition of the virtual mirror  inc in november of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the overall increase in cash provided by financing activities for compared to was primarily attributable to proceeds from the securities offering completed in july of approximately million  net of offering costs of approximately million  and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately million 
except for  we have historically incurred net losses and negative cash flows on an annual basis 
however  management believes that ivillage s current funds will be sufficient to enable ivillage to meet its planned expenditures through the next twelve months 
factors that could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations include the loss of any of our major customers or a significant downturn in the advertising market or economy  in general 
additional factors that could have an adverse affect are described below under risks as well as elsewhere in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
ivpn currently broadcasts television programming to hospitals via a hour  days a week satellite broadcast 
upon the expiration of the contract or in the event of an unforeseen earlier interruption of service  we would need to either negotiate a new contract  find another satellite provider and or invest in alternative technology to distribute the service 
ivpn is in the process of converting many of its hospitals from the satellite broadcast to a new system that eliminates the need for a constant satellite feed 
this new technology will only require a limited amount of satellite time each month resulting in reduced operating costs in ivpn estimates that it will cost approximately million to million to convert to the new technology  of which approximately million has been incurred 
in  ivpn initiated the collection of an annual fee from hospitals to receive programming broadcast by ivpn 
these fees result from agreements between ivpn and the hospitals that generally have a length of three to five years 
as of december   approximately of participating hospitals have agreed to pay this fee  however  we can make no assurance that all of the hospitals will agree to pay a fee 
the total value of signed contracts at december  is in excess of million  which will be recognized as revenue over the next several years 
our february advertising agreement with unilever  as amended  provided for a unilever advertising purchase commitment of million 
this agreement expired in june in october  we entered into a new agreement with unilever that terminated the february advertising agreement and provide for unilever s purchase of an additional million in advertising and receipt of the remaining advertising not received under the previous agreement of approximately million 
the new agreement expired in december and no amount remains to be earned 
pursuant to the amended and restated magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst  hearst committed to purchase from us between approximately million and million of production and advertising services over a three year period ending in june this agreement also provided for revenue sharing between hearst and us with respect to advertising revenues obtained by us from the hearst magazine web sites and our other web sites containing substantial hearst content 
this revenue sharing arrangement required that we pay hearst a royalty payment  based on net advertising revenues  of at least approximately million during the three year term of the agreement 
this amount would be reduced on a pro rata basis if hearst failed to expend its stated annual minimum in production fees in any year of the agreement 
in addition  if a shortfall in production fees occurred in any year of the agreement  hearst would be required to place additional advertising in an amount equal to of the production fee shortfall 
in july  we entered into a three year web site services agreement with hearst that supersedes and replaces the amended and restated magazine content license and hosting agreement we assumed as part of our acquisition of women 
com 
pursuant to the web site services agreement hearst will pay to us a production and service fee of million during the first year of the renewed agreement which would increase by approximately million in each subsequent year  we will continue to receive a commission on magazine subscription sales and if magazine subscription sales do not reach a certain threshold in the second year of the new agreement  then we will not be entitled to any commission from magazine subscriptions sales in the third year of the new agreement  we will no longer be required to offer hearst  and hearst would no longer be obligated to purchase  advertising on ivillage 
com  and hearst will continue to receive a commission from us on a percentage of the advertising sales from the hearst magazine web sites we host  the commissions paid to and received from hearst will vary based on performance 
revenues from this agreement are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
consequently  our work efforts  which include a significant amount of production services performed during the first year of this agreement  do not coincide with the timing of our revenue recognition on this agreement 
as of december   we have received million and earned approximately million in connection with this agreement 
in december  we signed a web site services agreement in which hearst will pay approximately million for production  maintenance and hosting services for three teen web sites seventeen 
com  cosmogirl 
com and teen 
com 
the agreement terminates in december as of december   we have received approximately million and earned approximately million in connection with this agreement 
in march  we restructured the terms of our joint venture so that a division of tesco purchased our entire ownership interest in ivillage uk 
we also entered into a twenty year agreement with that division  subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events  whereby we will license to ivillage uk certain of our content and intellectual property  including trademarks and copyrights  for use in the united kingdom and ireland in exchange for the greater of a minimum monthly license fee or a percentage of ivillage uk s gross revenues 
in november  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the virtual mirror  inc  whose primary asset is gardenweb 
com  a leading community of gardeners  offering content  web forums  community exchanges  and reference tools focused on horticulture 
the purchase price was approximately million 
we lease office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through april in addition  in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with various service providers for ad serving  satellite transmissions and license content arrangements 
the following is a schedule of future minimum non cancelable contractual obligations and the affect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods as of december  in thousands total less than year years years thereafter non cancelable operating leases     purchase obligations     total contractual obligations     capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended december  and were primarily for hospital video equipment  computer hardware and software purchases as well as the capitalization of certain web site development costs 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services  the amount of resources we devote to investments in our business  including entering into joint ventures with and or the acquisition of other entities  the resources we devote to marketing  the resources we devote to building the infrastructure necessary to enable us to sell subscription based products and services  and the resources we devote to selling our products and services 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with advertisers and sponsors  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these indemnifications to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no related liabilities are recorded as of december  we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain indemnifications and  historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these obligations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no  or fin  r  consolidation of variable entities  or fin r 
fin r replaces the same titled fin that was issued in january fin r requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by a company that bears the majority of risk of loss from the variable entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns  or both 
the provisions of this interpretation are effective for ivillage beginning in the first quarter of fiscal ivillage s adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on its financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payments  or sfas r  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
statement of cash flows 
the statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
the statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which ivillage receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of ivillage or liabilities that are based on the fair value of ivillage s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the effective date of the statement is for periods beginning after june  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of three methods the modified prospective method  the modified prospective method to january   or the modified retrospective method to all prior years for which sfas was effective 
ivillage has not yet determined which adoption method it will utilize 
in addition  ivillage s stock employee purchase plan will need to be modified to comply with sfas r 
the statement could have a significant impact on the consolidated statement of operations as ivillage will be required to expense the fair value of stock option grants 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 or sfas sfas eliminates an exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets under apb opinion no 
 and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is to be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe that the future adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
legal proceedings ivillage and women 
com are defendants in class action lawsuits in federal court relating to each company s initial public offering 
in june  parties agreed in principle to settle the matter  along with similar lawsuits against more than other issuers 
on february   the court issued an opinion and order granting preliminary approval to the settlement and ordering the plaintiffs and issuer defendants to submit to the court a revised settlement stipulation consistent with the court s order 
the court has scheduled a conference for march  to discuss the status of the stipulation  to make final determinations as to the form and substance of plaintiff s required notice to its class members and to schedule a fairness hearing to allow for any plaintiff to object to the settlement 
there has been no further ruling on this matter 
we believe  based upon the advice of outside legal counsel  that the aforementioned lawsuit and claims asserted against us and our subsidiary pursuant to these complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
if the proposed settlement in the initial public offering laddering cases is ultimately not approved by the courts  defending against these claims could require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could harm our business 
we are not currently subject to any other material legal proceedings 
we may from time to time  however  become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
risk factors we operate in an environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
risks of our business we have a limited history of profitability  and we may have further continuing losses from operations 
we achieved net income on an annual basis for the first time for the year ended december  we have incurred significant net losses on an annual basis in each year of our operations  have a history of negative cash flows and may incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we achieved net income of approximately million for the year ended december  we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we achieved net income for the year ended december   we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase net income on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenues grow slower than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  we could continue to suffer losses 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are not indicative of future performance  are difficult to forecast and have been and are likely to continue to fluctuate 
we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators of future performance 
this makes it difficult to forecast with certainty quarterly and annual revenues and results of operations 
in addition  our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from fiscal quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of several factors  many of which are outside our control  and any of which could materially harm our business 
some of these factors include fluctuations in the demand for advertising or electronic commerce fluctuations in marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs the unpredictability of our success in new revenue and cost reduction initiatives changes in the level of traffic on our network of web sites the timing of the creative services and or distribution services performed on custom publications or magazines based upon customers advertising and marketing initiatives volatility in the media market bankruptcies or other payment defaults of companies that are a source of revenues our revenues for the foreseeable future will remain primarily dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on our web sites and  as a result  are difficult to forecast 
in addition  the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor may be lengthy  especially for larger  higher rate contracts  and is subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including advertisers and sponsors budgetary constraints advertisers and sponsors internal reviews the possibility of cancellation or delays of projects by advertisers or sponsors the success and continued internal support of advertisers and sponsors own development efforts we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected reduction in revenues in a particular fiscal quarter or year  which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our operating results may fluctuate depending on the season  and such fluctuations may affect our stock price 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results because of seasonal fluctuations in traditional online advertising purchasing patterns 
the number of our sponsorships and advertisements tend to be significantly lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  due primarily to decreased spending because of advertising budgets and retail promotions for the holiday season 
however  there can be no assurance that our sales in the remaining quarters will exceed those of the first and third calendar quarters 
further  securities analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our results of operations in one or more future quarters and  consequently  our operating results may fall below expectations  causing our stock price to decline 
we have a small number of major customers and the loss of any number of these customers or a material reduction in business we receive from any of these customers could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on revenues from a small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of even a small number of our largest customers or a material reduction in the business we receive from any of these customers at any one time could significantly reduce our revenue  which in turn could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  unless we are able to enter into contracts to replace lost revenues 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues for each of the years ended december  and and approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  in  one advertiser  hearst  a related party  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in in  hearst accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in in  procter and gamble and hearst each accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and unilever accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in at december   no single customer accounted for more than of our total net accounts receivable  and at december   hearst accounted for approximately of our net accounts receivable 
during wal mart  inc and its affiliates  or wal mart  indicated to us that they would no longer be utilizing our subsidiary  ivpn  to create and distribute custom publications which were used for baby promotions in wal mart s united states stores 
these publications accounted for approximately million  or of our total revenues in  approximately million  or of our total revenues in and approximately million  or of our total revenues in a failure to enter into contracts to replace these revenues could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because our largest customers have varied over time in the past  we anticipate that they will continue to do so in the future 
the significance of revenues from any one of our customers can vary on a quarter to quarter basis as a result of the number and timing of such customers advertising and marketing initiatives and the mix of products and services such customers purchase from us 
restrictions on our ability to enter into sponsorship  advertising or other business relationships with hearst s competitors may adversely affect our business 
our web site services agreement governing our magazine content license and hosting relationship with hearst restricts our ability to enter into relationships with competitors of hearst 
these restrictions may prevent us from expanding our network and enhancing our content and the visibility of our brand  and may cause us to forego potential advertising revenues from competitors of hearst 
specifically  the agreement provides that we may not  without hearst s consent enter into any agreement to include in our network any web sites for magazines that compete with hearst magazines display on our web pages the brands  logos  trademarks or proprietary content of both hearst and a hearst competitor display on the hearst magazine web sites any advertising or other promotional materials from magazines that compete with hearst magazines our principal investors investments in our competitors may result in conflicts of interest that could harm our business 
our principal investors  such as hearst and rho capital partners  inc may have conflicts of interest by virtue of their own businesses  as in the case of hearst  or investments in other companies that may compete with us 
these investments may result in a conflict of interest for our principal investors or result in the diversion of attractive business opportunities from our principal investors to other companies 
we are unable to determine all of the competing investments held by these principal investors 
in addition  we do not have the ability to constrain the investment activity of any of our principal investors and therefore cannot predict the extent of any future investments in businesses that are competitive with us 
our business is highly dependent upon user traffic 
our business is inherently dependent upon high user traffic levels 
the rates we charge to advertisers and sponsors and the number of products and services we sell are directly related to the number of users visiting ivillage s web sites 
user traffic from certain web sites that are non proprietary to ivillage are generally included in the reported information regarding our network of web sites 
these properties include the hearst magazine web sites and other parties who have agreed by contract to have traffic from their web sites incorporated within our network 
the number of users visiting our web sites may decline 
in addition  hearst or other third parties may discontinue allowing us to include their web sites as part of our network for traffic reporting purposes 
any decline in user traffic levels may cause our revenues to decrease and could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will be materially adversely affected if we cannot maintain the popularity of our web site offerings among internet users 
we will be successful only if a critical mass of internet users  especially women  continue to view our web sites as popular destinations on the internet 
it is difficult to predict the rate at which users will sample our offerings and the extent to which they will become members and or return users 
at any time  users of our services might revert to other offerings 
we cannot assure you that widespread use and acceptance of our offerings will occur 
if we cannot maintain the popularity of our offerings among internet users  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
there is intense competition among media companies focused on women  and this competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
increased competition could result in advertising and sponsorship price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are a large number of web sites competing for the attention and spending of members  users and advertisers 
our web sites compete for members  users and advertisers with the following types of companies web search and retrieval and other online service companies  commonly referred to as portals  such as time warner s aol service  microsoft corporation s msn service and yahoo inc publishers and distributors of traditional media  such as television  radio and print cable networks targeting women  such as oxygen media  inc  women s entertainment network and lifetime television e commerce companies such as amazon 
com  inc online services or web sites targeted at women  such as lifetimetv 
com lamaze publishing s magazines directly compete with publishers of pre and post natal publications such as gruner and jahr  primedia and time inc these publishers have substantially greater marketing  research and financial resources than lamaze publishing 
increased competition may result in less advertising in lamaze publishing s magazines and a decline in lamaze publishing s advertising rates  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to attract and retain key personnel  our business would be materially adversely affected 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly douglas w 
mccormick  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
mccormick s current employment agreement expires in may although we are currently in discussions with mr 
mccormick related to the renewal of his employment agreement  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain his services 
the loss of the services of mr 
mccormick would likely harm our business 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our senior management 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications as a result of our financial condition and relatively low common stock price 
as a result  we have in the past and may in the future incur increased salary and benefit costs 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  our business  and our ability to develop and execute on our business strategies  will be materially harmed 
we rely on third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services 
we depend on various third parties for software  systems and related services  including saavis  verio  globix  google  doubleclick  tacoda and prospero 
in addition  we sometimes rely on our customer s software reporting tools to supply us  subject to our monitoring controls  with the information to record our revenue 
if for any reason one or more of these service providers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our product and service offerings to our advertisers  sponsors and users could be severely impaired 
we would have to identify and qualify substitute service providers  which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operational difficulties 
although we are confident that alternative service providers are available  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such services on as favorable terms as we currently receive or in a timely manner 
we rely on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of our user base 
it is important to our advertisers that we accurately measure the demographics of our user base and the delivery of advertisements on our web sites 
we depend on third parties to provide many of these measurement services and to do so accurately and reliably 
if these third parties are unable or unwilling to provide these services to us in the future  we would need to perform them ourselves or obtain them from another provider 
this could cause us to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in our business until these services are replaced 
companies may choose not to advertise on our web sites or may pay us less for our sponsorship or advertising if they perceive our demographic measurements as not reliable 
we are subject to legal proceedings that could result in liability and adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we have been  and expect to continue to be  subject to legal proceedings that individually  or in the aggregate  could adversely affect our business 
notably  several plaintiffs have filed class action lawsuits in federal court against us  several of our former executives  and our underwriters in connection with our march initial public offering 
a similar class action lawsuit was filed against women 
com  several of our former executives and women 
com s underwriters in connection with women 
com s october initial public offering 
in june  the parties agreed in principle to settle the matter  along with similar lawsuits against other issuers 
the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the court in june  which was accompanied by a brief filed by the issuer defendants in support of the plaintiffs motion 
certain of the underwriter defendants formally objected to the settlement 
the plaintiffs and issuer defendants separately submitted replies to these objections on august  on february   the court issued an opinion and order granting preliminary approval to the settlement and ordering the plaintiffs and issuer defendants to submit to the court a revised settlement stipulation consistent with the court s order 
the court has scheduled a conference for march  to discuss the status of the stipulation  to make final determinations as to the form and substance of plaintiff s required notice to its class members and to schedule a fairness hearing to allow for any plaintiff to object to the settlement 
there has been no further ruling on this matter 
if the proposed settlement is ultimately not approved by the courts  even if these claims are not meritorious  defending against them could require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could harm our business 
our operation of ivpn poses a number of risks that could materially adversely affect our business strategy 
there are a number of risks in operating ivpn related to lamaze publishing  baby steps magazine and the channels  which are all primarily non internet businesses  including the competitiveness of the media  television and publishing industries our ability to continue to commercialize and protect the lamaze mark our ability to sell advertising and sponsorships on ivpn s magazines  videos  the channels and our web sites demand for our custom publications and controlled circulation magazines our ability to identify and predict trends in a timely manner that may impact consumer tastes in baby and health related information on the channels our failure to perform the functions required for the operation of ivpn in an efficient and timely manner could result in a disruption of ivpn s operations that could result in a loss of revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business strategy 
our business could be adversely affected if transmission of the channels were interrupted 
there is a risk that the satellite or the in hospital delivery system which transmits the channels may malfunction  which would result in an interruption of broadcasts 
extreme adverse weather conditions or third parties could damage or disable receivers and transmitters on the ground hindering transmission of the channels signal 
ivip is currently in negotiations with ascent and has entered into an interim letter agreement with ascent  dated as of march   regarding the continued provision of distribution  maintenance and installation services until a definitive services agreement mutually acceptable to the parties can be executed 
the interim letter agreement is presently scheduled to expire on march  if we are not able to enter into a definitive agreement or in the event of an unforeseen earlier interruption of service  we would need to negotiate a new contract  find another satellite provider and or invest in alternative technology to distribute the service 
if any of these events occur  there may be a period of time before transmission of all or some of the channels could resume 
any interruption in our ability to transmit the channels could jeopardize our viewer base and negatively impact our revenues related to the channels 
our ability to offer continuing medical education programs through healthology could be adversely affected by changes in governmental regulation and industry guidelines 
we offer online continuing medical education  or cme  to physicians and other healthcare professionals through healthology 
healthology typically collaborates with a medical society or other healthcare professional association to create a cme  which upon proper review and approval receives the accreditation of such organization 
in some instances  healthology or the accrediting entity receives an educational grant from a pharmaceutical or medical device company to fund the creation and production of the cme 
in an effort to ensure that cme programs remain independent from the interests of healthcare goods and service providers who fund the development of cme  many entities have revised their standards of accreditation 
in addition these sponsorships may be subject to regulation by state and federal agencies 
in the event that the sponsorship of cme by pharmaceutical or medical device companies should become subject to additional regulatory scrutiny  any resulting changes to existing regulations or accreditation standards  or changes in internal compliance procedures of sponsors  may result in revision to healthology s cme offering  a slow approval process for the accreditation  and a reduction in the number of cme sponsorships 
if we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with healthology s distribution network  our business could be adversely affected 
healthology s business depends  in part  on establishing and maintaining syndication distribution partners who are willing to pay content license fees and or provide revenue to healthology for advertising proximate to such content 
several of these partners are high traffic web sites for which there is intense competition for relationships with these entities and placement on their sites 
we may be unable to enter into or successfully renew relationships with these entities or sites on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
many companies that healthology may approach for a strategic relationship or who already have strategic relationships with healthology may also receive health and medical information from other sources 
as a result  these companies may be reluctant to enter into or maintain strategic relationships with healthology 
healthology s revenues could be negatively impacted if we do not establish additional  and maintain their existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms 
we may not be able to expand our business through acquisitions and joint ventures and  even if we are successful  our operations may be materially adversely affected as a result of an acquisition or joint venture 
our business strategy includes growth through business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to implement this business strategy 
our ability to implement this business strategy depends in large part on our ability to compete successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners 
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully in this regard include our financial condition relative to the financial condition of our competitors our ability to obtain additional financing from investors the attractiveness of our common stock as potential consideration for entering into these types of transactions as compared to the common stock of other entities competing for these opportunities our available cash  which in turn depends upon our results of operations and the cash demands of our business many of the entities with which we compete for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  our ability to make acquisitions using our stock has been materially adversely affected by the overall decline in the trading price of our common stock over the last several years 
if  despite these factors  we are successful in entering into additional business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures 
our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures will depend  in part  on our ability to overcome or address the difficulties of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and the potential disruption of our ongoing business the need to incorporate successfully the acquired or shared technology or content and rights into our products  services and media properties the difficulties of establishing a new joint venture  including the need to attract and retain qualified personnel and the need to attract customers and advertisers the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel or reduction of personnel the difficulties of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies in addition  completing acquisitions could require use of a significant amount of our available cash 
furthermore  we may have to issue equity or equity linked securities to pay for future acquisitions  and any of these issuances could be dilutive to existing and future stockholders 
acquisitions and investments may also have negative effects on our reported results of operations due to acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles  and or actual or potential liabilities  known and unknown  associated with the acquired businesses or joint ventures 
any of these acquisition related risks or costs could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain effective internal financial and managerial systems  controls and procedures  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
in the past  we have sought cost reductions through increased managerial efficiencies and expense reduction initiatives  including targeted staff reductions 
these reductions in workforce placed a significant strain on our managerial staff  financial controls and operational resources as our employees have assumed greater responsibilities and learned to manage their increased workload with reduced resources 
we continue to evaluate our operational and financial systems and our managerial controls and procedures to determine what additional changes  if any  might help us to manage our current operations better 
we face the risk that our systems  procedures and controls might not be adequate to support our operations or to maintain accountability for our assets 
any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in financial accounting standards or practices  including those that require us to recognize employee stock options as a compensation expense  could substantially and adversely affect our financial results 
the accounting rules applicable to our business have undergone significant changes in recent years  and future changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to the expensing of employee stock options  could cause us to account for our business in ways that may adversely affect our financial results and investor perception of those results 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  currently we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized for options granted to employees where the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
on december   fasb issued sfas r which requires us  for the period beginning after june   to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options and restricted stock  granted to employees 
this is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  as the stock based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings 
we expect that our implementation of sfas r will result in a reduction of our net income or an increase in our losses as a result of these non cash expenses 
in such an event  investor perception of our results of operations may be adversely affected and our stock price may fall 
risks related to our industry the operating performance of computer systems and web servers is critical to our business and reputation 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  due to a computer virus or otherwise  that causes an interruption in our internet offerings could result in reduced traffic on our web sites and reduced revenues for our business 
substantially all of our communications hardware and some of our other computer hardware operations are located at saavis facilities in new jersey  verio s facilities in california and globix s facilities in new york 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
we do not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal comprehensive disaster recovery plan 
our web sites could also be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems  such as those historically experienced by several leading web sites 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
if we experience outages or degraded service  user satisfaction would decrease  we would likely lose advertising revenue and our reputation and brands could be permanently harmed 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
in addition  we cannot assure you that saavis which purchased the assets of cable and wireless plc and exodus communications  inc both of which had filed for bankruptcy protection  verio and globix will be able to provide sufficient services for us or that we would be able to engage satisfactory alternative service providers 
if the internet fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising  we would have slower revenue growth than expected and could incur losses 
we compete with traditional advertising media  including television  radio and print  along with other high traffic web sites  for sponsorships and advertising expenditures 
although there are currently several standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising  the industry has had difficulty convincing potential advertisers that internet advertising is  at minimum  comparable to traditional forms of advertising 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have historically relied on these traditional forms may be reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising 
in addition  advertisers and advertising agencies that use the internet as an advertising medium may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services than traditional advertising media 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources in traditional methods of advertising may also be reluctant to reallocate their resources to online advertising 
moreover  software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
if the market for online advertising develops more slowly than we expect  or if we are unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising  we would have slower than expected revenue growth and could incur losses  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
web based business models are still evolving and make it difficult to predict our long term revenues 
a decrease in revenues relating to changes in internet advertising pricing models or our inability to convert users to purchasers of our products and services could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet  including models based on the number of impressions delivered  the number of click throughs by users and the number of key words to which an advertisement is linked 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the models will emerge as the industry standard 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to project our long term advertising rates and revenues 
furthermore  consumer reluctance to subscribe to or pay for internet content may limit our ability to supplement internet advertising as our most significant source of revenue in the foreseeable future 
inability to supplement our advertising revenues could limit our growth and adversely affect our business 
we may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in our industry 
our product and service offerings compete in a market characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent innovations and evolving industry standards 
a growing number of individuals access the internet through devices other than personal computers  such as cell phones  personal digital assistants or television set top devices 
the low resolution  functionality and memory currently associated with some of these alternative devices might prevent or impede users from accessing our graphics rich web sites 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our offerings 
we could incur substantial costs to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to the changing technology environment 
possible infringement by third parties of our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove difficult or impossible 
any infringement or misappropriation by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we have invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and potential future use 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entitled to use these domain names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other desired domain names will be available 
new privacy and data security laws may require changes in our practices  and there is a potential for enforcement actions due to noncompliance 
any new law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise seriously harm our business 
there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and the quality of products and services 
there is a trend toward more burdensome regulations and stiffer penalties  all of which could negatively impact our business 
there is also a trend toward giving consumers greater information and greater control over how their personal data is used  and requiring notification where unauthorized access to such data occurs 
in particular  several jurisdictions  including foreign countries  have recently proposed and or adopted privacy related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited e mail solicitations  commonly known as spamming  and that impose significant monetary and other penalties for violations 
these laws may increase concern on the part of advertisers regarding advertising in our e mail newsletters  and advertisers may seek to impose indemnity obligations on us in an attempt to mitigate any liability under these laws 
moreover  internet service providers may increasingly block legitimate marketing e mails in an effort to comply with these laws 
one such law  the can spam act of  or can spam  became effective in the united states on january  can spam imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial e mail 
the language of can spam contains ambiguities  and can spam has yet to be interpreted by the courts 
depending on how it is interpreted  can spam may impose burdens on our e mail marketing practices  on joint marketing initiatives that we undertake with our business partners  and on features of our services 
can spam also requires the federal trade commission  or ftc  to report to congress regarding the advisability of a federal do not e mail registry 
if the registry is created  it could have a detrimental effect on our ability to continue our e mail marketing practices as well as advertisers willingness to participate in e mail marketing 
also regarding can spam  the ftc has issued its final rule  to take effect on march   establishing criteria for determining whether the primary purpose of an e mail message is commercial for purposes of compliance with can spam 
in adopting the final rule  the ftc rejected many pro business interpretations of the primary purpose standard that had been proposed by marketing companies  and the final rule will impose further burdens on our business 
in addition to impacting our business through decreased collection and use of user data  the enactment of privacy and data security laws may increase our legal compliance costs 
while we believe that we comply with currently applicable laws  as such laws proliferate there may be uncertainty regarding their application or interpretation  which increases our risk of non compliance 
even if a claim of non compliance against us does not ultimately result in liability  investigating a claim may present a significant cost 
future legislation may also require changes in our data collection practices  which may be expensive to implement and may further increase the risk of non compliance 
data security laws are becoming more stringent in the united states and abroad 
third parties are engaging in increased cyber attacks against companies doing business on the internet  and individuals are increasingly subjected to identity and credit card theft on the internet 
although we seek to use what we consider to be industry standard security measures  there is a risk that we may fail to prevent such activities and that users or others may assert claims against us 
in addition  the ftc and state consumer protection authorities have brought a number of enforcement actions against us companies for alleged deficiencies in those companies data security practices  and they may continue to bring such actions 
enforcement actions  which may or may not be based upon actual cyber attacks or other breaches in such companies data security  present an ongoing risk of liability to us  could result in a loss of users and could damage our reputation 
we may face potential liability  loss of users and damage to our reputation for violation of privacy practices 
our privacy policies generally prohibit the sale or disclosure to any third party of any member s personal identifying information for marketing purposes  absent prior consent 
growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and or litigation 
in the past  the ftc has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy 
if we are accused of violating the stated terms of any of our privacy policies  we may face a loss of users and damage to our reputation and be forced to expend significant amounts of financial and managerial resources to defend against these accusations and we may face potential liability 
in addition  part of our business involves marketing to consumers who have expressed an interest in receiving health related information from us 
this aspect of our business has grown with our recent acquisition of healthology  inc  a company that provides health related content and marketing offers to consumers 
many jurisdictions  including the united states  have adopted complex and burdensome regulations in connection with marketing activities involving personally identifiable medical information  to the extent that such regulations may apply to us  they create additional business and liability risks  and greater legal compliance costs  for us 
we may be liable if third parties misappropriate our users personal information 
third parties may be able to hack into or otherwise compromise our network security or otherwise misappropriate our users personal information or credit card information 
if our network security is compromised  we could be subject to liability arising from claims related to  among other things  unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
in such circumstances  we also could be liable for failing to provide timely notice of a data security breach affecting certain types of personal information 
consumer protection privacy regulations could impair our ability to obtain information about our users  which could result in decreased advertising revenues 
in general  we ask our members and users to opt in to receive special offers and other direct marketing opportunities from us  our advertisers and partners 
our network also requests and obtains personal data from users who register to become members of the network 
registration as a member is required in order for users to have full access to the services offered by our network 
personal data gathered from members is used to personalize or tailor content to them and is provided  on an aggregate basis  to advertisers to assist them in targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups 
current or prospective advertisers evaluate our ability to provide user data to support targeted advertising 
privacy concerns may ultimately cause users to resist providing personal data 
if we become unable to collect personal data from a sufficient number of our users  we may lose significant advertising revenues 
changes in public acceptance of e mail marketing  and the perception of security and privacy concerns  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our use of personal data 
our failure to implement industry standard platform for privacy preferences protocols could discourage users from using our web sites  products and services and from providing their personal data to us 
in addition  pending and recently enacted legislative or regulatory requirements that businesses notify consumers that their data may be used by or disclosed to marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the consumer may heighten these concerns 
moreover  there appears to be a trend in newer privacy laws to treat a company s affiliates as third parties for purposes of consumer disclosure or notification requirements  which further restricts our business and creates potential liability 
our network also uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive or browser  possibly without the user s knowledge  but is generally removable by the user 
information gathered from cookies is used by us to tailor content to users of our network and may also be provided to advertisers on an aggregate basis 
in addition  advertisers may themselves use cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws directly or indirectly limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
other tracking technologies  such as so called pixel tags or clear gifs  are also coming under increase scrutiny by legislators  regulators and consumers  imposing liability risks on our business 
in addition  legal restrictions on cookies  pixel tags and other tracking technologies may make it more difficult for us to tailor content to our users  making our network less attractive to users 
similarly  the unavailability of cookies  pixel tags and other tracking technologies may restrict the use of targeted advertising  making our network less attractive to advertisers and causing us to lose significant advertising revenues 
we may face potential products liability claims based upon our ivillagesolutions products 
although we phased out our vitamin and neutraceutical product offerings in  as with other retailers  distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that such products result in injury or death 
we may still be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products contained contaminants or included inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover any liabilities and may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost 
our business could be affected by future terrorist attacks or acts of war 
the terrorist attacks in the united states in recent years disrupted global commerce 
the continued threat of future terrorist attacks in the united states  and particularly in new york city where our headquarters are located  acts of war involving the united states  or any response of the united states government to any future terrorist actions or acts of war  may cause future significant disruptions in commerce throughout the world 
the proximity of our headquarters to certain possible targets in new york city could  in the event of war or future terrorist attacks  result in damage to or destruction of our headquarters as well as the permanent or temporary loss of key personnel 
we have not developed a disaster recovery plan and we cannot assure that our insurance coverage would adequately reimburse us for any damages suffered as a result of a terrorist attack or act of war 
risks related to our common stock as of march   hearst owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and had three representatives on our board of directors 
as a result  hearst is able to significantly influence our corporate direction and policies 
hearst s board representation and stock ownership allows hearst to significantly influence our corporate direction and policies  including any mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  strategic relationships or sales of assets 
hearst s board representation and stock ownership may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which our stockholders would otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as of march   hearst owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to an amended and restated stockholder agreement we entered into with hearst on june   we appointed three hearst representatives to our board of directors  with one hearst designee appointed to each class of director 
the amended and restated stockholder agreement provides that the number of hearst representatives is subject to reduction if hearst s ownership of our common stock falls below certain threshold levels 
there is also a hearst representative on our nominating and compensation committees 
although hearst is required to vote all shares that it holds in excess of subject to adjustment of our outstanding voting securities in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors  hearst may effectively control certain stockholder actions  including approving changes to our certificate of incorporation or by laws and adopting or changing equity incentive plans 
hearst s effective control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger  consolidation  sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other form of change of control that we might consider 
in addition  the interests of hearst  which owns or has significant investments in other businesses  including cable television networks  newspapers  magazines and electronic media  may from time to time compete with  or otherwise diverge from  our interests  particularly with respect to new business opportunities and future acquisitions 
market fluctuations or volatility could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to raise capital 
the stock market in general and the market for stocks of internet based companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
the trading price of the securities of internet companies has been highly volatile and is likely to remain so in the future 
we believe that in the past similar levels of volatility have contributed to the decline in the trading price of our common stock  and may do so again in the future 
trading volumes of our common stock can increase or decrease dramatically  resulting in a volatile trading price for our common stock 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that significant sales could occur 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been brought against companies that experienced volatility in the trading price of their securities 
market fluctuations in the price of our common stock could also adversely affect our ability to sell equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
public market analysts and investors have not been able to develop consistent financial models for the internet market because of the unpredictable rate of growth of internet use  the rapidly changing models of doing business on the internet and the internet s relatively low barriers to entry 
our sales cycle is also unpredictable and sales to advertisers or sponsors forecasted in a particular period may be delayed or may not otherwise occur based upon the timing of our customers own marketing initiatives 
as a result  and because of the other risks and uncertainties noted in this report  our actual results might not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in future periods 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 
our future capital raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities  which would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
raising funds through the issuance of equity securities will dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
furthermore  we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock 
a negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
future sales of our stock could affect our share price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares sold by directors or officers and shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or in connection with acquisitions  the trading price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents include interest bearing accounts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our interest bearing accounts 
we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial assets 
while we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions  at times these balances exceed insurable amounts
