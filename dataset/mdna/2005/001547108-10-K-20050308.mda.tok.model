item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in millions  except per share and per ton amounts operations overview the company s continuing operations consist of seven steelmaking and finishing plants that produce flat rolled carbon steels  including premium quality coated  cold rolled and hot rolled products  and specialty stainless and electrical steels that are sold in slab  hot band  sheet and strip form 
these products are sold primarily to the domestic automotive  appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  as well as to distributors  service centers and converters 
the company s continuing operations also include ak tube llc  ak tube which further finishes flat rolled carbon and stainless steel into welded steel tubing 
in the third quarter of  ak tube acquired arvinmeritor s central tubing facility in columbus  indiana 
in addition  the company operates european trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products 
on march  the company completed the sale of douglas dynamics  llc  the largest north american manufacturer of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders for four wheel drive light trucks 
on april  the company completed the sale of greens port industrial park on the houston  texas ship channel 
on april   the company completed the sale of sawhill tubular products  a manufacturer of a wide range of steel pipe and tubing products 
for all periods presented  the results of douglas dynamics  greens port industrial park and sawhill tubular are classified as discontinued operations 
the company operates in a cyclical industry that was particularly hard hit by the economic downturn that continued until the end of a number of steel companies  including large and small competitors of ak steel  filed for bankruptcy protection during that downturn 
nonetheless  the level of domestic competition 
table of contents remains high  because many of the steelmaking assets of these businesses were purchased through the bankruptcy process and are being operated by companies that are able to enjoy cost advantages resulting principally from the elimination of large portions of their predecessors retiree pension and healthcare costs  a reduced workforce and a significant reduction in the number of job classes 
during the economic downturn  the company also faced significant competitive challenges and a deteriorating financial condition 
through an aggressive and systematic effort to improve its relations with its customers  reduce costs and conserve cash  the company was able to return to profitability and began to generate positive cash flow 
with an environment of improved customer relations  an improving economy and the realization of cost savings from initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced significant improvements in in its shipments  sales and operating results  excluding the pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges 
value added shipments continued to trend higher  and the company benefited from higher spot market pricing and raw material and energy surcharges which increased average pricing to a record level 
sales to the spot market comprised approximately of total net sales in also  the company was successful in negotiating higher prices for sales to approximately of its contract customers commencing in many of these new contracts include a variable pricing mechanism and or a raw material and energy surcharge 
the company continued to improve its cash position  ending the year with of cash and of availability under its two credit facilities  representing total liquidity of despite this financial improvement  there were continued financial challenges in for the fourth year in a row  the company recognized non cash fourth quarter pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges  which accelerate the recognition of actuarial losses 
the company had to contend with extremely high and unprecedented costs for raw materials and energy  as well as its high levels of long term debt and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
because of the nature of its business  it also incurred significantly increased costs to comply with stringent  and in some instances new  environmental regulations 
for example  in  the company committed to spend approximately to install new environmental equipment at its middletown works to comply with newly enacted regulations governing particulate emissions 
the company was able to partially mitigate these unfavorable factors by aggressively improving productivity and quality  lowering operating and overhead costs  reducing discretionary spending wherever prudent  and where possible  adding surcharges to the price of carbon  stainless and electrical steel product sales 
compared to steel shipments in and were  tons and  tons  respectively 
the year to year increase was primarily a result of strong demand from customers in the automotive  appliance  construction and manufacturing markets along with strong demand from spot market service center customers 
value added products comprised of total shipments for  up from for on significantly higher shipments of coated and cold rolled carbon steel products 
in addition  improved conditions in the stainless and electrical steel markets contributed to a increase in tons shipped for these products as compared to tons shipped by product category for and were as follows tons in thousands stainless electrical coated cold rolled tubular subtotal value added shipments hot rolled secondary subtotal non value added shipments total shipments 
table of contents net sales in were a company record  compared to  in  due primarily to higher shipment volumes  an improved product mix and higher spot market prices across all product lines 
average selling prices increased to per ton in from per ton in due to general price increases and raw material and energy surcharges  both primarily on sales in the spot market 
the price increases reflect the global increase in demand for steel  while the surcharges were initiated in an effort to recover a portion of unprecedented increases in the costs of energy  particularly natural gas  and certain key raw materials  including nickel  chrome  steel scrap  purchased slabs  coal and coke 
during  the percentage of ak steel s sales attributable to the spot market primarily distributors  service centers and converters increased significantly as the result of higher steel prices and the implementation of raw material and energy surcharges 
the company was only able to implement a surcharge on a small portion of its contract sales in  which then represented approximately of its total sales 
as a result of the increased prices in the spot market and resulting higher revenues  the company s automotive sales represented about of its total sales  a decline from prior years 
sales attributable to major market groups as a percent of total sales for and were as follows automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and converters the company s reported operating losses for the years and were and  respectively 
included in these results were two large pre tax expense charges  which are described more fully below 
excluding these items  as explained in detail below  results in an adjusted operating profit of for and an adjusted operating loss of for exclusion of these charges from the operating losses is presented in order to clarify the effects of these charges on our operating results and to reflect the operating performance of the company on a comparative basis for and the goodwill impairment charge is not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years 
the pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges are recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the company s unique method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  a method which  to our knowledge  no other domestic manufacturing company employs 
while these corridor adjustments have recurred over the past four years  it is nearly impossible to reliably forecast or predict whether they will re occur in future years or  if they do  at what magnitude 
they are taken only in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and are driven mainly by events and circumstances beyond the company s control  primarily changes in interest rates  health care cost trends  mortality and retirement assumptions 
we believe that reporting operating profit and loss on an adjusted basis  which is a non gaap financial measure  is helpful in reflecting our current operating results and providing investors with a transparent insight into our overall financial performance 
in addition  the adjusted operating results allow for comparability to the reported results of our competitors when analyzing the company s financial performance versus that of other steel companies 
we view the reported results of adjusted operating profit loss as an important operating performance measure  and as such  we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is operating profit loss 
adjusted operating profit loss is used by our management as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business because we believe that this non gaap measure  when analyzed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations  provides additional insight into the financial trends of ak steel s business versus the gaap results alone 
we also believe that investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on adjusted operating income as a substitute for any gaap financial measure and we encourage investors and potential investors to review the reconciliations of adjusted operating profit loss to the comparable gaap financial measure 
while we believe the non gaap measures allow for comparability to our competitors  the most significant limitation on that comparison is the company immediately recognizes the pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges in the fourth quarter of the current year 
however  our competitors do not recognize these pension and other postretirement costs immediately  but instead  amortize these costs over future years 
management compensates for the limitations of this non gaap financial measure by recommending that these non gaap measures be evaluated in conjunction with the gaap financial measures

under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognized fourth quarter corridor charges in and of and  respectively 
under this method of accounting  the company is required to recognize into its results of operations  as a fourth quarter noncash corridor adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans  or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the effect of prevailing interest rates on the discount rate used to value projected plan obligations as of the october measurement date is one of the more important factors used to determine the company s year end liability  fourth quarter corridor adjustment and subsequent year s expense for these benefit plans 
in  a one half percent reduction in the discount rate to reflect declines in prevailing interest rates  and an increase in health care trend rates caused the company to record fourth quarter corridor charges of related to its pension plans and related to its other postretirement benefit plans

compared to total steel shipments for the twelve months ended december  and were  tons and  tons  respectively 
the year to year increase was primarily due to higher shipments of hot rolled steel products that offset reduced shipments to contract customers in the automotive  appliance construction and manufacturing markets and continued weakness in the stainless and electrical steel markets 
lower contract shipments in were  in part  the result of customers lost to competitors  who brought back previously idled production capacity as the company sought to increase prices and  simultaneously  remain a predominant source of value added steels to certain contract customers

outlook all of the statements in this outlook section are subject to  and qualified by  the information set forth beginning on page under the heading forward looking statements 
building on the solid financial improvement started in  the company is forecasting further improved financial performance in for example  the company expects its shipments in to be approximately million tons  slightly higher than shipments  and the product mix is expected to be approximately value added 
during the company expects higher average selling prices  primarily the result of negotiating double digit price increases with approximately of its contract customers 
the increased revenue from these 
table of contents higher prices is expected to more than offset significant projected increases in the cost of raw materials and energy  particularly scrap  purchased slabs  iron ore  coke  coal and natural gas 
the company estimates that depreciation expense will decline by approximately from levels to approximately and expects interest expense to decrease by approximately in compared to levels  principally as the result of debt reduction 
capital expenditures in are estimated to be approximately  of which the two largest projects include the middletown works mact project and the ashland works caster and degasser project 
for tax purposes  the company expects to have a book tax rate of approximately for  although the cash tax rate is expected to be less than 
the company expects that pension and other post retirement benefit expenses will decline by approximately  excluding any potential fourth quarter pension and other postretirement benefits corridor charges 
under the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plan accounting method  the annual determination of a fourth quarter adjustment  if any  is made as of the plans october measurement date 
since the balance of deferred actuarial losses for all major pension and other postretirement benefit plans was at or near the edge of the corridor at the end of  the development of any additional net actuarial losses  which may result from a further decline in interest rates  poor investment returns or adverse changes in assumptions  would likely result in another corridor charge in the fourth quarter of the company does not anticipate any required cash payments to its pension plan trust in due to the company s improved financial performance and enhanced liquidity during  however  a voluntary million pension contribution to the pension trust was made in the first quarter of the company currently projects that this early contribution will reduce its required pension contribution to approximately see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of future funding requirements 
in the first quarter of  the company expects to ship nearly  tons  somewhat less than the  tons shipped in the fourth quarter of while the company anticipates continued strong demand for its products  planned maintenance outages at its middletown and mansfield facilities will adversely affect first quarter shipments and negatively impact pre tax earnings by approximately the outage at the company s middletown facility will be to perform maintenance work on its blast furnace 
during that outage  the company also will complete the installation of certain emission control equipment required to bring the furnace into compliance with new environmental regulations 
the mansfield outage was originally planned to occur in the second quarter 
the outage has been moved into the first quarter and will have a negative impact on operating profit  or approximately per ton 
as a result  the company now estimates first quarter operating profit of approximately per ton 
the company expects a significant increase in revenues during the first quarter as a result of previously negotiated price increases for its contract business  which is expected to account for approximately of sales 
the company also expects  however  a significant increase in its costs for raw materials and energy  particularly scrap  iron ore  coal  purchased slabs and natural gas 
after considering all of these factors  the company expects to report improved operating results for the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had of cash and cash equivalents  of availability under a accounts receivable purchase credit facility and of availability under a five year senior revolving credit facility that is secured by certain of the company s inventories 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility  however  availability under the facilities was reduced by of outstanding letters of credit and reduced pools of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
availability under both facilities fluctuates monthly with the varying levels of eligible collateral 
as a result of improved liquidity in  due primarily to the sale of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park  increased pricing and the implementation of energy and raw material surcharges  the company retired of debt ahead of its scheduled maturity 
no significant scheduled debt payments are due until during  cash generated by continuing operations totaled  due primarily to higher shipment volumes and prices in average selling prices increased to per ton in  an increase of per ton over levels 
cost of products sold  however  increased as a result of a significant rise in the prices paid 
table of contents for raw materials  particularly scrap and purchased slabs  and energy  primarily natural gas  as well as higher shipping levels 
the company used a net of cash from accounts receivable  inventories and current liabilities  due primarily to the higher level of receivables that were a result of higher pricing and increased shipments  partially offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase in current liabilities 
management believes that the company s receivable  inventory and current liability levels are appropriate in the current business environment and expects a modest net increase of these items in as a result of expected higher sales and higher raw material costs

however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to generate or obtain all of the necessary liquidity if there is a material deterioration in the steel industry or the overall economy 
the company s forward looking statement on liquidity is based on currently available information and to the extent the information is inaccurate  there could be a material adverse impact to the company s liquidity

net proceeds from the sale of these two businesses amounted to dividends the payment of cash dividends is subject to a restrictive covenant contained in the instruments governing most of the company s outstanding senior notes and in its inventory based revolving credit facility 
the covenant in its senior notes allows the payment of dividends  if declared by the board of directors  and the redemption or purchase of shares of its outstanding capital stock  subject to a formula that reflects cumulative net earnings 
as a result of cumulative losses recorded over the last three years  the company is unable to pay a dividend or redeem stock under this formula 
the restriction in the company s inventory based revolving credit facility limits dividends to annually

table of contents including the possibility of future pension legislation  the reliability of estimated future pension contributions decreases as the length of time until the contribution must be made increases 
currently  the company s major pension plans are significantly underfunded 
as a result  absent major increases in long term interest rates  above average returns on pension plan assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements  the company will be required to make contributions to its pension trusts of varying amounts in the long term 
some of these contributions could be substantial

on december   the united states government enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this act provides a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that include a qualified prescription drug benefit 
the company sponsors such a plan 
because the measurement date of the company s benefit plan preceded the effective date of the act  the company was not permitted to recognize the effects of the act until february  the company s savings in per capita prescription claim costs due to the impact of the act resulted in a reduction in its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately in  the company recognized a reduction in net periodic benefit costs related to these savings of  excluding the fourth quarter corridor charge 
labor agreements at december   ak steel s operations included approximately  employees  of which approximately  are represented by international and independent labor unions under various contracts that expire in the years through the contract for approximately mansfield hourly employees represented by the united steel workers of america was scheduled to expire on march  on february   the members of the union representing these employees voted to extend the contract through february  the labor contract representing approximately hourly employees at its ashland facility will expire on september  in addition  the ak steel s labor agreements at its middletown works  butler works  zanesville works and ak tube facility expire at various dates in these unions represent approximately  employees 
while management does not expect any disruptions in operations associated with upcoming labor negotiations  the company cannot currently predict the outcome of the contract negotiations 
however  there is a potential of a work stoppage if ak steel and its unions cannot reach agreement in contract negotiations that could have a material impact on the company s financial condition  operations and cash flow 
energy and raw material hedging the company enters into derivative transactions in the ordinary course of business to hedge the cost of natural gas and certain raw materials 
at december   current and non current assets included and  respectively  for the fair value of these derivatives 
changes in the prices paid for the related commodities are expected to offset the effect on cash of settling these amounts 
off balance sheet arrangements the company holds an equity interest in combined metals of chicago llc  which is not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the company has provided a letter of credit to support a portion of combined metals bank indebtedness proportionate to the company s equity investment

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into agreements under which it is obligated to make legally enforceable future payments 
these agreements include those related to borrowing money  leasing equipment and purchasing goods and services 
the following table summarizes by category expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations and commitments pension payment obligations other than pension retiree obligations other long term liabilities total in calculating the amounts for purchase obligations the company first identified all contracts under which the company has a legally enforceable obligation to purchase products or services from the vendor and or make payments to the vendor for an identifiable period of time 
then for each identified contract  the company determined its best estimate of payments to be made under the contract assuming the continued operation of existing production facilities  normal business levels and the contract would be adhered to in good faith by both parties throughout its term 
because of changes in the markets it serves  changes in business decisions regarding production levels or unforeseen events  the actual amounts paid under these contracts could differ significantly from the numbers presented above 
in december  the company reached an agreement with shenango incorporated for the supply of all of the company s anticipated coke purchases through the end of the supply agreement  extends and modifies an existing contract that was set to expire at the end of  and is included in the purchase obligation commitments above 
a number of the purchase contracts specify a minimum volume or price for the products or services covered by the contract 
if the company were to purchase only the minimums specified  the payments set forth in the table would be reduced 
under requirements contracts the quantities of goods or services the company is required to purchase may vary depending on its needs  which are dependent on production levels and market conditions at the time 
if the company s business deteriorates or increases  the amount it is required to purchase under such a contract would likely change 
many of the agreements for the purchase of goods and services allow the company to terminate the contract without penalty upon to days prior notice 
any such termination could reduce the projected payments 
the company s consolidated balance sheets contain reserves for pension and other postretirement benefits and other long term liabilities 
the benefit plan liabilities are calculated using actuarial assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  because changes in circumstances can have a significant effect on the liabilities and expenses associated with these plans including  in the case of pensions  pending legislation  the company cannot reasonably and accurately project payments into the future 
while the company does include information about these plans in the above table  it also discusses these benefits elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to its financial statements  set forth in item the other long term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets include reserves for environmental and legal issues  employment related benefits and insurance and other reserves 
these amounts 
table of contents generally do not arise from contractual negotiations with the parties receiving payment in exchange for goods and services 
the ultimate amount and timing of payments are subject to significant uncertainty and  in many cases  are contingent on the occurrence of future events  such as the filing of a claim or completion of due diligence investigations  settlement negotiations  documentation or legal proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles permit choices among alternatives and require numerous estimates of financial matters 
the company believes the accounting principles chosen are appropriate under the circumstances  and that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in its financial reporting are reasonable 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership passes 
this is when the products are shipped per customers instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
inventory costing inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw material  energy and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
other inventories  consisting mostly of foreign inventories and certain raw materials  are measured principally at average cost 
use of estimates accounting estimates are based on historical experience and information that is available to management about current events and actions the company may take in the future 
significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  environmental and legal liabilities  and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as a reserve for the loss that would be incurred if a customer is unable to pay amounts due to the company 
while losses due to customer defaults have been low  if in the future the financial condition of some customers deteriorates to an extent that may affect their ability to pay  additional allowances may be needed 
approximately of trade receivables outstanding at december  are due from businesses associated with the us automotive industry 
except in a few situations where the risk warrants it  collateral is not required on trade receivables 
while the company believes its recorded trade receivables will be collected  in the event of default in payment of a trade receivable  the company would follow normal collection procedures 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in estimating levels of future taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax asset  the company has considered historical results of operations and the cyclicality of the steel business and would  if necessary  consider the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to generate future taxable income 
if future taxable income is less than the amount that has been assumed in determining the deferred tax asset  then an increase in the valuation allowance will be required  with a corresponding charge against income 
on the other hand  if future taxable income exceeds the level that has been assumed in calculating the deferred tax asset  the valuation allowance could be reduced  with a corresponding credit to income 

table of contents the company is involved in a number of environmental and other legal proceedings  including some related to asbestos exposure 
the company records a liability when it has determined that litigation has commenced or a claim or assessment has been asserted and  based on available information  it is probable that the outcome of such litigation  claim or assessment  whether by decision or settlement  will be unfavorable 
the company measures the liability using available information  including the extent of damage  similar historical situations  its allocable share of the liability and  in the case of environmental liabilities  the need to provide site investigation  remediation and future monitoring and maintenance 
accruals of probable costs have been made based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies on a case by case basis and  where appropriate  are supplemented with incurred but not reported development reserves 
however  amounts recognized in the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states exclude costs that are not probable or that may not be currently estimable 
the ultimate costs of these environmental and legal proceedings may  therefore  be higher than those currently recorded on the company s financial statements 
in addition  results of operations in any future period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or by the effectiveness of the company s strategies 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into income  as a fourth quarter adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets  defined as the corridor 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
this method results in faster recognition of actuarial net gains and losses than the minimum amortization method permitted by prevailing accounting standards and used by the vast majority of companies in the united states 
faster recognition limits the amounts by which balance sheet assets and liabilities differ from economic net assets or obligations related to the plans 
however  faster recognition under this method also results in the potential for highly volatile and difficult to forecast corridor adjustments  similar to those recognized in recent years 
under the applicable accounting standards  actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the major factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses for pension plans are the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to value pension liabilities as of the measurement date 
for other postretirement benefit plans  differences in estimated versus actual healthcare costs  changes in assumed healthcare cost trend rates or a change in the difference between the discount rate and the healthcare trend rate are major factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses 
in addition to the potential for corridor adjustments  these factors affect future net periodic benefit expenses 
changes in key assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of annual expense recognized 
for example  a one percentage point decrease in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase the projected pension expense by approximately before tax 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would increase projected other postretirement benefit expense by approximately before tax 
the discount rate used to value liabilities and assets affects both pensions and other postretirement benefit calculations 
a one quarter percentage point decrease in this rate would increase pension expense by and other postretirement expense by these estimates exclude any potential fourth quarter corridor adjustments 
property  plant and equipment the total weighted average useful life of the company s machinery and equipment is years based on the depreciable life of the assets 
the company recognizes costs associated with major maintenance activities at its operating facilities in the period in which they occur 
investments the company s financial statements consolidate the operations and accounts of the company and all subsidiaries in which the company has a controlling interest 
the company also has investments in associated 
table of contents companies that are accounted for under the equity method and  because the operations of these companies are integrated with the company s basic steelmaking operations  its proportionate share of their income loss is reflected in the company s cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company holds investments in debt securities and minor holdings in equity securities  which are accounted for as available for sale or held to maturity cost investments 
the company has no investments that it accounts for as trading securities 
each of the company s investments is subject to a review for impairment  if and when  circumstances indicate that a loss in value below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  the company would write the investment down to its fair value  which would become its new carrying amount 
the company s investment in afsg holdings  inc represents the carrying value of its discontinued insurance and finance leasing businesses  which have been largely liquidated 
the activities of the remaining operating companies are being runoff and the companies are accounted for  collectively  as a discontinued operation under the liquidation basis of accounting  whereby future cash inflows and outflows are considered 
the company is under no obligation to support the operations or liabilities of these companies 
financial instruments the company is a party to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under the financial accounting standards board s fasb s statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
the company s objective in using such instruments is to protect its earnings and cash flows from fluctuations in the fair value of selected commodities and currencies 
for example  in the ordinary course of business  the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps  with a duration of up to three years  to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company designates these swaps as cash flow hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   currently valued outstanding commodity hedges would result in the reclassification into earnings of in net of tax gains within the next twelve months 
based on such reviews as it deems reasonable and appropriate  the company believes that all counterparties to its outstanding derivative instruments are entities with substantial credit worthiness 
goodwill at december  and  the company s assets included of goodwill 
each year  as required by statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an evaluation of goodwill to test this balance for possible impairment 
the evaluation requires that the reporting unit underlying the goodwill be measured at fair value and  if this value is less than the carrying value of the unit  a second test must be performed 
under the second test  the current fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the unit including an amount for implied goodwill 
if implied goodwill is less than the net carrying amount of goodwill  then the difference becomes the amount of the impairment that must be recorded in that year 
the company s businesses operate in highly cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate  which may lead to further impairment charges in future operating costs 
the annual review did not result in any additional goodwill impairment for the company 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
 entitled  consolidation of variable interest entities 
as revised  the new interpretation requires that the company consolidate all variable interest entities in its financial statements under certain circumstances 
the company adopted the revised interpretation as of march   as required and consolidated vicksmetal armco associates  resulting in no additional net income to the company

this fsp was effective upon issuance and is described in note in december  the fasb issued fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the fasb staff believes that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the act and the timing of the enactment necessitate a practical exemption to the fas requirement to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax law

table of contents the company cautions readers that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by management 
in addition to those noted in the statements themselves  these factors include  but are not limited to  the following risks of recessionary conditions in the general economy and in the cyclical steel industry  reduced domestic automotive production  changes in demand for the company s products  unanticipated plant outages  equipment failures or labor difficulties  work stoppages or production disruptions associated with labor difficulties in negotiating new labor agreements with our various labor unions which could result in material impacts to operations  operating income and cash flow  new labor agreements with unions could either enhance or negatively impact our operating costs  operating income and cash flow depending on the success of our labor negotiations  actions by the company s domestic and foreign competitors  their employees and labor unions  interest rate volatility and declining prices in the securities markets  which affect pension plan assets and the calculation of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expenses  continuing escalation in medical cost trend rates that affects active employee and retiree benefit expenses  unanticipated increases in the prices for  or disruptions in the supply of  raw materials and energy  particularly natural gas  scrap  coal  coke  iron ore and purchased carbon slabs  unexpected outcomes of major litigation  environmental issues and other contingencies  changes in application or scope of environmental regulations applicable to the company  changes in united states trade policy and governmental actions with respect to imports  particularly the possible impact of restrictions or tariffs on the importation of carbon slabs  timely completion of business or asset purchases and sales  including receipt of regulatory agency approvals  and that future expected cost savings from a business combination or cost reduction initiatives may not be realized 
unanticipated developments in the above items could negatively impact the company s operating costs  operating income and or cash flow 
except as required by law  the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect future developments of events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company s market risk includes changes in a interest rates  b the prices of raw materials and energy sources  and c foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages interest rate risk by issuing substantially all of its debt securities on a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of this debt as of december  is  which was determined primarily from valuations provided by financial consultants 
a reduction in prevailing interest rates or improvement in the company s credit rating could increase the fair value of this debt 
a reduction in the rate used to discount total future principal and interest payments of would result in an increase in the total fair value of the company s long term debt of approximately an unfavorable effect on the company s results and cash flows from exposure to interest rate declines and a corresponding increase in the fair value of its debt would result only if the company elected to repurchase its outstanding debt securities at prevailing market prices 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials 
in recent years  natural gas prices  in particular  have increased significantly and have been highly volatile 
at normal consumption levels  a per mcf change in natural gas prices would result in an approximately change in annual pre tax operating results  excluding the offsetting effects of any then existing hedging instruments 
in addition  due to increased demand from foreign steel producers  the costs of unfinished carbon steel slabs and scrap both of which are purchased by the company and are not susceptible to hedging have risen significantly and those cost increases have adversely affected the company s margins 
however  in the first quarter of  the company began adding a surcharge to the price of steel sold to the spot market to offset price increases paid for purchased slabs  scrap and natural gas 
in addition  in the case of stainless steel  increased costs for nickel  chrome and molybdenum can usually be recovered through established price surcharges 
approximately of the company s sales in were made under annual or long term contracts 
those sales contracts generally did not permit adjustment of selling prices in response to changes in the costs of raw materials and energy 
in  however  approximately of the company s sales contracts will permit such adjustments 
therefore  a rise in the price of energy particularly natural gas  raw materials such as scrap  purchased slabs  coal  iron ore  or other commodities will be  in part  passed on to the company s contract customers rather than absorbed solely by the company in in addition  in order to further minimize its exposure to fluctuations in raw material costs  and to secure an adequate supply of raw materials  the company has entered into multi year purchase agreements for certain raw materials that provide for fixed prices or only a limited variable price mechanism 
while enabling the company to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in raw material costs  this also exposes the company to an element of market risk relative to its sales contracts 
currently  most of the company s sales contracts expire at the end of when new contracts are negotiated with the company s customers  the average sales prices could change  either up or down 
if that average sales price decreases  the company may not be able to reduce its raw material costs to a corresponding degree due to the multi year term and fixed price nature of some of its raw material purchase contracts 
the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps and or options to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company s hedging strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility 
however  abnormal price increases in any of these commodity markets could negatively impact operating costs 
gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss did not include any unrealized net of tax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments 
the following table presents the negative effect on pretax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december  due to an assumed and decrease in the market price of each of the indicated commodities 
commodity derivative decrease decrease natural gas aluminum zinc because these instruments are structured and used as hedges  these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the physical commodity used in the normal production cycle 
the company currently does not enter into swap or option contracts for trading purposes 
the company is also subject to risks of exchange rate fluctuations on a small portion of intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies 
forward currency contracts are used to manage exposures to certain of these currency price fluctuations 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward currency contracts
