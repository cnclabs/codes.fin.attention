item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using tank barges  tugboats and oil tankers to provide marine transportation services primarily along the gulf and atlantic coasts of the united states 
the company owns and operates one of the largest fleets serving the us coastwise trade  consisting of four oil tankers and eleven oceangoing married tug barge units with an aggregate fleet capacity of approximately million barrels 
between and  the company has transported at least million barrels annually  with a high of million barrels in and a low of million barrels in in and  the company has transported million and million barrels  respectively 
many factors affect the number of barrels transported and may affect future results for the company 
such factors include the company s vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the cont inuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies decisions as to the type and origination point of the crude that it processes  changes in the amount of imported petroleum products  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
demand for the company s services is driven primarily by the demand for crude oil in the northeastern us and refined petroleum products in florida and the northeastern us this demand is impacted by domestic consumption of petroleum products  us refining levels  product inventory levels and cold weather in the northeast 
in addition  competition from foreign imports of refined petroleum products in our primary markets  as well as demand for refined petroleum product movements from the us gulf refining system to the us west coast could also have an impact on demand for the company s services 
maritrans has successfully rebuilt five of its existing  single hulled  barges to a double hull design configuration  which comply with the provisions of the opa see table in legislation under item 
the company intends to 
back to contents apply the same methodology to all of its remaining single hull barges 
sixty four percent of the company s fleet capacity is double hulled 
the company holds patents for its double hulling technology and has been rebuilding its single hull barges to double hulls since  in preparation for upcoming government mandated retirements of single hull vessels 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and each of the company s superbarges represent approximately to percent of the total fleet capacity  which will be removed from revenue generating service during the rebuilding of that vessel 
results of operations to supplement its financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  the company s management has used the financial measure of time charter equivalent tce  a commonly used industry measure where direct voyage costs are deducted from voyage revenue 
maritrans enters into various types of charters  some of which involve the customer paying substantially all voyage costs  while other types of charters involve maritrans paying some or substantially all of the voyage costs 
the company has presented tce in this discussion to enhance an investor s overall understanding of the way management analyzes the company s financial performance 
specifically  the company s management used the presentation of tce revenue to allow for a more meaningful comparison of the company s financial condition and results of operations because tce revenue essentially nets the voyage costs and voyage revenue to y ield a measure that is comparable between periods regardless of the types of contracts utilized 
these voyage costs are included in the operations expense line item on the consolidated statements of income 
tce revenue is a non gaap financial measure and a reconciliation of tce revenue to revenue  the most directly comparable gaap measure  is set forth below 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues tce revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was as follows december  december  voyage revenue voyage costs time charter equivalent vessel utilization available days revenue days tce revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of  million or percent  due to an increase in rates and was partially offset by lower vessel utilization 
rates voyage revenue consists of revenue generated under term contracts as well as revenue generated for spot market transportation 
rates in each of these markets are significant drivers in the amount of revenue generated by the company 
spot market revenue in was million compared to spot market revenue of million 
the company increased its exposure to the spot market in the second half of and had higher exposure than in spot market rates were higher in than in as the result of the impact of world and oil industry events and vessel supply as discussed below 
low product inventories relative to product demand in the areas the company serves generally increases demand for transportation of clean products 
during  a number of factors caused a reduction of product inventories and 
back to contents increased demand for the company s services 
they included colder winter weather  reduced imports for much of the year due to higher demand for transportation fuels in europe and asia coupled with higher international transportation rates  and increased product demand due to economic growth 
in the fourth quarter  refineries reduced their inventory levels for year end resulting in an increased demand for transportation 
during much of there were a large number of us jones act vessels transporting cargos from the gulf of mexico to the west coast due to higher demand for gasoline blend components as a result of the mtbe ban in california and washington 
this also increased demand for transportation 
additionally  in  two competitor jones act vessels in the  barrel size range reached their opa retirement dates or were scrapped 
all of these factors caused increases in spot rates in the increased rates  couple d with higher spot market exposure  resulted in increased spot revenue for the company 
contract revenue in was million compared to contract revenue of million 
contract rates remained strong and were higher in than in as the company obtained modest increases in rates on its renewed contracts 
demand for black oil transportation  which is sensitive to crude refining utilization in the delaware valley refineries  was higher in than in and resulted in increased revenue under contracts 
although rates were higher in  fewer vessels worked in the contract market due to the company s decision to increase its spot exposure 
as a result of these combined factors  contract revenue was consistent with the company believes rates will remain steady or increase during compared to due to increased product demand in the markets the company serves and continued reduction in the supply of jones act vessels 
the company expects exposure to the spot market to be similar in to its exposure in the fourth quarter of and a majority of the company s business is expected to remain on contract during the company believes that exposure to the spot market will allow the company to take greater advantage of anticipated market conditions in the greater spot exposure may impact utilization and revenues  however  due to the inherently less predictable transportation demand that accompanies this strategy 
utilization vessel utilization is also a significant driver in the amount of revenue generated by the company 
utilization decreased in from levels 
the decrease in utilization had a negative impact on voyage revenue and resulted primarily from higher vessel out of service time for double hull rebuilding and vessel repairs in compared to the ocean states was taken out of service early in september for her double hull rebuild and returned to service early in the third quarter of as the m the ocean was taken out of service later in the third quarter of for her double hull rebuild and is expected to return to service in the second quarter of as the m in addition  late in the fourth quarter of  several design issues were identified on three of the double hull rebuilt  barrel class barges that led the company to remove these vessels from service and further inspect and re analyze the original rebuild designs 
working with industry experts and the american bureau of shipping  the company identified and implemented structural enhancements that improved the long term strength of these three barges  and the barges returned to service in the first quarter of the decrease in utilization was also caused by weather related delays during the third quarter of during that period  the company experienced three significant storms that affected vessels working in the gulf of mexico at that time and resulted in a loss of approximately operating days across the fleet 
as a result of the aforementioned utilization factors  barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  barrels also decreased due to a higher proportion of longer voyages  particularly to the west coast 
the company anticipates utilization to be at a similar or higher level in than in due to fewer vessels being out of service for double hull rebuilding and continued strong demand for the company s services which is expected to be offset by a higher level of scheduled out of service time for regulatory maintenance 
operations expense voyage costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent 
fuel costs increased million or percent compared to the same period in the average price of fuel increased percent compared to port charges increased million due to the increased west coast moves resulting from increased spot exposure 

back to contents operations expenses  excluding voyage costs discussed above  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent 
crew expenses increased million due to seagoing salary and benefit increases as well as a higher level of training compared to the same period in shoreside support expenses increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in personnel  employment related expenses and higher shoreside related insurance premiums 
these increases were offset by lower training costs for shoreside personnel and lower operations related professional fees compared to the same period in the cost of supplies for the vessels also increased million compared to the same period in during the second quarter  the company reversed approximately million of previously recorded insurance cl aims and deductibles that no longer required a related liability 
this reversal partially offset the increases in expenses discussed above 
maintenance expense maintenance expenses decreased million or percent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  routine maintenance incurred during voyages and in port for the year ended december  was consistent with the year ended december  expenses accrued for maintenance in shipyards decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the company continuously reviews upcoming shipyard maintenance costs and adjusts the shipyard accrual rate to reflect the expected costs 
increases in regulatory and customer vetting requirements  which increases the scope of maintenance performed in the shipyard  result in higher shipyard costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  professional fees increased million as a result of additional litigation expenses and increased audit fees primarily related to additional services necessary to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the remainder of the increase resulted from higher expenses incurred as a result of increased shoreside personnel  employment related expenses and higher non vessel related insurance premiums

back to contents impact of recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  by the company 
the company will be adopting the provisions of sfas r as of july   using the modified prospective method 
the company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january  using the modified prospective method described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
currently  the company uses the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expects to continue using this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of statement r on july  because statement r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  and because the company adopted statement using the modified prospective method which applied only to award granted  modified or settled after the adoption date  compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under statement will be recognized under statement r 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements
