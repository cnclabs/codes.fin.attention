item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which appear elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the corporation is a financial holding company which  through its bank and non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of banking offices located throughout its market area 
the corporation s primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from its loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
the corporation s net income was million  a decrease of from net income of million 
earnings per share in declined to per share  compared to per share in the decrease in net income was partly due to the corporation s strategic decisions to redeem certain long term borrowings which adversely impacted net income in the current year 
management expects this to positively impact net income in future periods 
the early redemption of long term borrowings included the following early redemption of fhlb advances in december  the bank refinanced million of federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb borrowings resulting in an early redemption penalty of million that was charged to operations affecting earnings per share by approximately per share  net of tax 
these borrowings were refinanced with a short term  fixed rate fhlb advance of million 
the refinanced advance had an average rate of  and had scheduled maturities between february and september the new advance has a fixed rate of  is not convertible and matures in march the advance will be repaid from an increase in money market funds during the first quarter of the refinancing provided the bank with the ability to lower its interest expense and reduce its reliance on longer term  fixed rate borrowings 
issuance redemption of junior subordinated debentures the corporation issued approximately million of junior subordinated debentures debentures in  and redeemed approximately million of debentures 
the net result of these issuances and redemptions was to reduce the interest rate on long term borrowings 
million of debentures were issued in march  with a five year fixed rate of  converting to a floating rate thereafter and maturing in million of debentures were also issued in march  with a floating interest rate at issuance also maturing in in december  the corporation issued an additional million of debentures with a five year fixed rate of  converting to a floating rate thereafter and maturing in on september   the corporation redeemed all of its  year junior subordinated debentures that it had issued in  for a redemption price of million 
in connection with this redemption  approximately 
million of unamortized issuance costs were expensed affecting earnings per share by approximately per share  net of tax 
operations in were also impacted by the following significant factors continued geographic expansion the bank continues to invest in its core market areas 
a new branch office opened in martinsburg  west virginia during in addition  approximately million was spent in for several land acquisitions in a new market area  morgantown  west virginia 
construction of the first branch office in this market area was substantially completed at the end of  and the branch was opened february  focus on loan growth impact on net interest margin the corporation  through the bank  continued to focus in on the growth of its loan portfolio in all of its market areas  resulting in a net increase in the loan portfolio of million during a significant portion of the new loans recorded in were variable rate loans  as opposed to longer term fixed rate loans  thereby reducing the bank s exposure to reduced earnings in a rising interest rate environment 
the low level of interest rates throughout resulted in these new variable rate loans being recorded initially at low rates 
however  as the bank is asset sensitive at the end of  rising interest rates will result in these loans re pricing at higher rates in future periods 
while the impact of the low interest rate environment and the corporation s strategic focus on its asset sensitive position negatively impacted net interest income by million  the growth in loans positively impacted the increase in net interest income by million 
this resulted in an overall increase in net interest income of million on a fully taxable equivalent basis as shown in table the bank funded only a portion of its loan growth from deposits generated in its local market areas and relied on the purchase of brokered certificates of deposits  which are generally at higher fixed rates  to fund the remainder of loan growth 
while the dollar amount of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased by million in  the reliance on higher rate deposits  coupled with the lower initial rates on new adjustable rate loans  resulted in a compression of the net interest margin from in to in loan quality and the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses at december  of million exceeds by four times the amount of net loan charge offs during the allowance was 
of year end loans and times total non accrual loans at year end  compared to 
and times at december   respectively 
the provision for loan losses increased to million in from 
million in this increase was necessitated in response to the significant increase of loans in the loan portfolio as well as to provide for specific losses approximately 
million on two commercial loans 
management has analyzed the allowance for loan losses as of december  and concluded that the allowance is adequate 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income in increased by million over driven primarily by increases in service charge income from deposit products  trust income and insurance premium income 
excluding the aforementioned million of expenses related to the early redemption of long term fhlb advances and junior subordinated debentures  operating expenses increased by million when compared to salaries and benefits expense also increased in by approximately million  reflecting general salary increases  staffing additions in key areas  and a full year of compensation costs related to the huntington branches acquired in mid the corporation also incurred additional professional fees in related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  and additional costs for conversion of its network lines associated with branch expansion and modernization 
dividends despite the reduced level of earnings in  the corporation maintained and increased its dividend to shareholders 
dividends increased to per share in  a increase from per share in the corporation has paid cash dividends consistently since  the year in which the holding company was formed 
the corporation will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in its core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products by existing competitors and potential new entrants in its markets  changes in interest rates  and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these risk factors  see exhibit risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the corporation s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the most critical accounting policy applied by the corporation is that related to the valuation of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with the specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  change in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed in the allowance and provision for loan losses section of this management s discussion and analysis and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
the corporation has million of core deposit intangible assets which are subject to amortization and million in goodwill primarily related to the huntington branch acquisition  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the corporation s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon the corporation s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of the corporation s services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
the corporation has concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as a result of the evaluation 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
recent developments management expects to liquidate oakfirst life by transferring substantially all of its assets to the corporation during the second quarter of currently  credit life and credit accident and health insurance are offered to the corporation s borrowers through  and are underwritten in part by  oakfirst life 
because of recent changes in federal tax law  the income generated by oakfirst life from this line of business is no longer exempt from federal income tax  which has been one of the significant benefits of offering these products through oakfirst life 
moreover  because the corporation s lending operations have shifted away from direct automobile loans in recent periods  the corporation is recognizing smaller underwriting profits from the sale of these insurance products 
in light of the foregoing  management believes that it would be more beneficial to the corporation if these insurance products were offered on a commission only basis through the corporation s licensed insurance agents rather than through oakfirst life 
management does not expect the liquidation or the shift in strategy to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is the largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the years dollars in thousands 
interest income    interest expense    net interest income    net interest margin net interest income increased million in when compared to  due primarily to the increase in interest income of million  offset by a slight increase in interest expense of 
million 
as reflected in the income statement  interest income from loans increased by million  due to the million increase in the average balance of loans in  offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans 
during  the bank implemented a loan pricing model  that is being used to set pricing for mortgage  commercial and consumer loan products throughout the bank  and ensures loan pricing is consistent with targeted net interest margins 
the increase in total interest expense in was due to the decline in interest expense on deposits of 
million offset by increased interest expense on borrowings of million 
interest expense on deposits declined primarily due to the basis point decrease in the average yield on time deposits less than  the increase in interest expense or borrowings was primarily due to the million increase in the average balance of short term borrowings coupled with the basis point increase in average yield on these borrowings 
net interest income increased million in when compared to due primarily to a reduction in interest expense 
interest income was virtually unchanged as the increase in average interest earning assets of million in over  was offset by a basis point decline in yield on such earning assets 
although interest bearing liabilities increased million in over  a decrease in the effective rate of these interest bearing liabilities of basis points resulted in a net decrease in interest expense of million 
the composition of interest income on loans has increased with the increase in loans as a percentage of interest earning assets

the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of its loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the and type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate  and to a lesser extent  by equipment and vehicles unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding an internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
the corporation will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting the underwriting standards of the corporation

during  efforts were made to increase the percentage of loans in the portfolio with adjustable interest rates 
at year end  adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at year end commercial loans increased in  following a increase in new commercial loans in are attributable to focused efforts by the corporation s lenders to identify new customer opportunities  as well as to expand existing customer relationships in all of its market areas  while maintaining existing standards of credit worthiness 
additionally  most new commercial loans were priced on a variable rate basis  resetting monthly  and were very popular with business borrowers 
commercial loans secured by real estate were at the end of  compared to in residential mortgage loans increased by million or in when compared to this follows a increase in over this increase is attributable to management s continued emphasis on increasing its mortgage loan portfolio in its key market areas  and through the use of adjustable rate mortgage products that have been well received by borrowers in these market areas 
consumer installment loans in decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease reflects management s shift toward more commercial and mortgage loans  and less emphasis on the highly competitive consumer loan market 
specifically  less focus was placed on generating new indirect auto loans during indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of installment loans  at the end of and at the end of during  gross loans increased million over to million 
approximately two thirds of this loan growth was derived through the corporation s existing customer base  and the remaining one third was attributable to the huntington branch acquisition 
the key contributors to this strong loan growth in were commercial million  residential mortgage million and installment million 
the commercial portfolio grew in  following a increase in approximately one half of this growth in resulted from the huntington branch acquisition 
the other one half is primarily attributable to additional business with existing customer relationships and a more aggressive pricing strategy  while maintaining strong credit worthiness standards 
residential mortgage loans grew in after decreasing by in approximately one third of the growth in resulted from the huntington branch acquisition 
the remaining two thirds is attributable to a combination of an aggressive marketing campaign to solicit and retain existing mortgage customers  as well as offering a competitive adjustable rate mortgage as an alternative to the fixed rates offered in the secondary market 
consumer installment loans grew in following a increase in this increase relates primarily to an increase in the indirect automobile loan portfolio  resulting from an expansion of the corporation s dealer network within its market area and a more aggressive pricing strategy

management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due

million during and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans and leases 
the corporation utilizes the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by information obtained from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for those loans on the watchlist in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured  for the small business administration and farm service agency guaranteed portion of loans  or for loans that are sufficiently collateralized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at year end  from million at year end several factors contributed to the 
million increase in the balance of the allowance  including an increase in the total loan portfolio of million during the year  a slight increase in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans to 
in from 
in  caused primarily by a higher level of commercial loan charge offs  offset by reduced installment loan charge offs  and a specific allocation of 
million related to three commercial loans that are on non accrual status  based on a thorough analysis of the related collateral securing these loans 
the balance of the allowance at the end of is equal to 
of total loans  and is equal to four times net loan charge offs for the year 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology outlined above  management has concluded that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december  although the balance of total loans increased million in  including million associated with the huntington branch acquisition with an adjustment to the allowance for these loans of 
million  the corporation s overall net charge off experience relative to total average loans outstanding has declined to

in net charge offs relating to the installment loan portfolio represent approximately and of total net charge offs for and  respectively 
generally  installment loans are charged off after they are days contractually past due 
the allowance allocated to the installment loan portfolio at december  remains more than twice the current year s net charge offs 
additionally  based upon its periodic reevaluation of the collateral for a large commercial loan that was in non accrual status  the corporation determined that it was in a secure position relative to the loan balance  resulting in a 
million specific allocation for that loan facility being removed from the allowance 
as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  the allowance for loan losses was considered adequate at million at december  table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years

on an average balance basis  all deposit categories increased when compared to  except for time deposits of less than  approximately of the year end balance increase and one half of the average balance increase is attributed to deposits the corporation received as part of the huntington branch acquisition 
the remaining increase is primarily attributed to the full year impact of a new interest bearing demand deposit product which was introduced in the spring of that offers customers liquidity as well as a competitive rate

at december   the corporation had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million and an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details about the corporation s borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier ii capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier i ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratio for year end was 
the decrease in was a direct result of the increase in assets and goodwill attributable to the huntington branch acquisition 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios 
total shareholders equity increased million to million at december   from million at year end the return on average equity roe for declined to from for return on average equity roe for was 
the decrease in roe in is due to the decrease in net income in of million when compared to cash dividends of

liquidity the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain sufficient funds to satisfy the needs of depositors and borrowers 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds and investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
at december   such liquid assets totaled million 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions  and the corporation s ability to renew maturing deposits 
the corporation s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
when appropriate  the corporation takes advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable the corporation to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   the corporation had available borrowing capacity of approximately million through the fhlb and other financial institutions 
the corporation actively manages its liquidity position under the direction of the asset and liability management committee of the corporation 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by this board committee under prescribed policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the corporation will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
management believes that the corporation has adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands 
for information about the corporation s borrowings  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to service its junior subordinated debt 
the main sources of funding for the holding company include dividends from the bank and access to the capital markets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the bank is subject to significant regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the holding company 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million 
as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the bank could have paid to the holding company without regulatory approval was million 
interest rate sensitivity the corporation s primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
management has not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that the corporation becomes liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is liability sensitive there is a negative impact to net interest income when interest rates increase 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  the corporation estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase  basis point increase basis point decrease   this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future funding requirements
