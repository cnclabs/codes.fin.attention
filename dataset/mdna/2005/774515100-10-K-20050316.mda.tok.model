additionally  the company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the result of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
inflation the company s financial performance is influenced by factors such as higher raw material costs as well as higher salaries and employee benefits 
management attempts to minimize or offset the effects of inflation through increased selling prices  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
the company was able to mitigate the effects of inflation during due to these factors

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management regularly reviews its accounting policies to make certain they are current and also provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
these include  but are not limited to  matters related to accounts receivable  inventories  pension benefits  and income taxes 
implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable 
this may include judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition customer sales are recognized when revenue is realized and earned 
the company recognizes revenue when the risk and title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management also records estimates for customer returns and discounts offered to customers 
should a greater proportion of customers return goods and take advantage of discounts than estimated by the company  additional allowances may be required 
sales returns and allowances revenue principally consists of sales to customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to customers  while license fees are recognized when earned 
the company records a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances 
these reductions are influenced by historical experience  based on customer returns and allowances 
the actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may differ from the company s estimates 
if the company determines that sales returns or allowances should be either increased or decreased  then the adjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company s inventories are considered saleable and the company has been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories through the company s factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers 
should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow moving or obsolete inventories  additional provisions may be necessary 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of its inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required 
intangible assets the company had million of intangible assets at december  goodwill  trademarks and patents are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values 
fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows 
based on this testing  none of our goodwill  trademarks or patents were impaired as of december  pension benefits accounting for pensions involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  retirement plans  of this form k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 
pension expenses are determined by actuaries using assumptions concerning the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
an actuarial analysis of benefit obligations and plan assets is determined as of september each year 
the funded status of the company s plans and reconciliation of accrued pension cost is determined annually as of december further discussion of the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in note retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k 
actual results would be different using other assumptions 
management records an accrual for pension costs associated with the company sponsored noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering non union workers of the company 
a union plan  which was frozen in  was settled in april future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying plan assets could result in losses or a higher accrual 
income taxes currently  management has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
finally  at december   a provision of  has been made for us taxes on the repatriation of  of accumulated undistributed earnings of five star through december  at december   after the planned repatriation above  approximately  is remaining that would become taxable upon repatriation to the united states 
during  the company will complete its evaluation of foreign earnings and may repatriate up to an additional  of accumulated undistributed earnings  which could result in up to  of additional tax
