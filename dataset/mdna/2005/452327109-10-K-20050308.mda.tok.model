our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in factors affecting operating results below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview illumina  inc was incorporated in april we develop and market next generation tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine  a key goal of genomics 
using our technologies  we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics 
this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states  enhancing drug discovery  allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically  and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 
in  we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna  or oligos  manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology 
we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies  which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins 
in  we also initiated our snp genotyping services product line 
as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput  low cost beadarray technology  we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many leading genotyping centers  and have been awarded million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the first phase of the international hapmap project 

table of contents our production scale beadlab is based on the system we developed that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since in addition to our sentrix array matrices  it includes the beadarray reader  a proprietary scanner that uses a laser to read the results of experiments captured on our arrays  as well as the goldengate snp genotyping assay which can analyze up to snps per dna sample 
this system is being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users 
as of january   we have installed and recorded revenue for nine beadlabs 
in  we announced the launch of several new products  including a new array format  the sentrix beadchip  which significantly expands market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers  a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to samples on a single array  and a benchtop snp genotyping and gene expression system  the beadstation  for performing moderate scale genotyping and gene expression using our technology 
the beadstation includes our beadarray reader  analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs 
sales of these products began in the first quarter of and  as of january   we have shipped beadstations 
in  we announced the launch of new sentrix beadchips for whole genome gene expression and whole genome genotyping 
the whole genome gene expression beadchips are designed to enable high performance  cost effective  whole genome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip  resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of whole genome expression analysis while allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of large scale biological experimentation 
the whole genome genotyping beadchip can be scaled to unlimited levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and will provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of thousands of snps in parallel 
in  we also announced two new versions of the sentrix array matrix designed for researchers who want to take advantage of our technology  but whose projects require fewer snps per sample than the number utilized on our standard plex array products 
in late  we announced a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation to synthesize and distribute oligos 
under the agreement  we intend to expand our oligator dna synthesis technology to include both plate and tube based capability and invitrogen will be responsible for sales  marketing and technical support 
profits from sales of collaboration products will be divided equally between the two companies 
in early  we expanded our gene expression portfolio by announcing the launch of a new assay  dasl  for generating gene expression profiles from rna samples including those containing partially degraded rnas 
we also announced a standard dasl cancer panel 
prior to our dasl assay  degraded rna samples have been reliably assayed only with expensive  low multiplex approaches 
in february  we signed a definitive agreement and plan of merger with cyvera corporation  a privately held connecticut based company  pursuant to which cyvera will become a wholly owned subsidiary of illumina 
cyvera s digital microbead platform is highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services and upon closing of the transaction  will become an integral part of our beadarray technology 
the acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to bead based assays for biomarker r d and in vitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities  including those that require low complexity as well as high complexity testing 
the aggregate consideration for the transaction is million  consisting of approximately million shares of illumina common stock and the payment of approximately million of cyvera s liabilities at the closing 
the closing is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to occur by the end of march we expect the first products based on cyvera s technology to be available in the second half in we are seeking to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology  however  we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful 

table of contents our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products and service projects  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and amount of government grant funding programs  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns 
approximately of our revenues for the year resulted from transactions that were funded under the international hapmap project 
we currently expect that most of the activities under this grant involving the company and its customers will be completed in early we expect that the planned commercial launch of our whole genome genotyping and gene expression arrays  combined with the continued expansion of our existing product lines  will offset the loss of revenues funded by the hapmap grant and will drive future revenue growth 
however  any significant delays in the commercial launch of these new products  unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth in or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss  we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
as of january   our accumulated deficit was million  and total stockholders equity was million 
these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services  as well as charges of million related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research  development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years 
we will also need to significantly increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
as a result of the expected increase in expenses  we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability 
critical accounting estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates  assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical if they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  or different estimates that we reasonably could have used  would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our sales are primarily from two sources product revenue and services revenue 
product revenue consists of sales of oligonucleotides  arrays  assay reagents  genotyping systems and gene expression systems 
services revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services and extended warranty sales 
as described below  significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under sab  revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier or when the customer receives the product  depending on the nature of the arrangement and provided no significant obligations remain 
beadlabs are considered delivered upon shipment  installation  training and fulfillment of contractually defined acceptance criteria and we need to determine the completion of each of these deliverables before revenue can be recognized 
genotyping services are considered delivered generally at the time the genotyping data is delivered to the customer 
we have been awarded million from the national institutes of health to perform genotyping services in connection with the first phase of the international hapmap project 
a portion of the services related to this project is considered delivered at the time the related costs are incurred while the remainder is considered delivered upon the delivery of genotyping data 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable  we ensure there are no refund rights 
if payment terms are based on future performance  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
changes in judgments and estimates made in determining whether the criteria of sab have been met might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 
sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems include a standard one year warranty 
we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts  which are generally for one or two years  upon the expiration of the initial warranty 
revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty 
reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we believe the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

table of contents a third source of revenue  research revenue  consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
all revenues are recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
currently we have no such reserves recorded 
any reserves recorded in the future may change due to new developments in each matter 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
this statement supercedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we currently utilize the black scholes model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees under the pro forma disclosure requirements of fas while sfas r permits companies to continue to use such model  it also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options under the adoption for sfas r 
the new standard is effective for periods beginning after june   and we expect to adopt sfas r on july  
table of contents we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to result in significant non cash charges which will increase our reported operating expenses  however  it will have no impact on our cash flows 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future and the model we choose to use 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss under stock based compensation in note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended january   december  and december  stated as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended year ended year ended january  december  december  revenue product revenue service revenue research revenue total revenue costs and expenses cost of product revenue cost of service revenue research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred compensation and other non cash compensation charges litigation judgment settlement  net total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income interest and other expense net loss comparison of years ended january  and december  our fiscal year is or weeks ending the sunday closest to december  with quarters of or weeks ending the sunday closest to march  june  and september the years ended january  and december  are and weeks  respectively 

table of contents revenue year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands product revenue service revenue research revenue total revenue revenue for the years ended january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
product revenue increased to million in from million in the increase resulted almost entirely from sales of consumables used on our beadlabs and beadstations and sales of our benchtop beadstations  offset by fewer sales of our production scale beadlabs 
in  we had no sales of beadstations and we only began selling consumable products in may service revenue increased to million in from million in substantially all of this increase relates to snp genotyping services performed for the international hapmap project 
we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the first phase of the international hapmap project  which is a million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform disease related research 
we could receive up to million of funding for this project which covers basic research activities  the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays 
we have recognized revenue under this grant of million and  as of the end of  we had approximately million of funding remaining related to this project which is expected to be received in early government grants and other research funding decreased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in internal research spending for our grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the international hapmap project 
we expect government grants to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
to expand revenue in the future  we have recently launched a series of new products that we expect to begin selling in these include a new assay  dasl  for generating gene expression profiles from rna samples including those containing partially degraded rnas  two multi sample whole genome gene expression beadchips and a whole genome genotyping beadchip 
our beadlabs address a limited number of potential high throughput genotyping customers  and sales of these systems may decline in versus in addition  approximately of our revenues for the year resulted from transactions that were funded under the international hapmap project 
we expect that most of the activities under this grant involving us and our customers will be completed in early and that revenue related to this project will decline in versus we expect the sales of the new products mentioned above  combined with increased sales of beadstations and revenue generated from our collaboration with invitrogen  to offset such declines and for overall revenues to increase above levels  however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these sales efforts 

table of contents cost of product and service revenue year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service revenue cost of product and service revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  packaging and delivery cost 
costs related to research revenue is included in research and development expense 
cost of product revenue increased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales of our beadstations and consumables 
gross margin on product revenue increased to in the year ended january   from for the year ended december   due primarily to increased sales of higher margin consumable products  as well as efficiencies gained in oligo manufacturing 
cost of service revenue decreased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  and gross margin on service revenue increased to in the year ended january   from for the year ended december  this decrease in cost and increase in gross margin is due primarily to efficiencies gained in snp genotyping services  as well as lower costs of oligos used in the genotyping services process 
we expect product mix will continue to affect our future gross margins  and any increase in the proportion of consumable sales to total sales will continue to favorably affect our gross margins 
however  we expect our market will become increasingly price competitive  and over the longer term  our margins may decline 
research and development expenses year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the decrease is attributable to personnel related expenses and related lab supplies and the majority of the remaining million is attributable to lower manufacturing related resources needed to support research efforts and a decrease in depreciation expense 
during the year ended january   the cost of beadarray technology research activities decreased million as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of completing the development of several products that were commercially launched in late and such as our beadstation and focused gene set array products 
research to support our oligator technology platform decreased million in the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we implemented additional oligator manufacturing and software enhancements to expand capacity  increase throughput  and further reduce operating costs 
in addition  as we increase our product sales  a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources are now used to support research efforts as compared to the same periods in 
table of contents we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the near term due to the allocation to research and development of rent expense from the new lease on our building and increased spending levels for new product development 
in addition  we expect an increase in research and development expenses in connection with our proposed acquisition of cyvera corporation  which is expected to close in march stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is due to higher sales and marketing costs  of which million is attributable to personnel related expenses and million is attributable to an increase in facility related expenses 
approximately million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is related to general and administrative costs  of which million is related to personnel related expenses  and the majority of the remaining million is attributable to expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and our international expansion 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure  incur additional costs to support the commercialization and support of an increasing number of products  and due to the allocation to selling  general and administrative of rent expense from the new lease on our building 
stock based compensation related to selling  general and administrative employees  directors and consultants was million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges from our inception through july   in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees  founders and directors  we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million  representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold 
we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options 

table of contents we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees  founders and directors  using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for consultants  deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and is periodically re measured and expensed in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million and million for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
we expect expenses related to stock based compensation to increase significantly beginning in the third quarter of as we implement the requirements of sfas r 
although the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to result in a significant increase in our reported operating expenses  it will have no impact on our cash flows 
sfas r is discussed further in recently issued accounting standards above and note to our consolidated financial statements 
litigation judgment settlement  net year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands litigation judgment settlement  net a million charge was recorded in june to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict in a termination of employment lawsuit 
we appealed the decision  and in december  the fourth appellate district court of appeal  in san diego  california  reduced the amount of the award 
during the appeal process  the court required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case was resolved 
for the years ended january  and december  we recorded million and million  respectively  as litigation expense for such interest charges 
as a result of the revised judgment  we reduced the million liability on our balance sheet to million and recorded a gain of million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter of in  we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems group  an operating group of applera corporation  under which the companies agreed to jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems assay chemistry and scanner technology 
in conjunction with the agreement  applied biosystems agreed to provide us with non refundable research and development support of million  all of which was provided by december as of december   this amount was recorded on our balance sheet as an advance payment from a former collaborator 
in december  applied biosystems initiated a patent infringement suit and sought to compel arbitration of an alleged breach of the joint development agreement 
we initiated a suit in state court seeking to enjoin the arbitration and alleged that applied biosystems had breached the joint development agreement 
in august  we entered into a settlement and cross license agreement with applera 
as a result of the settlement  we removed the million liability from our balance sheet  made a payment of million to applera and recorded a gain of million as a litigation settlement 
interest income year ended year ended january  december  change in thousands interest income 
table of contents interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
the decrease is due to lower effective interest rates  partially offset by higher average cash balances

in the year ended january   we recorded approximately  in losses due to foreign currency transactions as compared to approximately  in gains  for the year ended december  estimated foreign income taxes were approximately  and  for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended january  and december   and accordingly  we did not pay any us federal or state income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
as of january   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  and similar state provisions  as a result of changes in our ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization

as of january   we had funding remaining under existing nih grants of approximately million  including million available under the international hapmap project 
all of these amounts are expected to be paid in  subject to the actual amount of activities we perform under these grants 
based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents  investments  revenues from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least months 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the current time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping and gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to expand our oligonucleotide and snp genotyping services product lines  scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with affymetrix  the success of our collaboration with invitrogen and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
therefore  we may require additional funding within this month time frame 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations  such as an acquisition  even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights 
in december   we filed a shelf registration statement that would allow us to raise up to million of funding through the sale of common stock in one or more transactions 
in may  we raised approximately million  net of offering expenses  through the sale of our common stock under this shelf registration statement 
we currently do not have plans to raise additional funds under this registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any spe transactions 

table of contents in january  we purchased two newly constructed buildings and assumed a million  year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 
in june  we entered into a conditional agreement to sell our land and buildings for million and to lease back such property for an initial term of ten years 
the sale was completed in august at which time the lease was signed 
after the repayment of the remaining million debt and other related transaction expenses  we received million in net cash proceeds 
we removed the land and net book value of the buildings of million from our balance sheet and are recording the resulting million gain on the sale of the property over the ten year lease term in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
under the terms of the lease  we made a million security deposit and are paying monthly rent of  for the first year with an annual increase of in each subsequent year 
we also lease office space under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various times through january these leases contain renewal options ranging from to years 
as of january   our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations are in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years operating leases total the above table does not include orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 
factors affecting our operating results our business is subject to various risks  including those described below 
in addition to the other information included in this form k  the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

table of contents litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services 
our commercial success depends in part on our non infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property 
while we recently settled our litigation with applera corporation s applied biosystems group in august  affymetrix filed a complaint against us in july  alleging infringement of six of its patents  and other third parties have or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
as we enter new markets  we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets 
in addition  third parties have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents 
we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims 
we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief  which effectively could block our ability to further develop  commercialize and sell products  and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties  or be prohibited from selling certain products 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in that event  we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products  and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability 
we expect intense competition in our target markets  which could render our products obsolete  result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 
this would limit our ability to compete and achieve profitability 
if we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products  our revenues may not grow as intended 
we compete with life sciences companies that design  manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as two dimensional electrophoresis  capillary electrophoresis  mass spectrometry  flow cytometry  microfluidics  and mechanically deposited  inkjet and photolithographic arrays 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition  new product introductions and strong price competition 
for example  affymetrix recently released a k snp genotyping chip and has announced a k chip which will compete with our snp genotyping service and product offerings and several competitors have begun selling a single chip for whole human genome expression which may compete with our gene expression product offerings 
one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical 
our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources  broader product lines  a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we have 
furthermore  the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies  which are our potential customers and strategic partners  could develop competing products 
if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

table of contents we have generated only moderate amounts of revenue from product and service offerings to date 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses at least through early at january  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  and we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended january  the magnitude of our net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  of our revenue and on the level of our expenses 
we expect to continue incurring significant expenses for research and development  for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products 
in addition  we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the launch of new products 
as a result  we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and  consequently  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable products  and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and relatively unproven technologies 
we may not possess all of the resources  capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies 
sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began in  and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development 
you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries 
we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale and we currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors 
we may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner  or at all  or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace 
problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services 
in addition  we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services 
historically  life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies 
in order to be successful  our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the benefits and cost effectiveness of our products and services relative to others available in the market  the extent and effectiveness of our efforts to market  sell and distribute our products  our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and reliability and at an acceptable cost  and the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies requiring capital investments 

table of contents any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries 
if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately  competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad 
these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 
the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries  including our patent position  generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products  as we deem appropriate 
however  our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
also  our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  or litigate against third party claims  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace 
we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information 
these measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
we have limited experience in manufacturing commercial products 
we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales 
we have only recently begun manufacturing products on a commercial scale and  in the past  we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields 
due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna  we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields  impact our ability to launch or sell these products  or to produce them economically  may prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

table of contents our sales  marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 
we currently have fewer resources available for sales and marketing and technical support services as compared to our primary competitors and have only recently established a small direct sales force and customer support team 
in order to effectively commercialize our genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow  we will need to expand our sales  marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services 
in addition  we compete primarily with much larger companies  that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place  and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 
if we are unable to develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability  we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner  or at all 
we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use 
if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail  these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services 
if we are unable to find third party manufacturers to manufacture components of our products  we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner  or at all 
the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources 
for example  we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and beadchip slides included in our products from single vendors 
if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components  we will be unable to meet demand for our products 
we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial scale production of some of our products  or develop these capabilities internally  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis  for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms 
accordingly  we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 
we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth 
these difficulties could increase our losses 
we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans  which will place a strain on our human and capital resources 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our losses could increase 
our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees 
if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner  or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls  then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology 
failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

table of contents we may need additional capital in the future 
if additional capital is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services  the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business  the progress and scope of our research and development projects  the filing  prosecution and enforcement of patent claims  the outcome of our legal proceedings with affymetrix and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for at least months 
however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
consequently  we may need additional funding within this timeframe 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations  such as an acquisition  even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital available as of january  to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to achieve our goals 
we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel  including jay flatley  our president and chief executive officer  david barker  our vice president and chief scientific officer  and john stuelpnagel  our senior vice president and chief operating officer 
the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives 
in addition  timothy kish  our chief financial officer  has informed us of his intention to resign in the second quarter of mr 
kish continues in his role as chief financial officer  and we are currently conducting a search for his successor 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology  chemistry  biological information processing  sales  marketing and technical support 
we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies  universities and research institutions  particularly those focusing on genomics 
competition for these individuals  particularly in the san diego area  is intense  and the turnover rate can be high 
failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 
our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies  including the life sciences and healthcare industries 
thus  we will need to add new personnel  including management  and develop the expertise of existing management 
the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

table of contents we may encounter difficulties in integrating future acquisitions and that could adversely affect our business 
we have recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire cyvera corporation and may in the future acquire technology  products or businesses related to our current or future business 
our acquisition of cyvera is expected to close in march  however  the closing is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions  and we cannot assure you this transaction will close in this timeframe or at all 
we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions 
further  these potential acquisitions entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate a company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
in connection with the cyvera acquisition  we will assume certain liabilities and hire certain employees of cyvera  which is expected to result in an increase in research and development expenses 
there may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our sales are to international customers 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended january  were derived from customers outside the united states 
we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of non us sales to continue to grow 
export sales entail a variety of risks  including currency exchange fluctuations  unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we import our products  difficulties in obtaining export licenses or other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays  and significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in addition  sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political  social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success depends upon the increasing availability of genetic information and the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and function 
we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries 
the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease 
we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function  namely snp genotyping and gene expression profiling 
both of these markets are new and emerging  and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate  or reach their full potential 
other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing 
also  researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function 
if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner  demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect  and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

table of contents we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate 
this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products and services projects  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and amount of government grant funding programs  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns 
given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services  we may experience quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly 
accordingly  if revenue does not grow as anticipated  we may not be able to reduce our operating losses 
approximately of our revenues for the year resulted from transactions that were funded under the international hapmap project 
we currently expect that most of the activities under this grant involving the company and its customers will be completed in early although we expect that the loss of revenues resulting from the completion of the hapmap grant may be offset by the planned commercial launch of our whole genome genotyping and gene expression arrays  combined with the continued expansion of our existing product lines  any significant delays in the commercial launch of these products  unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth in or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  our stock price probably would decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars  some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
accordingly  the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 

table of contents exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations 
in july  we began hedging significant foreign currency firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction 
the notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at january  was approximately million 
these contracts had a fair value of approximately million  representing an unrealized loss  and were included in other current liabilities at january  as of january   all contracts were set to expire at various times through july  and are with reputable bank institutions 
for the year ended january   there were no amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness and we settled foreign exchange contracts of approximately million 
we have hedged all significant firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies  and as a result  any increase or decrease in the exchange rates of these commitments would have no net effect to our balance sheet or our results of operations
