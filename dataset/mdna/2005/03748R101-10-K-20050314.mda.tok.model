item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  engaged in the ownership  acquisition  management and redevelopment of apartment properties 
our property operations are characterized by diversification of product  location and price point 
as of december   we owned or managed  apartment properties containing  units located in states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases 
the key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are funds from operations  or ffo  ffo less spending for capital replacements  or affo  same store property operating results  net operating income  net operating income less spending for capital replacements  financial coverage ratios  and leverage as shown on our balance sheet 
these terms are defined and described in the sections captioned funds from operations and capital expenditures below 
the key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are rates of job growth  unemployment rates  single family and multifamily housing starts  and interest rates 
because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties  the supply and demand for apartments substantially influences our results 
additionally  the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop  acquire and dispose of our apartment properties can affect our operating results 
our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings 
we have grown rapidly over the past decade  and during the past three years our growth has moderated 
during  the apartment industry continued to face a challenging operating environment job growth at a pace slower than anticipated  low interest rates and an abundant supply of housing alternatives 
in addition  we experienced greater difficulty as compared to our peers because our property operating systems and structure were not as effective in meeting the challenges presented by the apartment markets 
the effect of these operational challenges was mitigated by a favorable investment climate in which we were able to sell properties at attractive prices  generally higher than the cost of replacement 
in response to this challenging operating environment and our specific operational issues  during late and throughout we adjusted our business strategies to compete successfully in challenging times and to be ready to maximize our opportunities as the economy improves 
we focused on a number of areas related to improving operations  including those related to customer service  resident selection and retention  marketing  pricing  and operating cost management 
our resident selection initiatives designed to make our communities more desirable places to live and work  which drives better financial performance from higher and more stable occupancy levels  increased pricing power and reduced costs 
in combination  our initiatives are resulting in improved customer service  better pricing decisions  increased resident quality  a focus on sales and marketing and higher employee satisfaction 
our revenue building initiatives are largely completed with processes in place for continued improvement in resident quality  pricing  sales and marketing 
our focus in will be to continue to increase revenue and work on cost management and productivity initiatives including centralizing purchasing  restructuring business processes  using technology to increase efficiency and implementing structured monthly reporting to identify issues and improve effectiveness of spending 
we believe that our improvement efforts are working and have resulted in a positive trend in certain operating results and are the foundation for long term benefits that we began to realize in the second half of and expect to continue throughout and beyond 
these initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality  and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements 

table of contents results of operations overview compared to we recognized net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were principally due to the following items  all of which are discussed in further detail within this section an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain related to unconsolidated entities and other  and an increase in activity fees and asset management revenues 
these increases were partially offset by an overall decline in net operating income  which included increases related to acquisitions and newly consolidated properties  offset by a decline in same store net operating results  an increase in general and administrative expenses  an increase in interest expense  and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
the following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting our results of operations in more detail 
compared to we recognized net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   decreases of million and million  respectively 
these decreases were principally due to the following items  all of which are discussed in further detail within this section an overall decline in net operating income  which included increases related to acquisitions and newly consolidated properties  offset by a decline in same store net operating results  an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses  an increase in interest expense  a decrease in interest income  and a decrease in property management revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain relating to unconsolidated entities  and lower minority interest allocations as a result of lower property operating results 
rental property operations our operating income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties 
the principal components within our total consolidated property operations are consolidated same store properties  which consist of all conventional properties that were owned  stabilized and consolidated for all comparable periods presented  and other consolidated entities  which include acquisition  newly consolidated  affordable and redevelopment properties 

table of contents the following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  rental and other property revenues property operating expenses net operating income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income for our consolidated property operations decreased by million  or 
this decrease was principally due to a million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results 
additionally  there was a million decrease related to net casualty losses and other costs primarily resulting from hurricanes and tropical storms in the third quarter of  which damaged over of our properties and million in higher property management costs 
these decreases were offset by an million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties  which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method properties first consolidated in  which includes properties that were consolidated due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  and properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of and a million increase related to operations of acquisition properties  which were principally comprised of the palazzo at park la brea and other properties purchased in  and three properties purchased in for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by million  or 
this increase was principally due to million related to operations of newly consolidated properties properties first consolidated in and properties first consolidated in and million related to operations of acquisition properties  which were principally comprised of three properties purchased in  properties acquired in the march acquisition of casden properties  inc  properties acquired in the august acquisition of new england area properties  and two properties purchased in this was partially offset by a million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results 
conventional same store property operating results same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties 
we define same store properties as conventional properties in which our ownership interest exceeds and the operations of which are stabilized for all periods presented 
to ensure comparability  the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership 
the following table summarizes the conventional rental property operations on a same store basis which is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
table of contents and reconciles them to consolidated rental property operations which is in accordance with gaap described in the above comparative discussions dollars in thousands year ended december  our share of same store revenues our share of same store expenses our share of same store net operating income adjustments to reconcile same store net operating income to real estate segment net operating income real estate segment net operating income same store statistics for three year period properties apartment units average physical occupancy average rent unit month includes i minority partners share of consolidated  less our share of unconsolidated  property revenues and property operating expenses at current period ownership  ii property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties eg  affordable  acquisition and redevelopment properties  and iii eliminations and other adjustments made in accordance with gaap 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   our share of same store net operating income decreased million  or 
revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower occupancy down  and slightly lower average rent down per unit  offset by higher utility reimbursements from residents and lower bad debt expense 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefit expense related to a new employee health plan  merit increases and increased staffing levels  an increase of million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas  and an increase of million in marketing and administrative expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in property taxes related to successful appeals and changes in estimates related to assessments 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   our share of same store net operating income decreased million  or 
revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower average rent down per unit  lower occupancy down  and increased bad debt 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in turnover  marketing and administrative costs in related to focused efforts to improve property appearance and the condition of units ready to be occupied  million in contract services and repairs and maintenance primarily driven by seasonal factors such as landscaping and snow removal due to more severe winter conditions in than in  million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas  electric  water and sewer  and million in property hazard insurance due to increased casualty losses 
property management we earn income from property management primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner 
the income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property management and other associated activities 
our revenue from property management decreases as we consolidate real estate partnerships and the income generated is therefore eliminated in consolidation 
we expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by gaap 
additionally  our revenue decreases as properties within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships are sold 
offsetting the revenue earned in property management are the direct expenses associated with property management 

table of contents the following table summarizes the overall performance of our property management business for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  property management revenues  primarily from affiliates property management expenses net operating income from property management for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from property management decreased by million  or 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from property management decreased by million  or 
in both periods the decreases were principally due to an increase in consolidated real estate partnerships  which required elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such partnerships  and the sales of properties within our unconsolidated partnerships properties in and properties in that had previously generated property management revenues 
activity fees and asset management activity fees are generated from transactional activity including dispositions  syndications  tax credit redevelopments and refinancings 
these transactions occur on varying timetables  thus the income generated may vary from period to period 
the majority of these fees are generated by transactions related to affordable properties within the aimco capital portfolio 
asset management revenue is from the financial management of properties  rather than management of day to day property operations 
asset management revenue includes deferred asset management fees that are recognized once a transaction or improvement in operations has occurred to generate available cash 
offsetting the revenue earned in activity fees and asset management are the direct expenses associated with these activities 
the following table summarizes the overall performance of our activity fees and asset management for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  activity fees and asset management revenues  primarily from affiliates activity and asset management expenses net operating income from activity fees and asset management included in the activity fees and asset management revenues  primarily from affiliates for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively  of fees related to affordable properties within the aimco capital portfolio 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased by million  or 
this overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to disposition  refinancing and developer activities of million  million and million  respectively  due to a greater number of transactions in than in additionally  there was an increase of million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from closed transactions and improved operations 
these increases were offset by a million decrease related to syndication fees and million in higher expenses associated with these activities 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from activity fees and asset management decreased by million 
this overall decrease was principally a result of decreased activity fees related to disposition and refinancing activities of million and million  respectively  due to a fewer number of transactions in than in additionally  there was a decrease of million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from fewer closed 
table of contents transactions in these decreases were offset by a million increase related to syndication fees and lower expenses of million associated with these activities 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional depreciation related to the newly consolidated and acquisition properties  respectively  as well as million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties 
additionally  million of the increase resulted from additional depreciation on certain assets where  based on a periodic review  the estimated useful lives were reduced 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional depreciation related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties  respectively  as well as million of additional depreciation related to new capital spending on same store properties 
additionally  amortization of intangibles increased million as a result of additional amortization recognized due to the termination of certain management contracts acquired in the casden transactions 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels  merit increases and variable compensation  million related to increased health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in related to our accrual for insurance claims incurred but not reported ibnr  million in increased amortization of restricted stock and stock option compensation  and million in legal costs and compliance costs primarily related to the internal control reporting requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat decreasing million  or 
this decrease was principally due to million related to lower health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in our ibnr accrual in  and million in lower salaries  primarily related to lower variable compensation 
these decreases were offset by an million increase in consulting fees associated with the implementation of site level software and legal fees 
other expenses income  net other expenses income  net includes tax provision benefit  franchise taxes  risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   other expenses income  net changed million from income of million in to expense of million in this change was principally due to a million lower tax benefit recognized in as compared to  due primarily to an million benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance see further discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
in the year ended december   there was a tax benefit of million recorded  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   other expenses income  net changed million from expense of million in to income of million in this change was principally due to a million higher tax benefit recognized in as compared to  partially offset by million in higher franchise taxes and million in decreased risk operations due to increased legal expenses 
in the year ended december   there was a tax benefit of million recorded  as compared to million in the year ended december  see discussion above on the tax activity 

table of contents interest income interest income consists primarily of interest and accretion on general partner notes receivable from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest income increased million  or 
this increase was principally a result of million in higher interest due from general partner notes receivable  and million in higher accretion income 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest income decreased million  or 
this decrease was principally a result of million in reduced accretion income  million in lower interest due from general partner notes receivable resulting from the consolidation of real estate partnerships  and therefore the elimination of interest income  as well as the collection of outstanding notes receivable  and million related to gain recognized in second quarter on the sale of certain tax exempt bonds 
recovery of provision for losses on notes receivable for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   recovery of provision for losses on notes receivable changed million from a provision of million in to a recovery of million in for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   provision for losses on notes receivable decreased million 
the provision or recovery in each period was determined based on our periodic review of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio as well as actual cash collections 
we continue to monitor these loans and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis and record provisions as necessary based on the projected operating cash flows of the underlying real estate assets 
interest expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to the newly consolidated properties  million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition properties  and a million decrease in capitalized interest due to redevelopment properties being placed in service 
additionally  an million increase related to the credit facility and term loan of which million was associated with the write off of deferred loan costs related to the november modification of the credit facility and term loan and million related to the payoff of the indebtedness incurred to complete the casden transactions due to higher average principal balances along with a higher weighted average interest rate 
the november modification reduced the spread over libor by an average of  which will favorably impact interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and million term loan 
these increases were partially offset by lower weighted average effective interest rates on mortgage debt due to refinancings that occurred in and for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest expense increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional interest on the debt related to the newly consolidated properties and the acquisition properties  respectively 
deficit distributions to minority partners when real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest  we record a charge equal to the amount of such distribution  even though there is no economic effect or cost 

table of contents for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   deficit distributions to minority partners decreased million  or 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   deficit distributions to minority partners decreased million  or 
each of these decreases were due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity and decreased operating results  as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships decreased million  or 
this decrease in loss was principally the result of increased ownership in certain unconsolidated partnerships and better property operating results at certain properties 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships changed million from equity in earnings of million in to equity in losses of million in this increase was principally the result of the purchase of equity interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships that resulted in these properties becoming consolidated 
such real estate partnerships owned better performing properties that are now contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses 
in addition  the remaining properties within unconsolidated real estate partnerships had decreased earnings driven by lower property operating results in than in gain loss on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other includes our share of gain related to dispositions of real estate within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships  gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities 
gains losses on properties sold are determined on a property by property basis and are not comparable period to period 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased million 
this increase was principally due to a million gain on the sale of a parcel of land located in florida  and million gain from the sale of one of our unconsolidated core properties 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased million 
included in was a loss of approximately million that resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold 
the recognition of this amount in was considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties 
the recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed million 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed million 
the changes in both periods were principally a result of decreased earnings caused by lower property operating results than in the prior year 
income from discontinued operations  net for properties accounted for as held for sale  the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property 
table of contents related revenues and operating expenses  depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale  property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest 
in addition  any impairment losses on assets held for sale  and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported as discontinued operations 
for the years ended december    and  income from discontinued operations  net totaled million  million and million  respectively  which includes income from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
in  the income from operations included properties that were sold or classified as held for sale during in and  the income from operations included properties and properties  respectively  that were sold or classified as held for sale in  and due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales  the income from operations is not comparable year to year 
during  we sold properties  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million which is net of million of related taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in during  we sold properties  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million which is net of million of related taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in during  we sold properties  resulting in a net loss on sale of approximately million including million of related taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in gains losses on properties sold are determined on a property by property basis and are not comparable period to period 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for more details on discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on march   we recorded a million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of fin this charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interest that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization  unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable  we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  excluding interest charges  of the property 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include the general economic climate  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options  local conditions  such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments  that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance  
table of contents increases in operating costs including real estate taxes due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset by increased rents  changes in tax laws and housing laws  including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing  changes in market capitalization rates  and the relative illiquidity of such investments 
any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets  including real estate  goodwill and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets  we have determined that the carrying amount for our properties to be held and used is recoverable and  therefore  we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties during the years ended december   and notes receivable and interest income recognition notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of subordinated notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner 
the ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables  including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders 
our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest  which we refer to as par value notes  and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount  which we refer to as discounted notes 
we record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements 
we discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired  as discussed below  or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest 
we record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method  under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan  thereafter  any additional receipts are recognized as income 
we recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable 
we consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions which include real estate sales  refinancings  foreclosures and rights offerings that provide a reliable source of repayment 
in such instances  we recognize accretion income  on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans  equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value 
we record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method 
for the year ended december   if we had not been able to complete certain transactions  our accretion income would have decreased by million per basic and diluted share 
accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes  therefore  accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods 
allowance for losses on notes receivable we assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis  which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note 
we recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership s real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment 
in certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan  the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan s original effective interest rate 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in net recovery of impairment losses on notes receivable 
during the years ended december  and  we identified and recorded 
table of contents million  and million in impairment losses on notes receivable net of recoveries  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes  and we may adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors 
capitalized costs we capitalize direct and allocable indirect costs including salaries  interest  real estate taxes and other costs incurred in connection with redevelopment  capital improvement and capital replacement activities 
we charge to expense as incurred indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities  including general and administrative expenses 
the amounts capitalized depend on the volume and costs of such activities 
based on the level of capital spending during the year ended december   if capital activities had increased or decreased during the period by  our income before minority interest would have increased or decreased  respectively  by approximately million 
see further discussion under the heading capital expenditures 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure that we believe  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with gaap  is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery  computers or other personal property 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by nareit s april  white paper  which we refer to as the white paper 
we calculate ffo diluted by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock  adding back dividends distributions on dilutive preferred securities and adding back the interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
in addition  although ffo is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts  there can be no assurance that our basis for computing ffo is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  our ffo is calculated as follows amounts in thousands net income attributable to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets depreciation on rental property related to minority partners interest depreciation on rental property related to unconsolidated entities gain loss on disposition of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets deficit distributions to minority partners  net cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations depreciation on rental property  net of minority partners interest gain loss on dispositions of real estate  net of minority partners interest recovery of deficit distributions deficit distributions to minority partners income tax arising from disposals minority interest in aimco operating partnership s share of above adjustments preferred stock dividends redemption related preferred stock issuance costs funds from operations preferred stock dividends redemption related preferred stock issuance costs dividends distributions on dilutive preferred securities interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities funds from operations attributable to common stockholders diluted weighted average number of common shares  common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding common shares and equivalents dilutive preferred securities total notes represents our numerator for earnings per common share calculated in accordance with gaap 
includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner 
such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership 
because the recoverability of these management contracts 
table of contents depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships  we believe it is consistent with the white paper to add back such amortization  as the white paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry 
minority partners interest  means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships 
in accordance with gaap  deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partner s capital account  which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet 
we record these charges for gaap purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost 
deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value 
as a result  the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents  in substance  either a our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or b a cost related to the non controlling partner s share of real estate appreciation 
based on white paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from ffo  we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to ffo 
represents our denominator for earnings per common share diluted calculated in accordance with gaap plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for ffo 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management 
both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations 
additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans 
our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  capital expenditures  dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners  and acquisitions of  and investments in  properties 
we use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs 
in the event that the cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands  we have additional means  such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings  to help us meet our short term liquidity demands 
we use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term borrowings  both secured and unsecured  the issuance of debt or equity securities including op units  the sale of properties and cash generated from operations

table of contents capital expenditures effective january   we classify all capital spending as capital replacements which we refer to as cr  capital improvements which we refer to as ci or redevelopment 
we believe the new classifications are simpler to apply  allow more discrete differentiation between categories  facilitate sound economic decisions  and assist investors and analysts in better understanding our capital spending 
non redevelopment capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between cr and ci based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property ie  the portion that was consumed during our ownership of the item represents cr  the portion of the item that was consumed prior to our ownership represents ci 
for the year ended december   we spent a total of million on cr

off balance sheet arrangements we own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  which interests were acquired through portfolio acquisitions  individual property purchases and separate offers to other limited partners 
our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships ranges typically from less than to 
however  based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements  which grant varying degrees of control  we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes 
the requirement or ability to consolidate a real estate partnership is determined by fin see note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
there are no lines of credit  side agreements  or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees see note of the consolidated financial statements in item

table of contents of the consolidated financial statements in item for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or any other material market rate or price risks 
we use predominantly long term  fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings 
we use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities  property sales proceeds  long term debt or equity financings 
we had  million of floating rate debt outstanding at december  of the total floating rate debt  the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing million  floating rate secured notes million  revolving loans million  and the term loan million 
based on this level of debt  an increase in interest rates of would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
historically  changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than with changes in taxable interest rates 
floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the bma index  which since has averaged of the year treasury yield 
if this relationship continues  an increase in the year treasury yield  of in tax exempt interest rates would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
at december   we had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
as of december   based on our level of floating rate debt of  million  an increase in interest rates of would have resulted in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
the potential reduction of income before minority interests and cash flows due to an increase in interest rates decreased million for compared to due to lower floating rate balances resulting from the redemption of class s cumulative redeemable preferred stock and repayment of a portion of the term loan 
we believe that the fair value of our floating rate secured tax exempt bond debt and floating rate secured long term debt as of december  approximate their carrying values 
the fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements were estimated based on the quoted market rate for the same or similar issues 
the combined carrying amount of our fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds and fixed rate secured notes payable at december  was billion compared to the computed fair value of billion see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
as of december   the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax exempt bonds were as follows dollars in thousands amortization maturities total percentage thereafter
