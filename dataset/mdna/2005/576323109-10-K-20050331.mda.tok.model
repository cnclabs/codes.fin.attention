table of contents part i item business overview mastec  inc collectively  with its subsidiaries  mastec  is a florida corporation which serves providers of telecommunications  broadband including cable  satellite and high speed internet  energy services  traffic control and homeland security systems throughout many parts of north america 
although our clients may contract with us for a full range of services  our offerings are more typically separated into the construction  design  and installation or the maintenance and upgrade  of infrastructure 
we  or our predecessors  have been active in the specialty infrastructure services industry for over years 
in  we provided services to more than clients 
we are one of a limited number of national companies in a highly fragmented industry characterized by small  local companies 
our approximately  employees consistently demonstrate a culture of teamwork and emphasis on safety 
our expertise in various services allows us to address the full range of our clients infrastructure needs  ranging from basic installation and construction to sophisticated engineering  design and integration 
we believe that our experience  size and reputation for quality and reliability provide us with recurring business from our existing clients and position us to attract new clients 
we offer the following services design 
we assist clients with planning and designing infrastructure projects 
we play an active role in site acquisition and work with our clients to evaluate the markets they plan to enter 
we identify potential locations  navigate zoning  permitting and legal channels  negotiate rights of way  and arrange for ownership or leasing 
we handle documentation  material procurement and scheduling 
our engineers are trained in a variety of fields and have an understanding of today s technology 
they build computer generated models  map the layout of cable and diagram installations before they are ready to start work 
this ensures that civil  environmental  structural and electrical detail is addressed and managed properly and that projects are completed on time and on budget 
build 
we build underground and overhead telecommunications  cable  power delivery  traffic control and homeland security systems for our clients 
we believe our fleets of bucket trucks  backhoes  trenchers and other heavy machinery are among the largest in north america 
install 
we have experience installing buried and aerial fiber optic cables  coaxial cables  copper lines  electrical distribution systems and transmission systems in a variety of environments for our clients 
we also install satellite dishes and set top broadband boxes in the homes of our clients customers 
our employees manage the hardware  software and technologies from our clients operations 
our installation focus is both in new projects and areas where there is a need to deploy upgrades and replacements 
maintain and upgrade 
we offer hours a day  days a week  days a year maintenance and support to our clients 
our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our clients distribution facilities and networks as well as emergency services for accidents or storm damage 
we generally provide services to clients under service agreements for upgrade and or maintenance services within a defined geographic territory for multi year terms  and installation construction contracts for specific projects 
we recognize revenue as the related work is performed under these contracts 
some of our larger clients include bellsouth telecommunications  inc  comcast cable communications  inc  directv  progress energy  sprint corporation and verizon communications  inc our aggregate revenue from contracts with these six clients was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the contracts generally provide for extensions by mutual consent 
although these contracts may legally be terminated 
table of contents by our clients for any or no reason on little notice  they can continue in place for many years 
as an example  we  and our predecessor  church tower  have had a relationship with bellsouth for more than twenty years 
in addition  from time to time  we enter into contracts for specific construction projects that are unlikely to be recurring in nature 
we serve clients in the following industries telecommunications 
our technology experience combined with our engineering  design  construction and maintenance capabilities enable us to provide our telecommunications clients with quality networks that carry voice  video  data and internet services to their end users 
some of the specific services that we provide telecommunications companies include excavating  placing and splicing fiber optic  coaxial and copper cable  assembling and placing related structures such as poles  anchors  conduits  manholes  cabinets and closures  placing drop lines from the main distribution terminals to the client s home or business  and maintaining  removing and replacing these facilities 
a representative sample of our telecommunications clients include bellsouth telecommunications  inc  qwest corporation  sbc communications  inc  sprint corporation  and verizon communications  inc  recent capital expenditures by the regional bell operating companies rboc s have been limited primarily to local network maintenance 
these companies curtailed their capital expenditures in part due to economic conditions and also as a result of what they perceive to be a negative regulatory climate 
the federal communications commission  the regulatory oversight body for the rbocs  has sought to encourage local market competition by forcing the rbocs to contract the use of their facilities to competitors at pre established rates which the rbocs have claimed are below their costs 
however  in october  the fcc ruled that rbocs were not obligated to sell capacity to competitors on newly constructed fiber optics networks 
this ruling paves the way for increased spending by our rboc customers 
such actions may improve rboc cash flows and funds available for future investment 
in response to the competitive threat from cable providers  these entities have begun the process to upgrade their copper wire infrastructure with optical fiber an initiative referred to in the industry as fiber to the home or ftth 
three major rboc s verizon  bellsouth and sbc have announced their intentions to enhance their existing high speed data and voice business lines over a more cost effective fiber network 
we believe our relationship with these rboc s positions us to benefit from the market opportunity driven by increased fiber deployments 
rural telephone companies rely on subsidized government loans from rural utility services  a federal government entity  to fund their capital expenditures 
recent capital expenditures by these companies have also been limited  however they appear prepared to proceed with fiber to the home network upgrades as a result of increased funding availability from rural utility services and internal initiatives to offer their customers the latest technologies and reduce the digital divide that has existed to date between rural and urban residents 
in  revenue from our telecommunications services totaled million  or approximately of our total revenue for the year 
broadband 
we assist broadband companies  including cable television and satellite companies  to design  build  install  maintain and upgrade the systems that bring cable television  satellite services  digital services  high speed internet access and telephony to 
table of contents homes in the united states and canada 
our employees are trained in how to handle our clients customers in a professional manner as well as how to educate our clients customers about additional services to build incremental revenue for our clients 
some of the specific services that we provide cable television  satellite and broadband providers include designing cable television systems  building or rebuilding of cable television plants  wiring of multiple dwelling units to allow for broadband service and increased bandwidth  installing cable television and satellite connections and residential cable set top boxes  modems and satellite dishes  and maintaining networks for providers of cable television and broadband services 
a representative sample of our broadband clients includes adelphia communications corporation  charter communications  inc  cogeco cable  inc  comcast cable communications  inc  cox communications  inc  directv  inc  rogers cable  inc  and time warner  inc in  revenue from our broadband services totaled million  or approximately of our total revenue for the year 
directv  inc and comcast cable communications  inc accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenue for energy 
we assist electric  gas and pipeline companies design  build  install  maintain  and upgrade overhead and underground electrical distribution systems  transmission systems  substations  wind farms  switchyards  and natural gas pipelines 
some of the specific services that we provide electric  gas  and pipeline companies include drafting  permitting  material procurement  and engineering design services  building electrical substations and switchyards  installing natural gas pipelines and manholes  installing overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems  maintaining and installing electrical and other utilities transmission and distribution networks  and restoring asphalt and concrete surfaces 
a representative sample of our energy clients include 
table of contents dominion virginia power  florida power and light company  gulf power company  oncor electric delivery company formerly known as txu electric company txu gas company  progress energy  inc  southern co 
georgia power co  and teco energy inc in  our energy services revenue was million  or approximately of our total revenue for the year 
traffic control systems and homeland security 
we help departments of transportation and local municipalities design  build  install  maintain  and upgrade traffic control systems  including video surveillance systems and cameras  remote controlled variable message signs  radar detection devices  traffic signal systems and count stations 
during the year ended december   we provided traffic control services to states plus the district of colombia and were qualified to provide these services to states  the district of colombia and the federal government 
however  as a result of our inability to file our financial statements on a timely basis  the number of states in which we were qualified to do business was reduced in see risk factors if we are unable to obtain our audited financial statements on a timely basis we could experience a decrease in our revenue from some governmental clients 
we began designing  building  installing and maintaining systems in support of federal and state government homeland security projects in we believe homeland security represents a growing market for our services 
our homeland security service offerings include bridge  port  border and airport security and monitoring 
some of the specific services that we provide departments of transportation  local municipalities and state and federal governmental agencies include designing traffic control systems  installing the electronic components of central control centers that remotely monitor and control the operation of multiple traffic control devices  installing video cameras  message signs  radar detection devices  traffic signals  and count stations on public roadways  and maintaining and installing traffic control and homeland security systems 
a representative sample of our traffic control clients include florida department of transportation  georgia department of transportation  tennessee department of transportation  texas department of transportation  and virginia department of transportation 
in  traffic control systems and other government services revenue totaled million  or approximately of our total revenue for the year 

table of contents discontinued operations in march  we ceased performing contractual services in brazil  abandoned all assets in our brazil subsidiary and made a determination to exit the brazil market 
the abandoned subsidiary has been classified as a discontinued operation and its revenue and expenses are not included in the results of continuing operations for any periods presented in this form k 
in november  the subsidiary applied for relief and was adjudicated bankrupt by a brazilian bankruptcy court 
the subsidiary is currently being liquidated under court supervision 
during the fourth quarter  we ceased performing new services and committed to sell our network services division and to exit this service market 
this division has been classified as a discontinued operation and its revenue and expenses are not included in the results of continuing operations for any periods presented in this form k 
backlog at december   we had a backlog in our domestic operations of approximately million 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services we are to perform under project specific contracts and our estimate of work on existing service agreements 
our backlog also includes certain service agreements that contain multiple year terms 
we expect to complete most of our project specific december  backlog during the eighteen months thereafter 
many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services  and many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
since our backlog is subject to unanticipated adjustments and cancellations  it is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future revenue and earnings 
we have historically experienced variances in the components of our backlog for various reasons 
the revenue projected from our backlog may not be realized or  if realized  may not result in profits 
sales and marketing we market our services individually and in combination with other companies to provide the most efficient and effective solution to meet our clients demands  which increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines 
through our unified mastec brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor  equipment and materials  we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet client needs 
we have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the mastec registered service mark and an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions  providing services ranging from basic installation to sophisticated engineering  design and integration 
we believe our long standing relationships with our clients and reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business 
our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our service groups in coordination with our corporate marketing organization 
most of our management has many years of experience in the industries they serve  both at the service provider level and in some cases with the clients we serve 
our service group managers market directly to existing and potential clients for new contracts and also market our company to be placed on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects 
our executive management supplements these efforts at the national level 
safety and insurance risk management our business requires the use of equipment and exposure to conditions that can be hazardous 
although we are committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently  we have been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees  clients and third parties for property damage and personal injuries resulting from the performance of our services 
we are committed to ensuring that our team members perform their work safely and we strive to instill safe work habits in all of our team members 
our policies require that team members complete internal training and service programs relative to each of their tasks and complete those training programs required by law before they commence work on projects 
we evaluate our team members not only on the basis of the efficiency and quality of their work but also on their safety records and the safety records of the team members they supervise 
we also hold regular training sessions and seminars with our team members devoted to safe work practices 
we have established a company wide safety committee to share best practices and to monitor and improve compliance with safety regulations 
the primary claims we face in our operations are workers compensation  automobile liability and various general liabilities 
we maintain insurance policies with respect to these risks  but these policies are subject to per claim deductibles of million for general 
table of contents liability and million for automobile liability 
we have excess umbrella coverages up to million per claim and in the aggregate 
we are required to post letters of credit to secure our obligation to reimburse the insurance carrier for amounts that have been or could potentially be advanced by the carrier within the deductible layer and also post letters of credit to our surety company 
such letters of credit amounted to million at december  we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability are reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
we are working with our insurance carrier to resolve claims more quickly in an effort to reduce our exposure 
we are also attempting to accelerate the claims process where possible so that amounts incurred can be reported rather than estimated 
in addition  known amounts for claims that are in the process of being settled  but that have been paid in periods subsequent to those being reported  are booked in such reporting period 
for example  reliance insurance company  our insurance carrier for certain liabilities through july  was placed into receivership in we have considered the financial condition of reliance in the determination of our unpaid claims  including our estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that would be subject to reimbursement by reliance 
our accruals are based upon known facts  historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
because of increases in claims primarily workers compensation claims  a weak economy  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation  and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to provide the current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
the increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit 
an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity 
if our actual insurance claims or costs are higher than our estimates  it could reduce our profitability and liquidity 
on january   we formed a captive insurance subsidiary  jmc insurance company  inc  a south carolina corporation  to write a portion of our own workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverages under deductible reinsurance policies 
jmc insurance company  inc  which is our first formation and management of a captive insurance company  was capitalized with a million letter of credit 
suppliers and materials for the majority of our contracts  our clients supply their own raw materials and supplies 
we are responsible for installation under those contracts  but not for client materials  material costs or material warranties 
for a minority of our contracts  we obtain materials and supplies for our own account from independent third party providers and do not manufacture any significant amount of materials or supplies for resale 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for any materials or supplies that we obtain for our own account 
we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of materials and supplies 
we use independent contractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow 
these independent contractors typically are sole proprietorships or small business entities 
independent contractors typically provide their own employees  vehicles  tools and insurance coverage 
we are not dependent on any single independent contractor 
our subcontracts typically contain provisions limiting our obligation to pay the subcontractor if our client has not paid us 
these payment limitation provisions may not be available to us in certain cases or jurisdictions 
competition the markets we serve are highly competitive 
the specialty infrastructure services arena is highly fragmented and we normally compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate  ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms 
we also face competition from existing or prospective clients which employ their own personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
the industry is characterized by many small companies whose activities are geographically concentrated 
we are one of a limited number of providers with a nationwide comprehensive service offering 
we compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience  financial and operational resources  nationwide presence  industry reputation and dependability 
while we believe our clients consider a number of these factors in choosing a service provider  most of our clients work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower cost and financial return requirements 

table of contents the competitive environments in the markets we serve are very similar 
however  each market has specific matters impacting the scope of opportunities  as well as the nature and intensity of future competition among infrastructure providers  in that market 
telecommunications 
our telecommunications customers include rboc s and rural telecommunications service providers 
factors impacting the capital improvements and maintenance expenditures of our telecommunications customers include competitive pressures  regulatory oversight  changing technologies  the need for ongoing maintenance  and initiatives to expand and upgrade their systems 
broadband 
we design  build and maintain cable television networks and also provide cable television and satellite residential installation services 
in addition to required ongoing maintenance and systems upgrades  the capital expenditures of our broadband clients are determined by competitive pressures  franchise commitments and evolving technologies 
cable television companies have been upgrading their networks over the past few years with fiber  coaxial cable and higher capacity electronics 
by introducing fiber optics to their networks  the cable television companies now have the capability of providing more channels  interactive services  video on demand  voice over internet protocol or voip  and high speed internet access 
a large number of fiber coaxial networks are now in place 
we believe the cable television industry will continue to consolidate 
consequently  we expect capital expenditures by cable television companies to significantly decrease in the next few years 
conversely  directv continues to add a large number of new subscribers requiring residential satellite installations 
energy 
we design  build and maintain distribution systems  both gas and electrical  for energy providers 
to a lesser extent  we are involved in substation and transmission system construction 
our energy clients capital improvements and maintenance expenditures are driven by demands for increased reliability  safety standards  regulatory requirements and overall economic conditions 
over the past four years the electric power market has experienced a significant decline in spending levels 
it appears the cycle is turning given the improved financial condition of the industry 
after a period of underinvestment  energy providers have shown a renewed strategic focus on core regulated markets 
this should drive growth in transmission and distribution spending in and as energy providers invest in needed upgrades and or expansions of their networks 
traffic control systems and homeland security 
as federal  state and local governments constitute our client base in this market  the nature and level of government authorized expenditures determine the scope of opportunities available to us 
in particular  this industry will be greatly affected by the amount of funds the federal government appropriates for highways across the country under proposed reauthorization of the transportation equity act for the st century tea 
this reauthorization would be a six year extension of the tea of bills related to the tea have passed both the house of representatives and the senate but in different forms 
it is anticipated that congress will extend the tea bill that passed in for a period of time pending the drafting of replacement legislation in the amount of funding ultimately approved by congress will determine the extent to which individual state departments of transportation can pursue additional traffic control systems projects 
regulation as an infrastructure provider  we are governed by the state and federal laws which apply to businesses generally  including regulations related to labor relations  worker safety and environmental protection 
unlike our clients  many of which are in regulated industries for example  utilities which are regulated by the public service commission or broadband companies which are regulated by franchise agreements with various municipalities  as a service provider to these clients we are not directly regulated by these agencies or boards 
our operations are subject to various laws  including those of state and the united states departments of transportation and the occupational safety and health administration  contractor licensing requirements  building and electrical codes  and 
table of contents permitting and inspection requirements 
we do not have any patents that are material to our business 
we believe we have all licenses and permits material to the conduct of our operations and that we are in compliance with all material applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if we fail to comply with any material applicable regulatory requirements  including environmental laws  we could incur significant liabilities 
see risk factors our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
financial information about geographic areas during the years ended december   and we operated in the united states and canada 
in  we became engaged in a single project in mexico which we completed shortly after december  in and  we had operations in brazil 
in  we ceased performing contractual services in brazil  abandoned all assets in our brazil subsidiary and made a determination to exit the brazil market 
the following table reflects financial information for our us and foreign operations including the reclassification of and results of operations for the brazil operations and our network services division to discontinued operations 
over the past three years  we have continued to reduce capital expenditures for long lived assets and have placed greater reliance on operating leases to meet our equipment needs 
year ended december  in thousands revenue united states foreign at december  in thousands long lived assets united states foreign our business  financial condition and results of operation in canada may be adversely impacted by monetary and fiscal policies  currency fluctuations  energy shortages and other political  social and economic developments 
employees as of december   we had approximately  team members 
the total number of our team members has increased from december  by approximately mainly due to an increase in the directv business 
this increase was slightly offset by a decline in the number of employees in brazil 
as a result of ceasing business in brazil  the last of our team members in brazil were terminated in the first quarter of approximately of our team members are represented by labor unions  principally the international union of operating engineers or the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
recruiting 
our primary hiring sources for our team members include promotion from within  team member referrals  print and internet advertising and direct recruiting 
we attract and retain team members by offering technical training opportunities  bonus opportunities  stock ownership  competitive salaries  and a comprehensive benefits package 
our mastec registered brand and integrated service offering also has created a unified corporate culture that we believe helps attract and retain team members 
team members are exposed to numerous technologies being deployed by our clients which serve as a recruitment tool 
we attract talent from numerous sources including higher learning institutions  colleges  and industry 
training and career development 
we believe that our continuous focus on training and career development helps us to retain our team members 
team members participate in on going educational programs  many of which are internally developed  to enhance their technical and management skills through classroom and field training 
manufacturers of telecommunications equipment also sponsor training programs covering the installation and maintenance of their equipment  which our team members regularly attend 
we also provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization that we believe helps retain our team members

the reference to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and should not be considered part of this report 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our industry and our clients industries an economic downturn in the industries we serve may result in certain of our clients being unable to pay us on a timely basis  or at all  and lead to a decrease in demand for our services 
we are subject to the credit risks resulting from changes in the business and economic factors affecting our clients 
commencing in the latter part of and throughout  certain segments of the telecommunications and broadband industries suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our clients filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencing financial difficulties 
included in general and administrative expense in  and were provisions for bad debts of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had remaining receivables from clients undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling million of which million is included in specific reserves for bad debts  with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered through liens or bonds 
the downturn in and resulted in reduced capital expenditures for infrastructure projects  even among clients that did not experience financial difficulties 
although our strategy is to increase the percentage of our business derived from large  financially stable telecommunications  broadband and energy companies and governmental entities  these clients may not continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels 
even if they do continue to fund projects  we may not be able to increase our share of their business 
additional bankruptcies or further decreases in our clients capital expenditures and disbursements could reduce our revenue  cash flows and liquidity and weaken our financial condition 
since the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change  our inability or failure to adjust to our clients changing needs and demands could impact our ability to compete with others who serve those industries 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from clients in the telecommunications and broadband industries 
the telecommunications and broadband industries are subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation 
changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide 
new or developing technologies could displace the wire line systems used for the transmission of voice  video and data  and improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunications and broadband providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
additionally  the telecommunications and broadband industries have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more clients 
the energy industry has also entered into a phase of consolidation similar to the telecommunications and broadband industries  which could lead to the same uncertainties 
our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

table of contents our industry is highly fragmented and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate  ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets 
we also face competition from existing or prospective clients which employ in house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
historically  there have been relatively few significant barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from agreements under which we charge our clients a fixed price for each specified unit of service that we perform 
historically  price has often been the principal factor in determining whether the service provider is awarded the work on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
in addition  we could be underbid by larger competitors in an effort to procure such business 
we may incur goodwill impairment charges which could harm our future operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed the fair market value 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed a review of goodwill for impairment which resulted in a charge of approximately million million  net of tax 
the primary factors contributing to the impairment charge were the overall deterioration of the business climate during and the continued depression of the market values of our common stock and the equity securities of other companies that serve our industry 
in the year ended december   we wrote off approximately million in goodwill in connection with the abandonment of our brazil subsidiary  which is included in the consolidated statements of operations under discontinued operations 
although at the end of and  we performed a review of goodwill for impairment which resulted in no additional charges  we may incur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in the future if the market and business deteriorates 
current and future accounting charges related to impairment would be reflected on our consolidated financial statements as an operating expense 
we may incur restructuring charges which could harm our operating results 
we continuously review our operations in an effort to improve profitability 
in  we implemented a restructuring program under which we eliminated services offerings that no longer fit into our current business strategy  reduced or eliminated services that did not produce adequate revenue or margin  reduced costs of businesses which provided adequate profit contributions but needed margin improvements  and reviewed new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources 
as a result of this program  we incurred a pre tax charge of million in we could incur charges in the future as a result of similar reviews 
the charges would be reflected as an operating expense and would reduce our profitability 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
in such cases  these objects may rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
if we are unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 

table of contents these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we are currently engaged in litigation related to environmental liabilities in coos bay  oregon 
see item legal proceedings 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could adversely impact our revenue and cash flows 
we have  from time to time  received notice from the us department of transportation that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges 
if we cannot successfully resolve these issues  our ability to service our clients could be damaged which could lead to a reduction of our revenue and cash flows 
actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition 
we are subject to various actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business 
claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs 
when appropriate we establish provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 
if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
risks related to our business we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few clients  accordingly  a reduction in our clients demand for our services or the loss of clients would likely impair our financial performance 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately and of our revenue from directv  inc and comcast cable communications  inc  respectively 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately and from comcast cable communications  inc and directv  inc  respectively 
in addition  our top clients accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because our business is concentrated among relatively few major clients  our revenue could decline if we lose one or more of these clients or if the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced 
a significant decline in the work these clients assign us could materially decrease our revenue 
it is expected that comcast revenue will significantly decrease in due to the completion of the rebuild and upgrade of comcast s broadband networks 
a material decline in our revenue would result in a decline in profitability and a deterioration of our financial condition  cash flow and liquidity 
most of our contracts do not obligate our clients to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the work these clients assign us would decrease our revenue 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from service agreements 
under our service agreements  we contract to provide clients with services within defined geographic areas 
each service agreement consists of individual services work orders  each performed for a fixed fee under the agreement 
under these contracts  our clients have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the work these clients assign us would result in a decline in profitability and a deterioration of our financial condition  profitability and liquidity 

table of contents most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice  so our revenue is not guaranteed 
many of our contracts are typically cancelable on short notice  ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon days notice  even if we are not in default under the contract 
therefore  these contracts do not give us the assurances that long term contracts typically provide 
many of our contracts  including our service agreements  are open to public bid at the expiration of their terms 
we may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for bid 
we also provide a significant portion of our services on a non recurring  project by project basis 
we could experience a reduction in our revenue and a decline in profitability which would result in a deterioration of our financial condition  cash flow and liquidity if our clients cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 
our results of operations may be subject to the risk that we may not estimate accurately the costs associated with our services which would harm our results of operations 
our revenue is substantially derived from service agreements and other contracts that are  for the most part  fixed price contracts 
the terms of these contracts require us to guarantee the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated 
our profitability is therefore dependent on our ability to estimate accurately the costs associated with our services 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as lower than anticipated productivity  conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and rising costs of materials and labor 
certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates  which could harm our results of operations or financial condition 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits 
many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services 
in addition  many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
therefore  our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period or at all 
in addition  any contracts included in our backlog that generate revenue may not be profitable 
we have historically experienced variances in the components of our backlog related to project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control and may experience such delays or cancellations in the future 
if our backlog fails to materialize  we could experience a reduction in our revenue and a decline in profitability which would result in a deterioration of our financial condition  profitability and liquidity 
we are effectively self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims and those policies are subject to high deductibles  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the restated liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
known amounts for claims that are in the process of being settled  but that have been paid in periods subsequent to those being reported  are booked in such reporting period 
for example  reliance insurance company  our insurance carrier for certain liabilities through july  was placed into receivership in we have considered the financial condition of reliance in the determination of our unpaid claims  including our estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that would be subject to reimbursement by reliance 
our accruals are based upon known facts  historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
because of increases in claims primarily workers compensation claims  a weak economy  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation  and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to provide the current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
the increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional 
table of contents letters of credit 
an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity 
if our insurance claims or costs are higher than our estimates  it could reduce our profitability 
on january   we formed a captive insurance subsidiary  jmc insurance company  inc  a south carolina corporation  to write a portion of our own workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverages under deductible reinsurance policies 
jmc insurance company  inc  which is our first formation and management of a captive insurance company  was capitalized with a million letter of credit 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings 
some of our contracts require performance and payment bonds 
bonding capacity in the infrastructure industry has become increasingly difficult to obtain  and bonding companies are denying or restricting coverage to certain contractors 
those companies that have been successful in renewing or obtaining coverage have generally been required to post additional collateral to secure the same amount of bonds 
we may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain clients 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future  we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds which would decrease the liquidity that we would have available for growing our business and other purposes 
we reported net losses for the years ended december   and should we continue to incur net losses  our credit ratings could continue to decline and our overall level of bonding capacity could be reduced 
in addition to being a seasonal business  our business may also be affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
the budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services clients end december as a result  our clients typically reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the year 
adverse weather conditions  particularly during the winter season  also affect our ability to render external services in certain regions of the united states and canada 
as a result  we experience reduced revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each year 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently which could reduce our profitability 
our business is labor intensive  and many of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover 
at times of low unemployment rates in the united states  it will be more difficult for us to find qualified personnel at low cost in some areas where we operate 
additionally  our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers 
as we offer new services and pursue new client markets  we will need to increase our operations management support personnel 
we may be unable to hire and retain the sufficient skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
labor shortages or increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced profitability  which would negatively impact our cash flows from operations and liquidity 
we account for a majority of our projects using percentage of completion and units of delivery  therefore variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability 
our work on projects is provided pursuant to contracts for specific installation construction projects or jobs 
for installation construction projects  we recognize revenue on the units of delivery or percentage of completion methods 
we recognize revenue on unit based projects using the units of delivery method 
under the units of delivery method revenue is recognized as the units are completed at the contractually agreed price per unit 
our profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed our original estimates 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on these projects if the estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the project exceed the revenue to be earned on such units 
for certain clients with unit based construction installation contracts  we recognize revenue after the service is performed and as work orders are approved to ensure that collectibility is probable from these customers 
revenue from completed work orders not collected in accordance with the payment terms established with these clients is not recognized until collection is assured 
we recognize revenue on non unit based fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a 
table of contents contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
accordingly  contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
acquisitions include varying degrees of inherent risk that could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity 
we have made  and may in the future make  strategic acquisitions 
these acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the ability to integrate the acquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business  increased indebtedness associated with an acquisition  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs  and the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations 
a failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with or resulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity 
borrowings associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service the debt within the scheduled repayment terms 
risks related to our company and our common stock failure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our business 
we plan to continue to maintain and strengthen internal controls and procedures  to enhance the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting 
see item a controls and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not successful in complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of on a timely basis  our ability to obtain financing may be impaired 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and also requires our independent registered public accountants to attest to this report 
see item a 
controls and procedures 
in the future  we may not be successful in complying with section on a timely basis 
the failure to comply with section could result in a reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of clients  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
we may incur significant expenses due to the purported class action complaints that were filed against us and certain of our officers 
in the second quarter of  purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and one was filed in the united states district court for the southern district 
table of contents of new york 
these cases have been consolidated in the southern district of florida 
the complaints allege certain violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  related to current and prior period earnings reports 
we may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurring significant expenses 
see item legal proceedings 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
from to  for example  our common stock fluctuated from a high of in the first quarter of to a low of in the first quarter of numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock 
such factors include announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors  future sales of our common stock or other securities  announcements of new contracts or clients by us or one of our competitors  market conditions for telecommunications  broadband or energy  or telecommunications  broadband or energy services companies stocks in general  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease 
our credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
at december   we have a million revolving credit facility with zero outstanding  million in subordinated notes outstanding due under an indenture and  in other notes payable outstanding 
the terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders 
the prohibited actions include  among other things making investments in excess of specified amounts  maintaining minimum tangible net worth and fixed charge ratio requirements  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying cash dividends  making capital expenditures in excess of a specified amount  creating certain liens  prepaying our other indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes  engaging in certain mergers or combinations  and engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control as defined in the credit facility and senior subordinated notes indenture 

table of contents as a result of our net loss for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the credit facility at december  the credit facility was amended on march  modifying these covenants and as a result we were in compliance with our amended credit facility s financial covenants at december  should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of the amended credit facility  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or another source of financing to continue to operate 
we may not be able to achieve our projections and thus may not be in compliance with the amended credit facility s financial covenants in the future 
a default could result in the acceleration of either our obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes  or both 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
our business is capital intensive and  to the extent additional financing is needed  we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms which may decrease our liquidity 
if we are unable to obtain our audited financial statements on a timely basis we could experience a decrease in our revenue from some governmental clients 
certain states require that we submit on an annual basis  audited financial statements within days after the end of the audited period in order to qualify as an approved direct bidder for state department of transportation projects 
other state dot s also require us to submit our annual financial information to qualify as an approved direct bidder for their projects 
in the past  such as in the case of our financial statements  we have not completed the audit of our financial statements on a timely basis 
if we fail to submit audited financial statements and other information on a timely basis  our status as an approved bidder for any new state dot work in those states has been  or could be  suspended 
as a result  until we are able to comply with the applicable state dot requirements we could be unable to serve as a direct provider of new services to several state dot s and we could experience a decrease in revenue from these clients 
we may need to provide segment disclosure information in the future 
we are having a dialogue with the us securities and exchange commission sec regarding our possible obligation to discuss and disclose certain segment information in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
we do not believe that segment disclosures are required 
however  if the sec ultimately determines that we should provide such disclosures  we may need to amend this and other past sec reports to add additional disclosures 
such amendments would be to add additional disclosures which are not expected to have any impact on our financial position or results of our operations 
a small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions 
jorge mas  our chairman  and other members of his family beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march  accordingly  they are in a position to influence the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the nomination of individuals to our board of directors  and a change in our control 
these factors may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that other shareholders might consider in their best interest 
our articles of incorporation and florida law contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the florida business corporation act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of mastec and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of mastec 
item properties our corporate headquarters is in a  square foot leased facility in coral gables  florida 

table of contents our operations are conducted from approximately service facilities 
we do not believe any of these facilities is material to our operations because most of our services are performed on clients premises or on public rights of way 
in addition  we believe that suitable alternative locations are available in substantially all areas where we currently conduct business 
we also own property and equipment  which at december  had a net book value of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
this property and equipment includes land  buildings  vans  trucks  tractors  trailers  bucket trucks  backhoes  bulldozers  directional boring machines  digger derricks  cranes  testing and other equipment 
we obtain our equipment from various third party vendors  none of which we depend upon  and did not experience any difficulties in obtaining desired equipment in however  we have experienced recent credit downgrades as a result of our operating losses and other factors  and in the future we may experience difficulties in obtaining desired equipment 
if we are successful in obtaining such equipment  it may be on terms less favorable than previous purchase or leasing arrangements 
item legal proceedings in the second quarter of  purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and one was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
these cases have been consolidated by court order in the southern district of florida 
the complaints allege certain violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  related to current and prior period earnings reports 
on january   a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint was filed by plaintiffs which the court granted 
plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on february  plaintiffs contend that our financial statements during the purported class period of august  to may  were materially misleading in the following areas the financials for the third quarter of were allegedly overstated by million in revenue from unapproved change orders from a variety of our projects  and the financials for the second quarter of were overstated by some million as a result of the intentional overstatement of revenue  inventories and work in progress at our canadian subsidiary 
plaintiffs seek damages  not quantified  for the difference between the stock price plaintiffs paid and the stock price plaintiffs believe they should have paid  plus interest and attorney fees 
we believe the claims are without merit 
we will vigorously defend these lawsuits but may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurring significant expenses 
due to the early stage of these proceedings  any potential loss cannot presently be determined with respect to this litigation 
on july   our board of directors received a demand from a shareholder that the board take appropriate steps to remedy breaches of fiduciary duty  mismanagement and corporate waste  all arising from the same factual predicate set out in the shareholder class actions described above 
on november   the board of directors authorized its executive committee to establish appropriate procedures and form a special litigation committee  as contemplated by florida law  to investigate these allegations and to determine whether it is in our best interest to pursue an action or actions based on said allegations 
on december   a derivative action was filed by the shareholder 
on january   the executive committee formed a special litigation committee to investigate this matter

we contracted to construct a natural gas pipeline for coos county  oregon in construction work on the pipeline ceased in december after the county refused payment due on regular contract invoices of million and refused to process change orders for additional work submitted to the county on or after november  in february  we brought an action for breach of contract against coos county in federal district court in oregon  seeking payment for work done  interest and anticipated profits 
in april  coos county announced it was terminating the contract and seeking another company to complete the project 
coos county subsequently counterclaimed for breach of contract and other causes in the federal district court action 
the amount of revenue recognized on the coos county project that remained uncollected at december  amounted to million representing amounts due to us on normal progress payment invoices submitted under the contract 
in addition to these uncollected receivables  we also have additional claims for payment and interest in excess of million  including all of our change order billings and retainage  which we have not recognized as revenue but to which we believe is due to us under the terms of the contract 
in addition  we were made party to a number of citizen initiated actions arising from the coos county project 
a complaint alleging failure to comply with prevailing wage requirements was issued by the oregon bureau of labor and industry 
a number of individual property owners brought claims in oregon state courts against us for property damages and related claims  a number of citizens groups brought an action in federal court for alleged violations of the clean water act 
all but one of the individual property claims has been settled  one is set for trial in we will vigorously defend these actions  but may incur significant expense in connection with that defense 
in connection with the coos county pipeline project  the united states army corps of engineers and the oregon division of state land  department of environmental quality issued cease and desist orders and notices of non compliance to coos county and to us with respect to the county s project 
a cease and desist order was issued by the corps on october  and addressed sedimentary disturbances and the discharge of bentonite  an inert clay mud employed for this kind of drilling  resulting from directional boring under stream beds along a portion of the natural gas pipeline route then under construction 
the county and mastec received a subsequent cease and desist order from the corps on december  the order addressed additional sedimentary discharges caused by clean up efforts along the pipeline route 
mastec and the county were in substantial disagreement with the united states army corps of engineers and the oregon division of state land as to whether the subject discharges were permitted pursuant to nationwide permit no 
utility line activities or were otherwise prohibited pursuant to the clean water act 
however  we have been cooperating with corps of engineers and the oregon division of state land  department of environmental quality to mitigate any adverse impact as a result of construction 
corps of engineer and oregon division of state land notices or complaints focused for the largest part on runoff from the construction site and from nearby construction spoil piles which may have increased sediment and turbidity in adjacent waterways and roadside ditches 
runoff was the result of extremely wet and snowy weather  which produced exceptionally high volumes of runoff water 
we employed two erosion control consulting firms to assist 
as weather permitted and sites became available  we moved spoil piles to disposal sites 
silt fences  sediment entrapping blankets and sediment barriers were employed in the meantime to prevent sediment runoff 
ultimately  when spring weather permitted  open areas were filled  rolled and seeded to eliminate the runoff 
to date  mitigation efforts have cost us approximately million 
these costs were included in the costs on the project at december  and no further mitigation expenses are anticipated 
the only additional anticipated liability arises from possible fines or penalties assessed  or to be assessed by the corps of engineers and or oregon division of state land 
the county accepted a fine of  to settle this matter with the corp of engineers  the county has not concluded with the oregon department of environmental quality 
no fines or penalties have been assessed against the company by the corp of engineers to date 
on august   the oregon division of state land department of environmental quality issued a notice of violation and assessment of civil penalty to mastec north america in the amount of  mastec north america has denied liability for the civil penalty and requested a formal contested case hearing on the same

the labor union representing the workers of sistemas e instalaciones de telecomunicacion sa sintel  a former mastec subsidiary  initiated an investigative action with a spanish federal court that commenced in july alleging that five former members of the board of directors of sintel  including jorge mas  the chairman of the board of mastec  and his brother juan carlos mas  approved a series of allegedly unlawful transactions that led to the bankruptcy of sintel 
we are also named as a potentially liable party 
the union alleges sintel and its creditors were damaged in the approximate amount of billion pesetas million at

telergy is in bankruptcy and did not pay us for the hugh o kane work 
the settlement was conditioned on the outcome of an interlocutory appeal brought by us 
the appeal sought to enforce termswhich relieved us of our obligation to pay hugh o kane when we were not paid by telergy 
new york s appellate level court upheld the enforceability of the term of our contract  but remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether we were estopped from using this contract provision as a defense 
we expect to recover the bond posted in connection with the appeal  and will continue to contest this matter in the trial court 
the amount of the loss  if any  relating to this matter cannot be determined at this time

overview we serve providers of telecommunications services  broadband services including cable  satellite and high speed internet energy services and traffic control and homeland security systems 
revenue by customer industry group is as follows year ended december  in thousands telecommunications broadband energy government a significant portion of our revenue is derived from service agreements 
some of these agreements are billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
the remainder of these agreements are referred to as master service agreements  because they are exclusive with certain exceptions up to a specified dollar amount per work order within a defined geographic area 
work performed under service agreements is typically generated by work orders  each of which is performed for a fixed fee 
the majority of these services typically are of a maintenance nature and to a lesser extent upgrade services 
these service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bid basis  although clients are often willing to negotiate contract extensions 
table of contents beyond their original terms without re bidding 
our service agreements have various terms  depending upon the nature of the services provided and are typically subject to termination by the client on short notice 
under our master service and similar type service agreements we furnish various specified units of service for a separate fixed price per unit of service 
we recognize revenue as the related unit of service is performed 
profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates on fixed price service agreements 
we also immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on these fixed fee projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the project exceed the revenue to be received from such units 
the remainder of our work is provided pursuant to contracts for specific installation construction projects or jobs 
for installation construction projects  we recognize revenue on the units of delivery or percentage of completion methods 
revenue on unit based projects is recognized using the units of delivery method 
under the units of delivery method  revenue is recognized as the units are completed at the contractually agreed price per unit 
for certain clients with unit based construction installation contracts  we recognize revenue after the service is performed and work orders are approved to ensure that collectibility is probable from these clients 
revenue from completed work orders not collected in accordance with the payment terms established with these clients is not recognized until collection is assured 
revenue on non unit based contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs 
clients are billed with varying frequency weekly  monthly or upon attaining specific milestones 
such contracts generally include retainage provisions under which to of the contract price is withheld from us until the work has been completed and accepted by the client 
revenue by type of contract is as follows year ended december  in thousands master service and other service agreements installation construction projects agreements our costs of revenue include the costs of providing services or completing the projects under our contracts including operations payroll and benefits  fuel  subcontractor costs  equipment rental  materials not provided by our clients  and insurance 
profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates on fixed price service agreements 
we also immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on fixed fee projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the project exceed the revenue to be received from such units 
our clients generally supply materials such as cable  conduit and telephone equipment 
customer furnished materials are not included in revenue and cost of sales due to all materials being purchased by the customer 
the customer determines the specifications of the materials that are to be utilized to perform installation construction services 
we are only responsible for the performance of the installation construction services and not the materials for any contract that includes customer furnished materials nor do we not have any risk associated with customer furnished materials 
our customers retain the financial and performance risk of all customer furnished materials 
general and administrative expenses include all costs of our management and administrative personnel  severance payments  reserves for bad debts  rent  utilities  travel and business development efforts and back office administration such as financial services  insurance  administration  professional costs and clerical and administrative overhead 
in march  we ceased performing contractual services in brazil  abandoned all assets of our brazil subsidiary and made a determination to exit the brazil market 
during the year ended december   we wrote off approximately million in goodwill and the net investment in our brazil subsidiary of approximately million which consisted of the accumulated foreign currency translation loss of million less a net deficit in assets of million 
the abandoned subsidiary has been classified as a discontinued operation and its net losses are not included in our consolidated net loss from continuing operations for the years ended december   and the net income loss for our brazil subsidiary was reclassified to discontinued operations in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss for the year ended december  included in discontinued operations was million 
in november  the subsidiary applied for relief and was adjudicated bankrupt by a brazilian bankruptcy court 
the subsidiary is currently being liquidated under court supervision 

table of contents during the fourth quarter  we ceased performing services and committed to sell our network services division and exit this service market 
this division has been classified as a discontinued operation and its net losses are not included in our consolidated net loss from continuing operations for the years ended december    and the net loss for the network services division was reclassified to discontinued operations in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss for the year ended december  included in discontinued operations was million 
financial metrics members of our senior management team regularly review key performance metrics and the status of operating initiatives within our business 
these key performance indicators are revenue by client and industry  monthly  quarterly and annual changes in revenue by client and industry  backlog  costs of revenue  and general and administrative expenses as percentages of revenue  number of vehicles and equipment per employee  days sales outstanding  and interest and debt service coverage ratios 
we analyze this information periodically through operating reviews which include detailed discussions related to significant jobs projects  proposed investments in new business opportunities or property and equipment and integration and cost reduction efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  reserves and accruals  impairment of assets  income taxes  insurance reserves and litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions change or if certain key assumptions used in making these estimates ultimately prove to be materially incorrect 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue and related costs for master and other service agreements billed on a time and materials basis are recognized as the services are rendered 
there are also some master service agreements that are billed on a fixed fee basis 
under our fixed fee master service and similar type service agreements we furnish various specified units of service for a separate fixed price per unit of service 
we recognize revenue as the related unit of service is performed 
for service agreements on a fixed fee basis  profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates 
we also immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on these fixed fee projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units exceed the revenue to be received from such units 

table of contents we recognize revenue on unit based construction installation projects using the units of delivery method 
our unit based contracts relate primarily to contracts that require the installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system 
under the units of delivery method  revenue is recognized at the contractually agreed upon price as the units are completed and delivered 
our profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed our original estimates 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the project exceed the revenue to be earned on such units 
for certain clients with unit based construction installation contracts we recognize revenue after service has been performed and work orders are approved to ensure that collectibility is probable from these clients 
revenue from completed work orders not collected in accordance with the payment terms established with these clients is not recognized until collection is assured 
our non unit based  fixed price installation construction contracts relate primarily to contracts that require the construction design and installation of an entire infrastructure system 
we recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on non unit based  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on contract revenue and estimates of total expected costs 
we estimate total project costs and profit to be earned on each long term  fixed price contract prior to commencement of work on the contract 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and recognize profit or loss as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs  after adjusting estimated total contract costs for the most recent information 
if  as work progresses  the actual contract costs exceed our estimates  the profit we recognize from that contract decreases 
we recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on a contract at the time our estimates indicate such a loss 
our clients generally supply materials such as cable  conduit and telephone equipment 
customer furnished materials are not included in revenue and cost of sales as all materials are purchased by the customer 
the customer determines the specifications of the materials that are to be utilized to perform installation construction services 
we are only responsible for the performance of the installation construction services and not the materials for any contract that includes customer furnished materials nor do we not have any risk associated with customer furnished materials 
our customers retain the financial and performance risk of all customer furnished materials 
we have commenced legal action against some of our clients in connection with work performed in in addition  we have made claims for amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from clients for delays we believe were caused by the clients  errors in specifications and designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to either scope or price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
although any costs for the work related to these claims have been included in costs of revenue  since we cannot reliably estimate what amounts  if any  of these claims are probable of collection  we have not recognized any of these claims as revenue to date 
we will recognize revenue on these claims upon collections 
we may not be successful in collecting any of these claims 
see item legal proceedings 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
management analyzes past due balances based on invoice date  historical bad debt experience  client concentrations  client credit worthiness  client financial condition and credit reports  the availability of mechanics and other liens  the existence of payment bonds and other sources of payment  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review the adequacy of reserves for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
if our estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable are incorrect  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required  which could reduce our profitability 
our estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts are subject to significant change during times of economic weakness or uncertainty in either the overall us economy or the industries we serve  and our loss experience has increased during such times 
we recorded provisions against earnings for doubtful accounts of   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents inventories inventories consist of materials and supplies for construction projects  and are typically purchased on a project by project basis 
inventories are valued using the weighted average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
construction projects are completed pursuant to customer specifications 
the loss of the customer or the cancellation of the project could result in an impairment of the value of materials purchased for that customer or project 
technological or market changes can also render certain materials obsolete 
allowances for inventory obsolescence are determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances for each project and market conditions 
during  and  we recorded inventory obsolescence provisions of million  million and million  respectively  that have been included in costs of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations in item of this annual report on form k 
depreciation we depreciate our property and equipment over estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically review changes in technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity and salvage values to determine adjustments to estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
effective november   we implemented the results of a review of the estimated service lives of our property and equipment in use 
useful lives were adjusted to reflect the extended use of much of our equipment 
in addition  the adjustments made the estimated useful lives for similar equipment consistent among all operating units 
depreciation expense was reduced by million for the years ended december  and from the amount of expense which would had been reported using the previous useful lives as a result of the change of estimate 
during we also implemented a plan to improve profitability by more effectively utilizing our fleet 
under the plan  we began disposing of excess or underutilized assets in during and  we continued to dispose of excess assets and increased our reliance on operating leases to finance equipment needs  thereby reducing our depreciation expense 
we do anticipate continued declines in our depreciation expense  since we believe we can continue to use more lease opportunities 
valuation of equity investments 
we have one common stock investment which we account for by the equity method because we own between and of the common stock and we have a non controlling ownership interest 
our share of the earnings or losses in this investment is included in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our investment exceeded the net equity of such investment and accordingly the excess is considered to be equity goodwill 
we evaluate the equity goodwill for impairment under accounting principles board no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  as amended 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r which clarified some of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin and exempted certain entities from its requirements 
fin r was effective on march  we have considered the provisions of fin r for this investment and believe it will not be necessary to include in our consolidated financial statements any assets  liabilities or activities of this investment 
we have provided certain disclosed information of this investment in this annual report on form k in item financial statements 
note valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

in analyzing potential impairment  we use projections of future undiscounted cash flows from the assets 
these projections are based on our views of growth rates for the related business  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
however  economic conditions  interest rates  the anticipated cash flows of the businesses related to these assets and our business strategies are all subject to change in the future 
if changes in growth rates  future economic conditions or discount rates and estimates of terminal values were to occur  long lived assets may become impaired 
during  and  we recognized impairment losses and write offs of long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively  relating to long lived assets no longer in use and held for sale  certain assets in use and long lived assets related to the discontinued operations in brazil 

table of contents valuation of intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct  on at least an annual basis  a review of our reporting units to determine whether their carrying value exceeds fair market value as determined using a discounted cash flow methodology for each unit 
should this be the case  the value of our goodwill may be impaired and written down 
our adoption of sfas no 
in resulted in a write down of our goodwill  net of tax  in the amount of million net of million tax benefit  to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
this charge was reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations included in item of this annual report on form k  of which million has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
impairment losses subsequent to adoption totaling million million  net of tax are reflected in our operating results in the consolidated statement of operations for in connection with the disposition of the brazil subsidiary  we wrote off goodwill associated with this reporting entity in the amount of million in which is included in discontinued operations 
we could record additional impairment losses if  in the future  profitability and cash flows of our reporting units decline to the point where the carrying value of those units exceed their market value 
insurance reserves we presently maintain insurance policies subject to per claim deductibles of million for our workers compensation  and general liability policies and million for our automobile liability policy 
we have excess umbrella coverages up to million per claim and in the aggregate 
we are required to post letters of credit to secure our obligation to reimburse the insurance carrier for amounts that have been or could potentially be advanced by the carrier within the deductible layer and also post letters of credit to our surety company 
such letters of credit amounted to million at december  we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
we are working with our insurance carrier to resolve claims more quickly in an effort to reduce our exposure 
we are also attempting to accelerate the claims process where possible so that amounts incurred can be reported rather than estimated 
in addition  known amounts for claims that are in the process of being settled  but that have been paid in periods subsequent to those being reported  are booked in such reporting period 
for example  reliance insurance company  our insurance carrier for certain liabilities through july  was placed into receivership in we have considered the financial condition of reliance in the determination of our unpaid claims  including our estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that would be subject to reimbursement by reliance 
our accruals are based upon known facts  historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
if we do not accurately estimate the losses resulting from these claims  we may experience losses in excess of our estimated liability  which may reduce our profitability 
we also may be required to post additional collateral with the insurance carrier  which could reduce our liquidity  or pay increased insurance premiums  which could decrease our profitability 
on january   we formed a captive insurance subsidiary  jmc insurance company  inc  a south carolina corporation  to write a portion of our own workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverages under deductible reinsurance policies 
jmc insurance company  inc  which is our first formation and management of a captive insurance company  was capitalized with a million letter of credit 
income taxes we record income taxes using the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
the recording of a net deferred tax asset assumes the realization of such asset in the future 
otherwise a valuation allowance must be recorded to reduce this asset to its net realizable value 
we consider future pretax income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for such a valuation allowance 
in the event that 
table of contents we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset is charged against income in the period such determination is made 
as a result of our and operating losses  we have recorded valuation allowances aggregating million and million as of december  and  respectively  to reduce certain of our net deferred federal  foreign and state tax assets to their estimated net realizable value 
restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we initiated a study to determine the proper balance of downsizing and cost cutting in relation to our ability to respond to current and future work opportunities in each of our service offerings 
the review not only evaluated our current operations  but also the growth and opportunity potential of each service offering as well as the consolidation of back office processes 
as a result of this review  we implemented a restructuring program which included elimination or reduction in the scope of service offerings that no longer fit into our core business strategy or long term business plan 
reduction or elimination of services that do not produce adequate revenue or margins to support the level of profitability  return on investment or investments in capital resources 
this includes exiting contracts that do not meet the minimum rate of return requirements and aggressively seeking to improve margins and reduce costs 
analysis of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but still need margin improvements which includes aggressive cost reductions and efficiencies 
review of new business opportunities in similar business lines that can utilize our existing human and physical resources 
the elements of the restructuring program included involuntary terminations of employees in affected service offerings and the consolidation of facilities 
the plan resulted in a pre tax charge to operations of million in the involuntary terminations impacted both the salaried and hourly employee groups 
approximately  employees were impacted in as of december   all employees to be terminated pursuant to our restructuring program have been terminated 
we also closed approximately facilities during as part of the program in which some of the assets were sold  while other assets were retained and transferred to other locations 
these facility closures were not accounted for as discontinued operations due to these facilities not representing separate components of our business for which cash flows could be clearly defined 
we also continue to be involved in the markets in which these facilities operated 
in addition to the costs noted above  we paid a consulting firm approximately million to assist us in preparing the plan  all of which was expensed in as the plan was complete as of december  we also recognized valuation allowances and impairment losses related to property and equipment of approximately million in connection with the restructuring plan in the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of the restructuring accruals as of december  which represents remaining lease costs as well as reductions in the restructuring accruals during in thousands accrued costs at december  cash payments accrued costs at december  economic conditions  our business strategies or other factors could dictate further downsizing or elimination of elements of our business in the future  resulting in additional restructuring charges in litigation and contingencies litigation and contingencies are reflected in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessments  along with legal counsel  of the expected outcome of such litigation or expected resolution of such contingency 
an accrual is made when the loss of such contingency is probable and estimable 
if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs significantly from our 
table of contents current expectations  such outcome could result in a charge to earnings 
see part i item legal proceedings 
for discussions of current litigation 
results of operations restatement of financial statements in connection with the filing of our form k  we restated our annual financial statements for the year ended december  to increase our insurance expense net of tax and to record a valuation allowance for certain of our net deferred state tax assets

outlook we believe we have increased market opportunities in in five areas fiber to the home ftth in many markets  cable television providers have upgraded their networks to fiber optics which can provide video  video on demand  pay per view  high speed internet and telephony using voip 
in contrast  rboc s  municipalities and rural telephone companies presently rely primarily on copper wire infrastructures 
in response to the competitive threat from cable providers  these entities have begun the process to upgrade their infrastructures with optical fiber  or ftth 
we believe that our resources  relationships and capabilities position us to benefit from the market opportunity 
we also believe our rural telephone company clients will proceed with ftth projects  utilizing available funding from the rural utility service 
additionally  some municipalities are expected to build their own ftth networks  and we are pursuing greater levels of business with these customers 
the three major rboc s have announced their intentions to enhance their infrastructures which may increase revenue in we have already experienced an increase in this type of revenue in the first quarter of 
table of contents satellite install to the home directv continues to add a large number of new subscribers  which represents an expected increase in revenue for our installation and maintenance work in this area 
federal market for telecommunications upgrades the federal government plans to continue to upgrade its telecommunications networks and systems for military bases  ports  borders and security systems 
we are making a concerted effort to market to major government contracting firms and believe we can establish ourselves as a participant in this market 
local maintenance work for electrical grid upgrades we believe market and other conditions are making it increasingly attractive for utilities to outsource their maintenance activities and we are marketing our services in this area 
rboc maintenance agreements we serve rboc s in states that are currently experiencing increases in population such as florida  georgia  nevada  north carolina  south carolina  and texas 
we believe that population increases in these states could increase the demand for our services 
our results could be adversely affected by the matters discussed in item under the title risk factors of this annual report on form k and by the matters discussed in the paragraphs that follow 
the revenue from comcast in and was driven to a significant extent by large projects to rebuild and upgrade comcast s existing broadband networks in certain areas of the country 
this rebuild and upgrade work will be minimal in due to most of the work being completed by december  consequently  revenue from comcast will significantly decline in to replace this revenue  we plan to pursue additional work from our broadband customers for installations to new and existing homes and more maintenance and repair work 
in addition  we plan to pursue additional work related to ftth initiatives 
our status as an approved bidder on any state department of transportation dot work is dependent in part on our submission on a timely basis of audited financial statements 
due to the delay in the completion of our audit  we were unable to submit our financial statements within the period required by the states of florida and texas 
these states require that we submit on an annual basis  audited financial statements within days after the end of the audited period 
several other state dots also require us to submit our annual financial information to qualify as an approved direct bidder for their projects 
we have subsequently requalified in texas  but remain unqualified in florida and several other states 
until we submit our audited financial statements and other information on a timely basis  our status as an approved bidder for new states dot work has been  or could be  suspended 
as a result  until we are able to comply with the applicable state dot requirements we could be unable to serve as a direct provider of new services to several state dots and  we could experience a decrease in revenue from these clients 
we have commenced legal action against some of our clients in connection with work performed in outstanding accounts receivable  exclusive of claims amounts relating to contracts on which we are making claims amounted to million at december  in addition  we have made claims for amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from clients for delays we believe were caused by the client  errors in specifications and designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
any costs for the work related to these claims have been included in costs of revenue in however  as we cannot conclude that any of these claim amounts are probable of collection  we have not recognized such claim amounts as revenue for the years ended december  and if we are unsuccessful in our negotiations with our clients for some of these claims  we will take legal actions in an attempt to collect such amounts 
our clients may counterclaim against us for alleged contract damages  alleged liquidated damages and or indemnification 
if our clients can establish a contract entitlement  that entitlement could reduce any amounts otherwise due us from the client including any remaining outstanding accounts receivable from the customer under the agreed contract price and or create liabilities for us 
in the second quarter of  purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and one was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
these cases have been consolidated in the southern district of florida 
the complaints allege certain violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  related to current and prior period earnings report 
plaintiffs contend that our financial statements during the purported class period of august  to may 
table of contents  were materially misleading 
see item legal proceedings for full description of claims 
we believe the claims are without merit 
we may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurring significant expenses 
under our credit facility  we are required to be in compliance with certain covenants 
as a result of our net loss for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility at december  the credit facility was amended on march  modifying these covenants and as a result we were in compliance with our amended credit facility s financial covenants at december  we are dependent upon borrowings and letters of credit under the credit facility to fund our operations 
while we believe we will be in compliance with the terms and covenants of the amended credit facility for  we may not be able to achieve our internal projections and thus may not be in compliance with the terms and covenants of our amended credit facility 
should we be unable to comply with such terms and covenants  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the credit facility or another source of financing to continue to operate

comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was due primarily to the increased revenue of approximately million received from directv and  to a lesser extent government and telecommunication customers 
revenue from telecommunications increased million in we expect this trend to continue to increase in the increase in revenue was offset by a decrease in revenue from energy clients by million in due to the gas pipeline and electrical substation revenue projects being completed in and a slight decrease in revenue from broadband clients due to the comcast work slowing down towards completion at the end of while we have refocused our business towards large  financially stable telecommunications  broadband  energy  governmental and other clients  these clients may not continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels or we may not be able to increase our market share with these stronger clients

in addition  we recorded obsolescence provisions for inventory of million mainly due to inventories that were purchased for specific jobs no longer in process and which may not be used in the future 
in the year ended december   an obsolescence provision was recorded in the amount of million 
these decreases were offset by the increase in cost of sales due to the increase in the number of employees and subcontractor costs related to the directv business 
in addition  insurance expense increased in the year ended december  due to the increased number of claims reported 
as a result of the increased claims and loss history since the beginning of  we adjusted our actuarial assumptions and increased our reserves and expenses by million in the year ended december  depreciation

our balance sheet as of december   includes a net deferred tax asset of million of which million relates to federal taxes and the remainder to various state and foreign taxes  net of valuation allowance 
the realization of this net deferred tax asset is dependent upon our ability to generate future pretax income 
we anticipate that we will generate sufficient pretax income in the future to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset relating to federal income taxes 
in making this assessment  we have considered our projected future pretax income based upon a prudent and feasible tax planning strategy available to us involving the sale of one of our divisions 
however  this tax planning strategy does not appear viable for the purpose of realizing all of the various income tax components of our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we recorded an addition to our valuation allowance of million in to reduce certain of our net deferred federal  foreign and state tax assets at december   to their estimated net realizable value of million 
the primary reason for the difference in our effective tax rate from to was the effect of worthless stock deduction and increase in valuation allowance

overall revenue from broadband customers grew by million in revenue from energy clients grew by million in to million compared to million in primarily due to new gas pipeline and electrical substation contracts 
our revenue from government work increased by million in compared to due to an increase in dollar value of projects and expansion of the business into new states in our overall revenue growth was reduced by a million decrease in telecommunications revenue 
historically  we have derived a significant amount of our revenue from telecommunications clients 
commencing in the latter part of and throughout  certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our clients filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencing financial difficulties

we also recorded a valuation provision for state deferred taxes in however  this provision was less material to our overall deferred benefit in the primary reason for the difference in our effective tax rate from to was the effect of non us operations  specifically losses from our operations in mexico and brazil for which we recorded no tax benefit

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from continuing operations  borrowings under revolving lines of credit  and proceeds from sales of assets and investments 
we expect to continue selling vehicles and equipment as we see the need to upgrade with new equipment 
we expect to continue to obtain proceeds from these sales in excess of million per quarter depending upon market conditions 
our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  letters of credit and debt service 
in addition to ordinary course working capital requirements  we will continue to spend at least to million per year on capital expenditures in order to keep our equipment new and in good condition 
we also expect our annual lease payments to increase as we place greater reliance on operating leases to meet our equipment needs 
interest payments of approximately million are due each 
table of contents february and august under our subordinated debt agreement 
in  we purchased a interest in a limited liability company with an established marketing group 
the initial investment of million will be paid over four quarters which commenced in the third quarter of with additional contingent payments of up to million per quarter based upon the level of unit sales and profitability of the limited liability company for the two years following the period after the initial investment is fully funded 
we anticipate that funds generated from continuing operations  together with borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from sales of assets and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  letters of credit and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months 
we need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business  primarily due to the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work  and the corresponding spending by our clients on their annual capital expenditure budgets 
our business is slower in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year and stronger in the second and third quarters 
we generally experience seasonal working capital needs from approximately april through september to support growth in unbilled revenue and accounts receivable  and to a lesser extent  inventory 
our billing terms are generally net to days  although some contracts allow our clients to retain a portion from to of the contract amount until the contract is completed to their satisfaction 
we maintain inventory to meet the material requirements of some of our contracts 
some of our clients pay us in advance for a portion of the materials we purchase for their projects  or allow us to pre bill them for materials purchases up to a specified amount 
our vendors generally offer us terms ranging from to days 
our agreements with subcontractors usually contain a pay when paid provision  whereby our payments to subcontractors are made after we are paid by our clients 
as of december   we had million in working capital compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital was due to an increase in inventory and a decrease in current maturities of long term debt offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable was the result of a successful collections effort in the fourth quarter of the decrease in current maturities of long term debt resulted in the payoff of all long term debt obligations except for the senior subordinated notes 
the increase in inventory was due to the growth in our directv business and the fact that in october directv ceased providing inventory on consignment  requiring us to purchase inventory from directv 
as a result  as our directv business increases  our inventory will also increase 
cash and cash equivalents remained consistent from million at december  to million at december  at december   the cash balance includes million in restricted cash related to collateral on our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in was primarily related to timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors offset by the loss from continuing operations

we have a revolving credit facility for our north american operations that provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of million 
the amount that we can borrow at any given time is based upon a formula that takes into account  among other things  eligible billed and unbilled accounts receivable  which can result in borrowing availability of less than the full amount of the 
table of contents facility 
as of december  and  net availability under the credit facility totaled million and million  net of outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating million and million  respectively 
at december   million of the outstanding letters of credit are issued to support our casualty insurance requirements or surety needs 
these letters of credit mature at various dates through december   and except for letters of credit totaling million  most have automatic renewal provisions subject to prior notice of cancellation 
we had no outstanding draws under the credit facility on december  and the revolving credit facility matures on january  the revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our north american assets including million in restricted cash which is included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and a pledge of the stock of certain of our operating subsidiaries 
all wholly owned subsidiaries collateralize the facility 
interest under the facility accrues at rates based  at our option  on the agent bank s base rate plus a margin of between and or its libor rate as defined in the credit facility plus a margin of between and  each margin depending on certain financial thresholds 
the facility includes an unused facility fee of  which may be adjusted to as low as or as high as depending on the amount of the total commitment which is unused 
the revolving credit facility contains customary events of default including cross default provisions and covenants related to our north american operations that prohibit  among other things  making investments and acquisitions in excess of a specified amount  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying cash dividends  making other distributions in excess of a specified amount  making capital expenditures in excess of a specified amount  creating liens against our assets  prepaying other indebtedness including our senior subordinated notes  and engaging in certain mergers or combinations without the prior written consent of the lenders 
in addition  any deterioration in the quality of billed and unbilled receivables would reduce availability under our revolving credit facility 
we are required to be in compliance with certain financial covenants measured on a monthly basis 
as a result of our net loss for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with a monthly financial covenant  the fixed charge coverage ratio  of the credit facility at december  the credit facility was amended on march  modifying this covenant and other financial covenants and we were in compliance with our amended credit facility s financial covenants at december  under the amended agreement  our north american operations must maintain minimum tangible net worth equal to million at december   million from january through may   million from june through august   million from september through november   then million beginning december   plus of the consolidated net income of our operations from december  through the date of determination 
since april   our north american operations was also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  computed on a monthly basis  beginning in may the fixed charge coverage ratio is generally defined to mean the ratio of our net income before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  and amortization expense plus million to consolidated interest expense and current maturities of debt for the period of determination 
for the purposes of determining the current maturities of long term debt during the period from april through march used in determining the fixed charge coverage ratio the amount of current maturities of long term debt as of any month during this period is multiplied by a fraction  the numerator of which is the number of cumulative months since april  and the denominator of which is current ratio requirements are period ratio for the month period ending december  to for each of the and month periods ending january and february  to for each of the month periods ending march  april and may  to for each of the month periods ending june  july  and august  to for each of the month periods ending on september  october  and november  to for the month period ending on december  and each month period ending on the last day of each calendar month thereafter to 
table of contents based upon our projections for  we believe we will be in compliance with the amended credit facility s financial covenants for we are dependent upon borrowings and letters of credit under this credit facility to fund operations 
should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of the amended credit facility  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the credit facility or another source of financing to continue to operate 
we may not be able to achieve our projections and thus may not be in compliance with the amended credit facility s financial covenants in as of december   we have outstanding million  senior subordinated notes due in february  with interest due semi annually 
the notes also contain default including cross default provisions and covenants restricting many of the same transactions as under our credit facility 
the indenture which governs our senior subordinated notes allows us to incur the following additional indebtedness the credit facility up to million  renewals to existing debt permitted under the indenture plus an additional million of indebtedness 
the indenture prohibits incurring further indebtedness unless our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters determined on a proforma basis as if that additional debt has been incurred at the beginning of the period 
the definition of our fixed charge coverage ratio under the indenture is essentially equivalent to that under our credit agreement 
our credit standing and senior subordinated notes are rated by various agencies 
in august  standard poor s withdrew its rating of our corporate credit  senior secured and subordinated debt 
in its press release  standard poor s stated that the withdrawal was due to insufficient financial information available to support a ratings opinion due to the delays in our form q filings in this withdrawal has not had an impact on our liquidity or ability to obtain necessary financing 
in  we performed work on undocumented or unapproved change orders or other matters which are being disputed by our clients 
we did not recognize this work as revenue in or in the year ended december  however  expenses for the work associated with these change orders and other matters were included in costs of revenue in resulting in a decline in our margins 
this has also affected our liquidity since we still have not been paid for the work performed 
we have commenced legal action against some of our clients in connection with work performed in in addition  we have made claims for amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from customers for delays we believe were caused by the customer  errors in specifications and designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
our customers may counterclaim against us for contract damages  liquidated damages and or indemnification 
if the customers can establish a contract entitlement  that entitlement could reduce any amounts otherwise due us from the customer including any remaining outstanding accounts receivable from the customer under the contract price and or create liabilities for us 
should we be successful in collecting some of these claims we would recognize them as revenue when received 
when revenue is recognized the margins will increase during such period of recognition since the costs have already been recorded 
however  we may not be successful in collecting any of these claims 
in the second quarter of  purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and one was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
these cases have been consolidated by court order in the southern district of florida 
the complaints allege certain violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  related to current and prior period earnings reports 
on january   a motion for leave to file a second amended compliant was filed by plaintiffs which the court granted 
plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on february  plaintiffs contend that our financial statements during the purported class period of august  to may  were materially misleading in the following areas the financials for the third quarter of were allegedly overstated by million in revenue from unapproved change orders from a variety of our projects  and the financials for the second quarter of were overstated by some million as a result of the intentional overstatement of revenue  inventories and work in progress at our canadian subsidiary 
plaintiffs seek damages  not quantified  for the difference between the stock price plaintiffs paid and the stock price plaintiffs believe they should have paid  plus interest and attorney fees 
we believe the claims are without merit 
we will vigorously defend these lawsuits but may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurring significant expenses 
the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of december  and our anticipated payment obligations during the periods indicated below in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period more than less than years and contractual obligations total year years years thereafter senior subordinated notes notes payable for equipment equity investment capital leases operating leases executive life insurance total amounts do not include interest payments 
we estimate that we will pay an additional million and million in and each of the years between and  respectively in interest payments for our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facilities off balance sheet arrangements we provide letters of credit to secure our obligations primarily related to our insurance arrangements and surety bonds 
we also provide letters of credit related to legal matters 
total letters of credit reduce our available borrowings under our credit facility and amounted to million at december  of which million were related to insurance matters and surety bond requirements 
some of our contracts require us to provide performance and payment bonds  which we obtain from a surety company 
if we were unable to meet our contractual obligations to a client and the surety paid our client the amount due under the bond  the surety would seek reimbursement of such payment from us 
at december   performance and payment bonds outstanding on our behalf totaled million 
seasonality our operations are historically slower in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this seasonality is primarily the result of client budgetary constraints and preferences and the effect of winter weather on our external activities 
some of our clients tend to complete budgeted capital expenditures before the end of the year and defer additional expenditures until the following budget year 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is increased labor costs 
we did not experience significant increases in labor costs in or to a lesser extent  we are also affected by increases in fuel costs which increased significantly in and are expected to continue to increase in recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  sab to revise or rescind portions of the interpretative guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the principal revisions relate to the rescission of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in us generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of sab during december did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition
