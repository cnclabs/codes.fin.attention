item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we operate in the fragrance and cosmetic industry  and manufacture  market and distribute a wide array of fragrances  cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
we manage our business in two segments  french based operations and united states based operations 
we specialize in prestige perfumes and mass market perfumes  cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
most of our prestige products are produced and marketed by our owned subsidiary in paris  inter parfums  sa  which is also a publicly traded company as of inter parfums  sa shares trade on the paris bourse 
prestige cosmetics and prestige skin care products represent less than of consolidated net sales 
our mass market products are primarily produced and marketed by our united states operations 
o prestige products for each prestige brand  owned or licensed by us  we develop an original concept for the perfume  cosmetic or skincare line consistent with world market trends 
o mass market products we design  market and distribute inexpensive fragrances and personal care products  including alternative designer fragrances  mass market cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
our prestige product lines  which are manufactured and distributed by us primarily under license agreements with brand owners  represented approximately of net sales during since we have built a portfolio of brands under license  which include burberry  st dupont  paul smith  christian lacroix  celine  diane von furstenberg and lanvin whose products are distributed in over countries around the world 
in terms of sales  burberry is our most significant license  and sales of burberry products represented  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have acquired two licenses with affiliates of our strategic partner  lv capital  usa inc lv capital  a wholly owned subsidiary of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa lvmh lv capital owns approximately of our outstanding common shares 
in may we entered into an exclusive worldwide license for prestige fragrances for the celine brand  and in march we entered into an exclusive worldwide license for christian lacroix fragrances 
in january  lvmh sold the christian lacroix company to an unaffiliated third party  subject to the existing license 
both licenses are subject to certain minimum sales requirements  advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry 
we believe that our association with lv capital has enhanced our creditability in the cosmetic industry  which should lead us to additional opportunities in our industry that might not have been otherwise available to us 
our united states operations  which primarily consists of mass market product lines  represented of sales for the year ended december   and are comprised of alternative designer fragrances  cosmetics  health and beauty aids and personal care products 
these lines are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license agreements we have for the trademarks jordache and tatiana 
we grow our business in two distinct ways 
first  we grow by adding new brands to our portfolio  either through new licenses or out right acquisitions of brands 
second  we grow through the creation of product line extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio 
every two to three years  we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio 
our business is not very capital intensive  and it is important to note that we do not own any manufacturing facilities 
rather  we act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers 
these components are received at one of our distribution centers and then  based upon production needs  the components are sent to one of several outside fillers which manufacture the finished good for us and ship it back to our distribution center 
important events burberry on october   we entered into a new long term fragrance license with burberry 
the agreement has a year term with an option to extend the license by an additional years subject to mutual agreement 
in addition  burberry has the right on december  and december  to buy back the license at its then fair market value 
this new agreement replaces the existing license 
the new royalty rates  which are approximately double the rates under the prior license  commenced as of july  the new advertising and promotional expenditures  which commenced on january   are substantially higher than under the prior license 
in anticipation of these new terms and to mitigate the associated expenses  we are fine tuning our operating model 
this new model includes increased selling prices to distributors  modified cost sharing arrangements with suppliers and distributors  and involves the future formation of joint ventures or company owned subsidiaries within key markets to handle future distribution 
while we anticipate a continued short term negative impact on our bottom line  particularly for the first half of  the growth potential offered by this international luxury brand makes us confident about our future long term prospects 
lanvin in june  inter parfums  sa entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with lanvin sa to create  develop and distribute fragrance lines under the lanvin brand name 
the fifteen year license agreement took effect july  and provided for an upfront non recoupable license fee of million  the purchase of existing inventory of million  and requires advertising expenditures and royalty payments in line with industry practice  as well as  the assumption of certain pre existing contractual obligations 
nickel in april inter parfums  sa acquired a interest in nickel sa for approximately million in cash including a capital infusion of million made in june  aggregating approximately million  net of cash acquired 
this marked our official entree into prestige skin care products 
we also own and operate men s spas in paris and new york  which sell our nickel products 
discussion of critical accounting policies we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these accounting policies generally require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies that we employ 
revenue recognition we sell our products to department stores  perfumeries  mass market retailers  supermarkets and domestic and international wholesalers and distributors 
sales of such products by our domestic subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars and sales of such products by our foreign subsidiaries are primarily denominated in either euros or us dollars 
accounts receivable reflect the granting of credit to these customers 
we generally grant credit based upon our analysis of the customer s financial position as well as previously established buying patterns 
generally  we do not bill customers for shipping and handling costs and  accordingly  we classify such costs as selling and administrative expenses 
we recognize revenues when merchandise is shipped and the risk of loss passes to the customer 
net sales are comprised of gross revenues less returns  and trade discounts and allowances 
sales returns generally  we do not permit customers to return their unsold products 
however  on a case by case basis we occasionally allow customer returns 
we regularly review and revise  as deemed necessary  our estimate of reserves for future sales returns based primarily upon historic trends and relevant current data 
we record estimated reserves for sales returns as a reduction of sales  cost of sales and accounts receivable 
returned products are recorded as inventories and are valued based upon estimated realizable value 
the physical condition and marketability of returned products are the major factors we consider in estimating realizable value 
actual returns  as well as estimated realizable values of returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates  if factors such as economic conditions  inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
promotional allowances we have various performance based arrangements with certain retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to our products 
these arrangements primarily allow customers to take deductions against amounts owed to us for product purchases 
estimated accruals for promotions and co operative advertising programs are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we review and revise the estimated accruals for the projected costs for these promotions 
actual costs incurred may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as the level and success of the retailers programs or other conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the cost of inventories based upon our sales forecast and the physical condition of the inventories 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
equipment and other long lived assets equipment  which includes tools and molds  is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital spending strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  or market acceptance of products  could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets  including trademarks  licenses and goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  then we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in consumer acceptance of our products 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of other long lived assets should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value after testing for impairment as described above  over the revised remaining useful life of such asset thereby increasing amortization expense 
results of operations net sales years ended december  in millions change change prestige product sales mass market product sales total net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
for the year ended december   net sales were up 
at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales rose and in and  respectively 
the increases in net sales are attributable to increases in our prestige product lines 
prestige product sales  which were up in  grew an additional in our calendar of product launches was most ambitious 
besides the continued geographic rollout of our launches of essence pure by st dupont and paul smith extreme  new brands and brand extensions made their debuts throughout the year 
in the spring of we launched a summer seasonal fragrances for both our celine and christian lacroix fragrance lines 
in addition  in late september  we launched a fragrance and cosmetic line under the diane von furstenberg label 
most importantly  the global rollout of burberry brit for women  which began in the third quarter of  expanded to asia  south america and the middle east in early in addition  during the third quarter of  the burberry brit men s line was launched in the uk  select countries in western europe and in the us 
the excellent performance of burberry london  burberry weekend  burberry touch  as well as the burberry brit collection all contributed to  and was the primary driver of  growth in prestige product sales 
the year also included several brand extensions 
during the second quarter of  we launched a limited edition warm weather seasonal fragrance for our celine and christian lacroix brands 
in july  we unveiled new fragrance families for both st dupont and paul smith and began distribution for lanvin products  our newest brand under license 
in early  we plan to introduce new christian lacroix and celine fragrance families 
in addition  our first new lanvin fragrance is under development in preparation for a late or early launch 
with respect to our mass market product lines  net sales were down in after rising in through june we continued to see growth in our fragrances lines as a result of our may acquisition of certain fragrance brands from tristar corporation  a debtor in possession  tristar 
tristar was one of our most significant competitors in mass market fragrances and the brands acquired are being sold in the same distribution channels as that of our other mass market fragrance lines 
after passing the one year anniversary of this acquisition  we began consolidating certain fragrance lines to reduce duplication and improve overall efficiency 
this resulted in a decline in mass market fragrance sales in however  new product line extensions and an expanding distribution network continued to benefit sales volume in our intimate health and beauty aids and our aziza cosmetics lines 
the decline in mass market product sales in is partially the result of a decline in us export sales primarily to customers in mexico and central and south america 
the economic environment in that area has been weak throughout and we have continued to closely monitor our credit risk in those territories and are willing to forego sales volume to minimize our overall credit exposure 
domestic sales in also showed signs of weakness and were also off for the year 
our new product development program for all of our product groups is well under way  and we expect to roll out new products throughout in addition  we are actively pursuing other new business opportunities 
however  we cannot assure you that any new license or acquisitions will be consummated 
as previously discussed  in april  inter parfums  sa acquired a interest in nickel sa nickel for approximately million in cash including an additional capital infusion of million made in june  aggregating approximately million  net of cash acquired 
net sales of nickel products for the period april  through december  aggregated million and net income for the same period was insignificant 
for the year ended march   prior to the acquisition  nickel generated net sales of approximately million 
also as discussed above  in june  inter parfums  sa entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with lanvin sa to create  develop and distribute fragrance lines under the lanvin brand name 
the fifteen year license agreement took effect july  for the six months period ended december   net sales of lanvin products aggregated approximately million 
in october  we entered into a new long term fragrance license with burberry 
this new agreement replaces the existing license and provides for an increase in the royalty rate effective as of july  and additional resources to be devoted to marketing commencing in in anticipation of these new terms and to mitigate the associated expenses  we are fine tuning our operating model 
this new model includes increased selling prices  modified cost sharing arrangements with suppliers and distributors  and involves the future formation of joint ventures or company owned subsidiaries within key markets 
while we anticipate a continued short term impact on our bottom line  particularly for the first half of  the growth potential offered by this international luxury brand makes us confident about our future long term prospects 
gross margins in millions years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin gross margin as a of net sales gross profit margins were in  in and in sales of products from our primarily french based prestige fragrance lines generate significantly higher gross profit margins than sales of our primarily united states based mass market product lines 
in  a decline of approximately in gross margin as a percentage of sales for united states mass market operations in was more than offset by an approximate improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales for our french based prestige product lines 
the balance of the margin improvement in was the result of the net sales growth rate achieved in prestige product lines  as compared to the negative growth rate of our mass market product lines 
in  there was no change in gross margin as a percentage of sales for united states mass market operations and a improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales for our french based prestige product lines 
the balance of the margin improvement in was the result of the net sales growth rate achieved in prestige product lines  as compared to the growth rate of our mass market product lines 
selling  general administrative in millions years ended december  selling  general administrative selling  general administrative as a of net sales selling  general and administrative expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to and for the year ended december   as compared to as a percentage of sales selling  general and administrative was  and of sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for is primarily the result of increased royalties required under our new license with burberry 
royalty expense  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  aggregated million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  growth in our prestige product lines requires higher selling  general and administrative expenses because promotion and advertising are prerequisites for sales of designer prestige products 
we develop a complete marketing and promotional plan to support our growing portfolio of prestige brands and to build upon each brand s awareness 
promotion and advertising included in selling  general and administrative expenses was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our mass market product lines do not require extensive advertising and therefore  more of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed rather than variable 
as previously reported  inter parfums  sa was a party to litigation with jean charles brosseau  sa brosseau  the owner of the ombre rose trademark 
in october  ipsa received notice of a judgment in favor of brosseau  which awarded damages of approximately million at current exchange rates 
on appeal  in february  the court required ipsa to pay million as an advance for damages claimed by brosseau 
in february  the court of appeal ordered inter parfums  sa to pay total damages of million of which million has already been advanced 
brosseau had until the end of may to appeal this decision 
no appeal has been filed  and therefore  in may  inter parfums  sa reversed its remaining litigation reserve aggregating approximately million 
this reversal is included as a reduction of administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
interest expense aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we use the credit lines available to us  as needed  to finance our working capital needs and short term financing for acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisition of the lanvin license referred to above  inter parfums  sa financed the license fee by entering into a million five year credit agreement 
in order to reduce exposure to rising variable interest rates  inter parfums  sa entered into a swap transaction effectively exchanging the variable interest rate referred to above to a variable rate based on the month euribor rate with a floor of and a ceiling of 
this fair value of this derivative instrument at december  is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and an expense of million has been recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency gains or losses aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments 
our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rates differ from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions which are slightly higher than those in the united states 
no significant changes in tax rates were experienced nor were any expected in jurisdictions where we operate 
net income increased to million in after increasing to million in diluted earnings per share increased to in after increasing to in weighted average shares outstanding aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  average shares outstanding were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the average diluted shares outstanding is the result of the effect of dilutive securities resulting from an increase in our average stock price 
the average stock price of our common shares was per share for the year ended december   as compared to per share for the year ended december liquidity and financed resources our financial position remains strong 
at december   working capital aggregated million and we had a working capital ratio of to cash and cash equivalents aggregated million 
in april  inter parfums  sa acquired a interest in nickel for approximately million in cash including an additional capital infusion of million made in june  aggregating approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we funded this acquisition with cash on hand 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  each of the minority shareholders has an option to put their remaining interest in nickel to inter parfums  sa from january through june based on an independent valuation  management has valued the put options at million as of the date of acquisition 
these options are carried at fair value as determined by management as of december   which resulted in a gain of million 
the purchase price for the minority shares will be based upon a formula applied to nickel s sales for the year ending december   pro rated for the minority holders equity in nickel or at a price approximately above the recent purchase price 
in june  inter parfums  sa entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with lanvin to create  develop and distribute fragrance lines under the lanvin brand name 
the fifteen year license agreement takes effect july  and provided for an upfront license fee of million and the purchase of existing inventory of million 
inter parfums  sa financed the license fee by entering into a million five year credit agreement 
this long term credit facility  which bears interest at above the eurobor rate  provides for principal to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of million and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
in october  inter parfums  sa entered into a new long term fragrance license with burberry 
this new agreement replaces the existing license and provides for an increase in the royalty rate effective as of july  and additional resources to be devoted to marketing commencing in in connection with the new license agreement inter parfums  sa paid burberry an upfront license fee of approximately million 
cash provided by used in operating activities aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   in terms of cash flows  accounts receivable and inventories were up and  respectively  from december  the increase in accounts receivable and inventories is reasonable considering that net sales for the three months and year ended december  were up and  respectively 
in addition  a significant inventory build up during the fourth quarter of was made to meet our sales commitments in early including the continued rollout of our burberry brit for women line 
this buildup was financed primarily through normal credit terms with our vendors  and therefore did not have any significant impact on our cash flows from operations 
the inventory buildup financed through normal credit terms from our vendors is the most significant factor affecting our cash flow from operating activities in as our vendors needed to get paid 
changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses provided cash from operating activities in of million and used cash of million in in addition  cash used in operating activities for reflects an increase in accounts receivable of million 
this increase  which represents a increase from the december  accounts receivable balance  is reasonable considering the company s sales growth of and for the three months and year ended december   respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities consists of approximately million spent on tools and molds with the balance of capital expenditures representing office fixtures  computer equipment and industrial equipment needed at our distribution centers 
for the year ended december   cash flows used in investing activities aggregated million 
included in this amount is approximately million paid for the purchase of the lanvin license including legal expenses and fees  million paid for the nickel acquisition  net of cash acquired and million paid to burberry in connection with the signing of a new license agreement 
in march  our board of directors increased the cash dividend to 
per share  approximately million per annum  payable 
per share on a quarterly basis 
our first cash dividend of 
per share is to be paid on april  to shareholders of record on march  dividends paid  including dividends paid to minority shareholders by our french subsidiary aggregated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this increased cash dividend in represents a small part of our cash position and is not expected to have any significant impact on our financial position 
our short term financing requirements are expected to be met by available cash at december   cash generated by operations and short term credit lines provided by domestic and foreign banks 
the principal credit facilities for consist of a million unsecured revolving line of credit provided by a domestic commercial bank and approximately million in credit lines provided by a consortium of international financial institutions 
actual borrowings under these facilities have been minimal as we typically use our working capital to finance all of our cash needs 
we believe that funds generated from operations  supplemented by our present cash position and available credit facilities  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet all present and reasonably foreseeable future operating needs 
inflation rates in the us and foreign countries in which we operate did not have a significant impact on operating results for the year ended december contractual obligations the following table sets for a schedule of our contractual obligations over the periods indicated in the table  as well as our total contractual obligations in thousands 
payments due by period total less than years years more than contractual obligations year years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating leases      purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap minimum royalty obligations      total      item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that primarily consists of the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not engage in the trading of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk management we periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency 
we enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of inter parfums  sa  our french subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 
all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions  which are rated as strong investment grade 
all derivative instruments are required to be reflected as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  then the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
before entering into a derivative transaction for hedging purposes  we determine that the change in the value of the derivative will effectively offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item from a movement in foreign currency rates 
then  we measure the effectiveness of each hedge throughout the hedged period 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement 
we believe that our risk of loss as the result of nonperformance by any of such financial institutions is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding one year 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts at inter parfums  sa in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of approximately us million and gb pounds million 
interest rate risk management we mitigate interest rate risk by continually monitoring interest rates  and then determining whether fixed interest rates should be swapped for floating rate debt  or if floating rate debt should be swapped for fixed rate debt 
we have entered into one interest rate swap to reduce exposure to rising variable interest rates  by effectively exchanging the variable interest rate of above the three month euribor rate on our long term to a variable rate based on the month euribor rate with a floor of and a ceiling of 
the fair value of this derivative instrument at december  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and an expense of million has been recorded in our consolidated statement of operations
