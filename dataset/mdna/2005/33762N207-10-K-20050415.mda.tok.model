no assurance can be given that we will be immune to this trend 
if the product cycle for our systems proves to be shorter than management anticipates  our pricing structure and revenues could be impaired 
in addition  in order to remain competitive  we may be required to expend a greater percentage of our revenues on product innovation and development than has historically been the case

see certain factors affecting forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report 
compared to revenue total revenues  which include software license fees  services  and maintenance revenues  decreased from  in to  in due to decreases in software and services revenues

although we have renewed our relationships with distributors in australia and look forward to activity from these distributors  there has been limited activity thus far 
services revenues decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to decreased services revenue from eds 
although we successfully completed implementation of the multi year services project for eds during  we continued to provide limited additional services to this customer in our services revenues have decreased from levels because the services revenues we derived from the multi year contract have not been replaced with other customer accounts 
our services revenues are subject to fluctuations based on variations in the length of and number of active service engagements in a given quarter 
maintenance revenues increased from  in to  in the increase is due to a full year of maintenance revenue from the connect care acquisition and additional maintenance revenues associated with new customers net of cancellations from existing customers 
maintenance revenues are the result of renewal agreements from previous software license agreements as well as new license agreements 
revenues from non monetary exchanges are recorded at the fair value of the products and services provided or received  whichever is more clearly evident

the designation of official crm supplier and other sponsorship benefits supports the company s marketing strategy and brand awareness efforts 
firstwave has an official designation with the rugby football union  the arena football league  the atlanta sports council  the chick fil a peach bowl and ise hospitality 
within the sports industry  sponsorships are a common tool for a company to promote its goods and or services with a popular organization or event 
these types of designations provide two primary benefits 
first  the company receives recognition in the general marketing and advertising that the organization or event executes  thereby helping to promote and identify our brand in the market 
as a sponsor  we receive advertising and logo placement within event programs  on site signage such as field boards  and additional forms of awareness opportunities 
in addition  we are able to capitalize upon our relationship with these organizations through the use of their marks and logos in our marketing materials

a net realizable analysis of capitalized software development costs was performed as of december  in accordance with sfas accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
based on the results of the analysis  we determined that the carrying amount of the unamortized capitalized software costs does not exceed their net realizable value  therefore  no impairment loss was recorded 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in primarily due to decreases in payroll and employee benefit costs  partially offset by an increase in rent expense related to an expense for abandoned office space of  and by a reserve of  for surplus third party products 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested periodically for impairment 
examples of management s judgment regarding the existence of impairment of an intangible asset and the resulting fair value  would include management s estimates of future net cash flows and assessment of adverse changes in legal factors  market conditions  or loss of key personnel 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is determined to be less than the carrying value  the company would record an impairment loss 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase approach for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
goodwill was evaluated at year end for impairment during the fourth quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
the fair value was estimated using the expected net present value of future cash flows 
it was determined there was no instance of impairment of recorded goodwill 
therefore  the second phase of the testing was not required 
during the first quarter of  based on lower than expected operating results  the company re evaluated the assumptions utilized at year end and revised the anticipated future earnings projections

the strategies for transitioning our revenue stream away from dependence on a few large customers include acquisition of companies with customer bases bringing in recurring maintenance revenues and a potential for upgrade licenses and services revenues 
the connect care acquisition of march  was the first such acquisition to help diversify our revenue stream 
we are also focusing on vertical markets to increase the prospects in our pipeline with targeted companies for our solutions 
our vertical markets include high tech companies and sports associations

software development costs capitalized software development costs consist principally of salaries  contract services  and certain other expenses related to development and modifications of software products capitalized in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of such costs begins only upon establishment of technological feasibility as defined in sfas and ends when the resulting product is available for sale 
the company evaluates the establishment of technological feasibility based on the existence of a working model of the software product 
capitalized costs may include costs related to product enhancements resulting in new features and increased functionality as well as writing the code in a new programming language 
since version enhancements are built on an already detailed design under an existing source code  technological feasibility is established early for each version 
all costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software products are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
the company evaluates the realizability of unamortized capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date 
software development costs which are capitalized are subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
if the unamortized capitalized software cost exceeds the net realizable value of the asset  the amount would be written off accordingly 
the net realizable value of the capitalized software development costs is the estimated future gross revenues of the software product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
amortization of capitalized software costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is not more than three years 
it is possible that those estimates of anticipated product revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or both could be reduced due to changing technologies 
the amortization of software development costs is presented as a cost of software revenue in the company s financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  a decision to no longer market one product and discontinue development of two other products  resulted in a write off of  of previously capitalized software development costs which is reflected in cost of software revenue in the company s consolidated financial statements

table of contents quarterly financial data unaudited the table below sets forth certain unaudited operating results for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
our operating results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
quarter ended in thousands  except per share amounts net revenues operating income loss net income loss net income loss applicable to common shareholders basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share total revenues decreased from  in the fourth quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of due to decreases in software and services revenues 
the primary cause of the decrease in total revenues is due to lower revenues from our relationship with electronic data systems  ltd 
eds which contributed of total revenues during  compared to of total revenues for our software revenues are significantly dependent upon the size and timing of closing of license agreements and our services revenues are subject to fluctuations based on length and number of active engagements in a given quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
currently  the company maintains its cash position primarily in money market funds and other bank accounts 
the company does not currently engage in hedging activities or otherwise use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its financial assets 
although a decrease in interest rates could reduce our interest income  management does not believe a change in interest rates will materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations in 
table of contents the company had a variable interest rate on its line of credit  which accrued interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
due to the amount of the borrowings and the short term nature of the debt  we did not have a significant risk due to potential fluctuations in interest rates for loans during changes in interest rates could make it more costly to borrow money in the future and may impede our future acquisition and growth strategies if management determines that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
the results of operations of firstwave technologies  uk ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary located in surrey  england  are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of this subsidiary are translated from the local currency to us dollars upon consolidation 
because of the significance of the operations of this subsidiary to our consolidated operations  as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from our prior performance and our expectations 
in addition  because of the significance of our overseas operations  we could also be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products and further negatively impact the results of our operations in a material and adverse manner 
as a result of these market risks  the price of our stock could decline significantly and rapidly 
the company manages the risk by monitoring on a regular basis the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as they relate to our uk subsidiary  and attempts to take action if the foreign currency exchange rate would result in a material impact to the company s financial statements upon translation from the local currency  the british pound  to the us dollar 
the action taken in these instances by the company is to move the currency from the uk subsidiary to the company s headquarters when doing so would be beneficial to the company 
the foreign currency that the company transfers to the united states comes from the operations of the uk subsidiary in the normal course of business 
the uk subsidiary has recognized of the revenues generated by the company in  and collected the payments for those revenues 
after covering the expenses to operate the subsidiary  the company has had excess currency in the uk 
these transactions are not economic hedges of a net investment in the uk subsidiary and are not intercompany transactions of a long term nature 
the cash payments from the uk subsidiary to the us parent are payments against a short term intercompany account 
the intercompany account represents items owed to the us parent for royalty charges and intercompany charges assessed on the uk subsidiary 
these items are intercompany in nature and are eliminated in the consolidation of the company s financial statements 
cash payments against the intercompany balance are made regularly by the uk subsidiary to the us parent 
the company tries to time the actual payments from the uk subsidiary to the us parent to occur when the currency exchange rate of british pounds to us dollars is strong  thus yielding favorable conversion results 
the intercompany account charges are denominated in uk currency  converted to us dollars  and eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the exchange risk to the company is if the exchange rate decreases  the carrying value of the intercompany balance decreases and results in a charge against income 
the tax consequences of this intercompany activity are that the us parent recognizes income on the us corporate tax return for the intercompany charges assessed on the uk subsidiary 
we do not engage in any hedging activities 
as foreign currency exchange rates vary  the fluctuations in revenues and expenses may materially impact the financial statements upon consolidation 
a weaker us dollar would result in an increase to revenues and expenses upon consolidation  and a stronger us dollar would result in a decrease to revenues and expenses upon consolidation
