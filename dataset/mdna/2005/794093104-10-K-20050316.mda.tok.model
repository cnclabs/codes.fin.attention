item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of selected assets of radio stations and our acquisition of selected assets of other media businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under item for additional information 
overview as a radio broadcasting company with a national radio network  we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
historically  our principal sources of revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
the rates we are able to charge for broadcast time and advertising time are dependent upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the number of stations in the market as well as the number of stations in the market in our format that are competing for the same listeners  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
our sources of revenue and product offerings also include other media businesses  including the internet and magazine publishing 
the following table shows gross broadcasting revenue  the percentage of gross broadcasting revenue for each broadcasting revenue source and net broadcasting revenue 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials srn other gross broadcasting revenue less agency commissions net broadcasting revenue our broadcasting revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers 
historically we have not subscribed to traditional audience measuring services 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audiences 
in selected markets we subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our network has a general pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds generally with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually 
our cash flow is affected by a transition period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial to change its format 
this transition period is when we develop a radio station s customer and listener base 
during this period  a station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as other media advertising  travel or lodging in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii promotional expenses and iv music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions of radio stations and existing and future borrowings 
salem web network  our internet business  earns its revenue from sales of streaming services  sales of banner advertising and sponsorships on the internet  and  to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
salem publishing  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as other media on our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
same station definition in the discussion of our results of operations below  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
with regard to fiscal quarters  we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the quarter  as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year 
same station results for a full year are based on the sum of the same station results for the four quarters of that year 
results of operations we have reclassified our statements of operations data for all periods presented to reflect our sale on september   of the assets of radio station wygy fm  which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation

we define station operating income soi as net broadcasting revenue less broadcasting operating expenses 
soi is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  as a result it should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that soi is a useful non gaap financial measure to investors  when considered in conjunction with operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  our management uses soi as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability 
soi does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
our soi is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

soi increased million or to million in from million in as a percentage of net broadcasting revenue  soi increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to the effect of radio stations acquired during and that previously operated with formats other than their current format and the effect of the growth of our contemporary christian music format 
acquired and reformatted radio stations typically produce low margins during the first few years following conversion

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and long term debt and debt covenant compliance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies which affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets most of our radio station acquisitions have been acquisitions of selected assets and not of businesses 
such asset acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the fcc license 
it is our policy to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or other media properties under consideration for acquisition 
the allocations assigned to acquired fcc licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports which assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or other media properties at the close of the transaction 
from time to time we undertake projects to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs up to the point where the project is complete  at which point we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
in certain cases where a project s completion is contingent upon fcc or other regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the event the required approval is not considered probable  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets under the financial accounting standards board s rules  sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  but perform annual impairment tests in accordance with these statements 
we believe our fcc licenses have indefinite lives and accordingly amortization expense is no longer recorded for our fcc licenses as well as our goodwill 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we perform an annual test of impairment on our fcc licenses and our goodwill 
these tests include comparing the recorded values to the appraised values  calculations of discounted cash flows  operating income and other analyses 
as of december   based on our application of the impairment rules  no impairment was recorded 
the assessment of the fair values of these assets and the underlying businesses are estimates which require careful consideration and judgments by our management 
if conditions in the markets in which that our stations and other media businesses operate or if the operating results of our stations and other media businesses change or fail to develop as anticipated  our estimates of the fair values may change in the future and result in impairment charges 
valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of our borrowings under our credit facility as long term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the borrowing restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments will be required pursuant to the credit agreement 
these projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors 
accordingly  these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates 
should our actual results differ materially from these estimates  payments may become due under our credit facility or it may become necessary to seek an amendment to our credit facility 
based on our management s current assessment  we do not anticipate principal payments becoming due under our credit facility or a further amendment of our credit facility becoming necessary

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand  proceeds from our debt and equity offerings  borrowings under the credit facility and operating cash flow 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes from operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
we actively monitor these fluctuations and use derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk

at december   an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million was outstanding 
this agreement related to our million notes 
this agreement was scheduled to expire in when the notes mature  and effectively swapped the fixed interest rate on million of the notes for a floating rate equal to the libor rate plus 
the estimated fair value of this swap agreement and the excess of fair value over the book value of the debt hedged by the swap  based on current market rates  were each million at december  changes in the fair value of the swap and the changes in the fair value of debt being hedged are recorded as part of interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreement is included with long term assets  and the fair value of the debt hedged by the swap is recorded in long term debt consistent with the maturity date of the swap and related debt 
because this fair value hedge was effective that is  the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument was designed to be equal to the change in the fair value of the item being hedged  there was no income statement effect relative to the change in the fair value of the swap agreement 
interest expense for the year ended december  was reduced by million as a result of the difference between the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt and the floating interest rate under the swap agreement  which was for the six month period ended june  and was for the six month period ending december  on february   we sold our entire interest in this swap and received a payment of approximately million  which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
we had a second interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million 
this agreement also related to our notes 
this agreement was to expire in when the notes mature  and effectively swapped the fixed interest rate on million of the notes for a floating rate equal to the libor rate plus 
on august   we sold our interest in million of this swap 
as a result of this transaction  we paid and capitalized million in buyout premium which will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
on october   we sold our remaining million interest in this swap 
as a result of this second transaction  we paid and capitalized million in buyout premium which will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
we recognized approximately  in interest expense related to the amortization of capitalized buyout premium for the year ended december  because this fair value hedge was effective that is  the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument was designed to be equal to the change in the fair value of the item being hedged  there was no income statement effect relative to the change in the fair value of the swap agreement 
interest expense for the year ended december  was reduced by million as a result of the difference between the fixed interest rate on our debt and the floating interest rate under the swap agreement  which was for the six months ended june  and was for the six month period ending december  market risk in addition to the interest rate swap agreements discussed above under derivative instruments  borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to market risk exposure  specifically to changes in libor and in the prime rate in the united states 
as of september   we had borrowed million under the credit facilities 
as of december   we could borrow up to an additional million under the credit facilities 
amounts outstanding under the credit facilities bear interest at a base rate  at our option  of the banks prime rate or libor  plus a spread 
for purposes of determining the interest rate under the revolving credit facilities  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
as of december   the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facilities was 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in the prime rate or libor  as applicable  would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis 
in addition to the variable rate debt disclosed above  we have fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million relating to the outstanding notes and the notes as of december   with an aggregate fair value of million 
we are exposed to changes in the fair value of these financial instruments based on changes in the market rate of interest on this debt 
the ultimate value of these notes will be determined by actual market prices  as all of these notes are tradable 
we estimate that a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair value of the notes to approximately million and a hypothetical basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in the increase of the fair value of the notes to approximately million
