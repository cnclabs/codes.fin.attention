item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of the company 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
it should also be read in conjunction with the caution about forward looking statements section at the end of this discussion 
overview the company is headquartered in middleburg  virginia and conducts its primary operations through three wholly owned subsidiaries  the bank  tredegar and gpia 
the bank is a community bank serving western loudoun county and northern fairfax county  virginia with six full service branches and one limited service facility 
tredegar is a trust company headquartered in richmond  virginia with a branch office in middleburg  virginia 
gpia is a registered investment advisor headquartered in alexandria  virginia serving clients in states 
the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and the quality of the assets 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
the bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
tredegar and gpia generate fee income from providing investment management and trust services to its clients 
investment management and trust fees are generally based upon the value of assets und er management  and  therefore can be significantly affected by fluctuation in the values of securities caused by changes in the capital markets 
in  the company continued to realize the benefit of high growth rates in both assets and net interest income 
by december   total assets reached million  an increase of 
total assets at december  were million 
loans  net of unearned income  grew from million at december  to million at december  this is the largest single year increase in portfolio loans in the past years 
considering the current interest rate environment  the company has been cautious about the amount and type of loan growth it has added to the loan portfolio 
additional staff  a solid local economy and the relationship with southern trust contributed to the strong loan growth experienced 
total deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  low cost d eposits  including demand checking  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  continue to drive much of the growth in deposits 
the net interest margin declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decline is attributed to both the lower yields earned on new loan growth during a period of low interest rates and the company s increased reliance on borrowed money to fund the earning asset growth 
the net interest margin compression of basis points experienced in the first quarter of was offset slightly by strong earning asset growth thus providing a increase in net interest income 
results for were also favorably affected by the growth in revenues from tredegar s fiduciary fees and from the bank s investment in bank owned life insurance boli 
non interest expenses grew at a rate of for the year compared to expense related to regulatory compliance and branchi ng efforts contributed to this increase for because of the company s plans for growth and expansion  it is expected that non interest expense growth rates may exceed this level in the future 
the company remains well capitalized with risk adjusted core capital and total capital ratios well above the regulatory minimums 
asset quality measures also remained consistently strong throughout the year 
the loan loss provision increased primarily due to loan growth 
the company plans to expand the integration of tredegar  gpia and the bank s investment services department into a more focused wealth management program for all of the company s clients 
also  through the affiliation with southern trust  the bank plans to continue to increase its loan portfolio by purchasing high credit quality  low loan to value first deeds of trusts on residential property 
the bank plans to continue its focus on low cost deposit growth with advertising campaigns that target potential clients affected by recent bank mergers 
management has developed a branching strategy that includes expansion into warrenton  virginia fauquier county in june  and sterling  virginia loudoun county in late other markets under consideration include herndon and chantilly loudoun county 
management will look for key lenders in those market s to join the bank s team to generate earning assets and awareness prior to the branch opening 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities that  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
recent financial developments in february  the company executed a lease for a facility in warrenton  virginia 
the lease has an original term of years  commencing march   and a minimum annual rent of  which will increase three percent per annum on each march st during the original lease term 
the company has four options to renew the lease beyond the initial term  each of which is for a period of five years 
the warrenton financial services center opening is tentatively planned for the second quarter of the company has already hired several staff members and loan officers to serve this market 
the reston bank branch  opened in november and consists of one story building of brick construction with approximately  square feet of floor space  located at fountain drive  reston  virginia  the office is a full service branch with three double stack drive up facilities and a drive up automated teller machine 
the bank owns this branch building but leases the land upon which it resides 
the initial term of the lease is years with two five year renewal options 
the annual lease expense associated with this location is  during  the company purchased million of bank owned life insurance boli 
this investment is reflected in the other asset section of the company s balance sheet 
the company purchased boli to help offset increasing employee benefit costs 
on april   the bank acquired a interest in southern trust 
upon the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust  the bank s existing mortgage operation was assumed by southern trust 
in connection with the southern trust investment  the bank entered into two loan participation agreements with southern trust 
one arrangement is a tri party agreement among the bank  southern trust and colonial bank  southern trust s warehouse line lender 
the agreement details the arrangements by which the bank purchases of selected loans from colonial bank 
the bank charges southern trust a rate equal to the one month libor rate at the time of purchase plus basis points 
as noted in the tri party agreement  the bank does not intend to hold the purchased loans more than days  colonial bank maintains the note documentation on behalf of the bank  and the bank will engage semi annual testing to be conducted by a third party to validate colonial bank procedures 
at december   the balance of the bank s participated mortgages held for sale was million 
the tri party agreement is capped at million 
the bank also entered into a construction loan participation agreement with southern trust 
according to this agreement  the bank can purchase of selected construction loans and draws  up to million in outstanding balances and million in commitments 
the bank will charge southern trust an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus basis points on the outstanding participated loans held by the bank 
adjustments in rate related to movements in the prime rate will be made monthly 
there were million in outstanding construction participation loans at december  the company exercised its option to buy gpia in april the terms of the transaction included a total purchase price of million with  common shares of the company issued to the shareholders of gpia 
at the time of acquisition  gpia had approximately million of assets under management with clients in states 
clients who are located in washington  dc  maryland and virginia account for approximately of the assets under management 
assets under management by both tredegar and gpia were approximately billion at december  critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon the accounting policies of the company 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses the bank monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the bank maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan and lease portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due by days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans and leases  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loans and lease losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan and lease losses of the bank as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the bank recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
intangibles and goodwill the bank has approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill at december   a decrease of  since december  on april   the bank acquired gpia  a registered investment advisor  for million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with this investment  a purchase price valuation using fas and as a guideline was completed to determine the appropriate allocation to identified intangibles 
the valuation concluded that approximately of the purchase price was related to the acquisition of customer relationships with an amortizable life of years 
another of the purchase price was allocated to a non compete agreement with an amortizable life of years 
the remainder of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill 
approximately million of the million in intangible assets and goodwill at december  is attributable to the company s investment in tredegar 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the life span of various customer relationships as well as the value that key members of management add to the success of the bank 
for example  customer attrition rates were determined based upon assumptions that the past five years may predict the future 
if the actual attrition rates  among other assumptions  differed from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require an acceleration in the amortization expense 
in addition  fas requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
processes and procedures have been identified for the two step process 
when the bank completes its ongoing review of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill  factors that are considered important to determining whether an impairment might exist include loss of customers acquired or significant withdrawals of the assets currently under management and or early retirement or termination of key members of management 
any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations

the roa for the company decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the decrease in roa in is the result of increases in capital expenditures related to the bank s branching strategy

net interest income net interest income represents the principal source of earnings of the company 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december  this is an increase of over the million reported for the same period in net interest income for increased over the million reported for the increase in net interest income in resulted primarily from the growth in average earning assets

this directive coupled with lower number of security purchases throughout have impacted the overall investment portfolio yield 
the average loan portfolio volume increased during conversely  the average yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points 
growth in the loan portfolio helped offset the decline in loan yields to produce a increase in loan interest income 
loan demand continues to remain strong and the bank has added commercial lenders in markets in which the bank opened new facilities and markets in which the bank plans to build branches 
the average balance of low cost interest bearing accounts interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts grew to million at december  the cost of such funding decreased basis points during the year ended december  the average balances in certificates of deposit decreased  while the interest expense associated with these deposits decreased or  the company s reliance on other funding sources  such as the federal home loan bank overnight advances  increased on average by million with a related increase in interest expense of only  during  the company increased its average long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank by million 
much of the increase in borrowings was related to the funding the growth experienced in the bank s loan portfolio total interest expense for was million  a increase of  compared to the total interest expense for with the anticipation of rising interest rates and a continued reliance on borrowings to fund the company s asset growth  interest expense is expected to increase 
management expects that the net interest margin will remained relatively unchanged during based on conservative internal interest rate risk models and the assumption of a sustained rising rate environment  the company expects net interest income to trend downward slightly throughout the next months as mortgage related assets extend and funding costs rise quickly 
the expected decrease to net interest income could be as little as 
or  in a month period of rising rates of basis points 
it is anticipated that increased growth in earning assets will help mitigate the above mentioned impact to the company s net interest margin 
the asset liability management committee continues to focus on various strategies to maintain the net interest margin 
the increase in net interest income in resulted from the growth in average earning assets 
the basis point decrease in earning assets yield was offset somewhat by a basis point decrease in the cost of funding 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to 
the average balance in the securities portfolio increased by million while the tax equivalent yield decreased basis points to 
the average loan portfolio volume increased during conversely  the average yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points

the company is committed to making loan loss provisions that maintain an allowance that adequately reflects the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
this commitment is more fully discussed in the asset quality section below 
non interest income non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for increasing profitability 
management recognizes this and continues to review and consider areas where non interest income can be increased 
non interest income excluding securities gains and losses includes fees generated by the mortgage banking and investment sales departments of the bank as well as by tredegar and gpia 
non interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for during and for the first four months of  mortgage banking income and certain loan fees related to mortgage banking were reported on a gross income basis 
all expenses of that department were reported within non interest expenses 
all earnings of that department after april  are being reported as equity in earnings from affiliate  following the transfer of the bank s mortgage banking department to southern trust 
equity in earnings from affiliate of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively  is the result of the interest in southern trust 
the equity earnings in southern trust added 
per diluted share after tax for the year ended december  in  southern trust closed million in loans with of that production attributable to purchase money financing 
total construction loan closings were million for the year ended december  southern trust expects that production attributable to refinancings  which have leveled off  will continue to decrease slightly in the first quarter of this production decrease  and any decreases associated with the seasonality of home sales  are expected to be offset somewhat by an increase in purchase money financings and new construction loans 
service charges  which include both deposit fees and certain loan fees  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  investment advisory fees of million for the year ended december  are from gpia 
investment advisory fees increased in compared to investment advisory fee balance

tredegar produced fiduciary fees that increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in assets under administration at tredegar grew or million to million at december  fiduciary fees are also based primarily upon the market value of the accounts under administration 
investment sales fees decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  a strategic decision was made to change the broker dealer clearing provider in the investment services department 
for a period of time after the system conversion  the investment services department had only two financial consultants down from five during the first nine months of this has significantly impacted the level of revenue generated by the department when comparing the year over year results 
the company now has five financial consultants working inside each of the branches 
trust fee income increased during to million 
a significant portion of trust fees are based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets under management  so any increases in market value of the assets under management result in a similar increase in fees 
tredegar s accounts are typically invested in equities with a smaller allocation to fixed income securities 
the continued recovery in equity market values and the growth in assets under management have contributed to the growth in the fees 
gpia s investment advisory fees added million to non interest income for like tredegar  their fees are based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets under management  however gpia s clients have substantially more invested in fixed income securities 
the fixed income market experienced significant fluctuations throughout  ultimately causing marginal growth in fees in spite of good business development 
during  service charges  which include both deposit fees and certain loan fees  increased to million 
during  the company realized  in net gains as a result of restructuring the investment portfolio in response to the change in the interest rate environment in total non interest income for was million  compared to million for non interest income for increased to million from million in the increase is due primarily to the increase on fees on loans held for sale  investment advisory fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
due to historic low mortgage rates and increased refinancings  the mortgage banking department contributed an additional  of fees on loans held for sale during the service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts increased during the increase in these fees was due primarily to a increase in transaction oriented deposit account growth 
noninterest income years ended december in thousands service charges  commissions and fees trust fee income investment advisory fee income fees on loans held for sale commission on investment sales equity earnings in affiliate other operating income non interest income gains losses on securities available for sale  net total non interest income non interest expense non interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for included in other operating expenses were some one time costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  supplemental executive retirement benefits  and equity adjustments for ownership in banker s investment  the company s broker dealer

in february of  the company executed a lease for a facility in warrenton  virginia 
the lease has an original term of years  commencing march   and a minimal annual rent of  which will increase three percent per annum on each march st during the original lease term 
the company has four options to renew the lease beyond the initial term  each of which is for a period of five years

advertising expense increased in to  during the first half of  the company conducted a campaign that was targeted specifically to grow checking accounts 
computer operations expense increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase is related to both the increased cost of computer related maintenance contracts and the increased number of the company s clients utilizing its online banking services and the increase in volume of online banking transactions 
clients meeting specific criteria are provided free online banking services by the company 
it is expected that non interest expenses will increase at a faster pace in some of the increase will be associated with costs related to having additional facilities in and obtaining additional staffing to support branching growth and additional business development goals 
total non interest expenses increased or million to million in additions to staff to support business development  branching and the formation of a wealth management group have contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits during the growth in salary expense was a marginal during because the commissions and salary expense related mortgage banking were reported within the equity earnings from affiliate after april  if the mortgage banking department of the bank remained within the bank after the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust  salary and benefit expense would have been approximately  higher or increased year over year 
net occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the building expansion program  which includes the operations center and the second leesburg branch  continued to affect net occupancy and equipment expense year over year 
advertising expense decreased in to  because the bank focused more on in branch promotions and business development calling to increase sales rather than paid advertising 
computer operations expense includes fees paid to a third party vendor for online banking services 
the online banking fees increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in other increases in computer operations relate to increases in support and maintenance fees paid to the application software and hardware vendors 
non interest expenses increased or million to million in this increase resulted from both pressures to provide competitive salary and benefit programs and occupancy and equipment investments to position the bank for future growth and productivity

non farm  non residential real estate loans are typically owner occupied commercial buildings 
non farm  non residential loans were of the total loan portfolio at december  the increase in the non farm non residential real estate loans is the result of both a strong image advertising campaign during and the hiring of several commercial business development officers during and each of whom have been successful in attracting new business to the bank

the company s market area for its lending services encompasses fairfax  fauquier and loudoun counties  where it operates full service branches 
the company s unfunded loan commitments totaled million at december  and million at december  the increase in the amount of unfunded commitments is attributed in part to the increase in real estate construction financing as well as customer demand for credit line products  primarily home equity lines 
at december   the company had no concentration of loans in any one industry in excess of of its total loan portfolio

total non performing assets  which consist of non accrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed property  were  at december  this is a decrease of  from the december  balance of  the majority of the decrease resulted from the pay off of a residential real estate loan 
non performing assets were million at december  non performing assets loans are placed on non accrual status when collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses be charged against earnings 
for real estate loans  upon foreclosure  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair market value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends

the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions that they may have in prior years or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends 
additionally  the proportion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount that may be available for the future losses that could occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the total portfolio

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this standard requires classification of investments into three categories  held to maturity htm  available for sale afs  or trading  as further defined in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company does not maintain a trading account and has classified no securities in this category 
htm securities are required to be carried on the financial statements at amortized cost 
afs securities are carried on the financial statements at fair value 
the unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  are reflected in shareholders equity 
the htm classification places restrictions on the company s ability to sell securities or to transfer securities into the afs classification 
since the company desires the flexibility to respond to changing balance sheet needs through investment portfolio management  it has chosen to classify only a small portion of its portfolio in this category 
at december   of the portfolio was classified as htm 
the company holds in its loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in prime lending rate 
these holdings are not considered speculative but instead necessary for good asset liability management 
the carrying value of the securities portfolio was million at december   a decrease of million or from the carrying value of million at december  the market value of the afs securities at december  was million 
the unrealized loss on the afs securities was million at december  this loss was offset by the december  unrealized gain of million 
the net market value gain at december  is reflective of the continued low level of market interest rates 
the net unrealized gain on the afs securities was million at december  since the bank anticipates much of the balance sheet growth to be experienced during  if any  to be in the form of net portfolio loans  specific strategies will be executed during the early part of to maintain the investment portfolio at an amount comparable to the december  balances 
because net loan growth is anticipated to come in at a faster rate during the beginning of than the later part of the year  an investment strategy is intended to be executed in order to increase the amount of earning assets for the bank

deposits deposits continue to be an important funding source and primary supply of the company s growth 
the company s strategy has been to increase its core deposits at the same time that it is controlling its cost of funds 
the maturation of the branch network  as well as increased advertising campaigns and bank mergers  have contributed to the significant growth in deposits over the last several years 
by monitoring interest rates within the local market and that of alternative funding sources  the company is able to price the deposits effectively to develop a core base of deposits in each branch

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and interest rate swaps 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the bank has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties

those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the bank is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

capital resources and dividends the company has an ongoing strategic objective of maintaining a capital base that supports the pursuit of profitable business opportunities  provides resources to absorb risks inherent in its activities and meets or exceeds all regulatory requirements 
the federal reserve board has established minimum regulatory capital standards for bank holding companies and state member banks 
the regulatory capital standards categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four categories that weigh balance sheet assets according to risk  requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  composed of common equity and retained earnings 
the company had a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of and at december  and  respectively

federal regulatory agencies impose certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and the transfer of assets from the banking subsidiaries to the holding company 
historically  these restrictions have not had an adverse impact on the company s dividend policy  and it is not anticipated that they will in the future

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
an entity is deemed a variable interest entity  subject to the interpretation  if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or in cases in which the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  which include the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights  the obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
due to significant implementation issues  the fasb modified the wording of fin and issued fin r in december of fin r deferred the effective date for the provisions of fin to entities other than special purpose entities spes until financial statements issued for periods ending after march  spes were subject to the provisions of either fin or fin r as of december  management has evaluated the company s investments in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in trust preferred securities structures because these entities or transactions constitute the company s primary fin and fin r exposure 
the adoption of fin and fin r did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the scope of the sop applies to unhealthy problem loans that have been acquired  either individually in a portfolio  or in a business acquisition 
the sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
the sop does not apply to loans originated by the company 
the company intends to adopt the provisions of sop effective january   and does not expect the initial implementation to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
and investments accounted for under the cost method 
the guidance requires that investments which have declined in value due to credit concerns or solely due to changes in interest rates must be recorded as other than temporarily impaired unless the company can assert and demonstrate its intention to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment which might mean maturity 
this issue also requires disclosures assessing the ability and intent to hold investments in instances in which an investor determines that an investment with a fair value less than cost is not other than temporarily impaired 
on september   the financial accounting standards board decided to delay the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in issue this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
the disclosure guidance in issue was not delayed

due to those similarities and differences  diversity in practice exists with respect to accounting for non controlling investments in llcs 
the consensus reached was that an llc should be viewed as similar to a corporation or similar to a partnership for purposes of determining whether a non controlling investment should be accounted for using the cost method or the equity method of accounting 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value  the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  under the transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement caution about forward looking statements certain information contained in this discussion may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by phrases such as the company expects  the company believes or words of similar import 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks including  but not limited to  the following factors the ability to successfully manage the company s growth or implement its growth strategies if it is unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future  the ability to continue to attract low cost core deposits to fund asset growth maintaining cost controls and asset qualities as the company opens or acquires new branches  the successful management of interest rate risk  maintaining capital levels adequate to support the company s growth  changes in general economic and business conditions in the company s market area  changes in interest rates and interest rate policies  reliance on the company s management team  including its ability to attract and retain key personnel  risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  competition with other banks and financial institutions  and companies outside of the banking industry  including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  demand  development and acceptance of new products and services  problems with technology utilized by the company  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  and changes in banking and other laws and regulations applicable to the company 
although the company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward looking statements are based upon reliable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results  performance or achievements of the company will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  though it should be noted that the assets under management by tredegar are affected by equity price risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
given the current historic low in interest rates for the fiscal years of and  the model assumed only a basis point decrease in interest rates 
the following reflects the range of the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis during the fiscal years of and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp at the end of  the company s interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could increase by on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
since december   the bank s balance sheet has grown by million 
deposit inflows  increased borrowings from the federal home loan bank and the reduction in the securities portfolio have provided the funding for the growth in the loan portfolios 
overall  the bank continues to have minimal interest rate risks to either falling or rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  the bank could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  the bank could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
the company maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s specific goal is to lower where possible the cost of its borrowed funds 
the company enters into interest rate swaps to lock in the interest cash outflows on its floating rate debt 
on december   the company borrowed a  variable rate advance from fhlb 
on that same date  the company also entered into an interest rate swap with suntrust bank 
the total notional amount of the swap is  this cash flow hedge effectively changes the variable rate interest on the fhlb advance to a fixed rate of interest 
under the terms of the swap which expires december  the company pays suntrust bank a fixed interest rate of 
suntrust bank pays the company a variable rate of interest indexed to the three month libor  plus 
the interest receivable from suntrust reprices quarterly 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument of the variability of cash flows associated with the long term debt are reported in other comprehensive income 
this amount is subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on floating rate debt obligation affects earnings 
because there are no differences between the critical terms of the interest rate swap and the hedged debt obligation  the company has determined no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
