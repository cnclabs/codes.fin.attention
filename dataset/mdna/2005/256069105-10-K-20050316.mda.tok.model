item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that we believe are relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item also see item for related financial information 
overview we are one of the largest providers of rural and suburban wireless communications systems in the united states 
we began providing wireless telephone services in in oklahoma and the texas panhandle 
we have expanded our wireless operations with an acquisition strategy targeting underserved rural and suburban areas  which we believe have a significant number of potential customers with substantial needs for wireless communications 
on august   american cellular became our wholly owned indirect subsidiary  as discussed further in note  business combinations  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in addition  on october   we merged our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries  dobson sygnet communications company  sygnet wireless  inc  and sygnet communications  inc with and into our wholly owned subsidiary  dobson cellular 
as a result of these mergers  and the acquisition and restructuring of american cellular  our operations are encompassed in our two primary subsidiaries  dobson cellular and american cellular 
american cellular does not guarantee any debt or other obligations of dobson cellular or us  and dobson cellular and we do not guarantee any debt or other obligations of american cellular 
american cellular is required to file with the securities and exchange commission an annual report on form k for the year ended december  while we provide you with much of american cellular s financial and operational information  we refer you to american cellular s annual report for american cellular s financial and operational results 
critical accounting policies and practices we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with general accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we believe it is necessary for an understanding of our significant accounting policies to read the information below in conjunction with note  significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
these other significant accounting policies are important to develop an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  financial instruments and business combinations require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  it is necessary that we use estimates and assumptions for matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and reasonable assumptions 
our use of estimates and assumptions affects the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the amount and timing of revenues and expenses we recognize for and during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from estimates 
the estimates and assumptions that are the most difficult to determine and require the most subjective decisions  are described below 
property  plant and equipment and other definite life assets we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our customer lists and certain other identifiable intangible assets over their useful lives 
these useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
the factors used to determine these estimates include technological advances  obsolescence  expected migration to newer transmission standards and services  regulatory requirements and the churn rate of our customers 
also  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to review the carrying value of our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or 
table of contents changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgment must be exercised in determining when such an event or change in circumstances has occurred 
if such a circumstance were deemed to exist  the carrying value of the asset would be compared to the expected undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset 
we also must use judgment in determining expected future cash flows 
in particular  if customers decreased  our churn rate increased  customer or roaming revenue decreased  or costs to provide service increased  the likelihood of impairment increases 
as a result of technological advances  which led to our recent upgrade to gsm gprs edge technology during  we recently reassessed the useful lives and carrying values of our tdma network assets 
while no impairment was noted  this assessment did result in the reduction of our useful lives for these tdma network assets 
this reduction in the useful lives will result in an annual increase in depreciation expense totaling million through goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we continually assess the useful lives of our intangible assets 
a significant portion of our intangible assets are classified as wireless license acquisition costs  which represents our costs associated with acquiring our fcc licenses 
these licenses allow us to provide wireless services by giving us the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum 
although the fcc licenses are issued for only a fixed time  generally ten years  these licenses are renewed by the fcc on a routine basis and for a nominal fee 
in addition  we have determined that there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these fcc licenses 
as a result  our wireless license acquisition costs are treated as indefinite life intangible assets 
therefore  upon implementing sfas no 
in its entirety  we ceased the amortization of both goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs and now test for impairment of goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs at least annually and only adjust the carrying amount of these intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill or wireless license acquisition costs 
using judgment  we must also determine on an annual basis whether facts and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
to complete this evaluation for our wireless license acquisition costs  we compare the carrying amount of our wireless license acquisition costs to the fair value of those assets 
we determine the fair value of our wireless license acquisition costs based on their expected future discounted cash flows 
we also determine the value of the wireless license acquisition costs based upon a start up basis that separates the value of our customer contracts and other intangible assets from the pure underlying wireless license 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
for purposes of this comparison  it is our policy to aggregate all of our wireless license acquisition costs 
for goodwill  there is a two step approach for assessing impairment 
the first step requires us to compare the fair value of our enterprise to our carrying value  including goodwill 
if our carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of our enterprise goodwill with the carrying amount of our goodwill 
to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill we perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of all of our assets  with the implied goodwill amount being the difference between the enterprise fair value and the aggregate of the identified asset fair values 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the critical factors used in the determination of fair values of the enterprise and of the identifiable intangible assets include the discount rate  our cost of capital  cash flow multiples  expansion and infrastructure costs  other carriers multiples  expected customer growth rates  churn factors  service upgrade trends  and operating cost trends 
therefore  determining fair values and expected future discounted cash flows involves significant judgment on our part 
in particular  if customers decreased  our churn rate increased  customer or roaming revenue decreased  or costs to provide service increased  the likelihood of impairment would increase 
the fair value of an asset or an enterprise is the price at which the asset or enterprise could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated willing parties 
therefore  market prices from active markets are the best measure and are used when available 
if there is not an available active market  the 
table of contents measurement is based on the best information available  including similar transactions  acquisition cost per customer or area population  and expected discounted future cash flows 
acquisitions and discontinued operations we continually seek opportunities to acquire attractive wireless markets as part of our overall business strategy 
the following are the most recent transactions 
acquisition of michigan and rsas on december   we completed the acquisition of the michigan wireless assets of rfb cellular  inc  or rfb  and certain affiliates for million 
we purchased these assets in an auction conducted under sections and of the us bankruptcy code 
upon closing  we obtained control over most of these assets and began operation of them  however  assignment of certain spectrum licenses requires fcc approval  for which we have applied 
therefore  we have entered into a long term spectrum management lease that allows us to lease the rfb spectrum pending the fcc s decision 
we provide service in most of the northern part of michigan  including the upper peninsula 
the rfb acquisition allows us to expand our service area to cover the entire northern part of the state  and allows us to market our service under the cellularone brand throughout that market 
rfb operates both code division multiple access  or cdma  and analog technologies on mhz cellular licenses in these markets 
we intend to deploy gsm gprs edge technology over rfb s existing footprint 
acquisition of npi on june   we acquired certain assets of npi for approximately million 
these assets include pcs licenses and a gsm gprs edge network covering areas in northern michigan 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from npi beginning june  maryland michigan swap on february   we transferred our maryland rsa wireless property in exchange for cingular wireless michigan rsa wireless property  million in cash and its one percent ownership interests in texas rsa and oklahoma and rsas 
we are the majority owner of these three markets 
as a result of a definitive agreement that was entered into prior to december  and closed on february   we have reclassified our historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the operations of our maryland rsa property as discontinued operations 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from michigan rsa beginning february  california alaska swap on june   we transferred our two remaining wireless properties in california to at t wireless in exchange for its two wireless properties in alaska  and all of the outstanding shares of series aa preferred stock of dobson communications that it previously held  which we then cancelled 
we have reclassified our historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the operations of our california properties as discontinued operations 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from the two wireless properties in alaska beginning june  verizon sales on february   we sold three of our wireless properties to verizon wireless for a total purchase price of million 
these properties included california rsa  ohio rsa and georgia rsa 
on 
table of contents february   we sold our ownership interest in arizona rsa to verizon wireless for a total purchase price of million 
on february   american cellular sold tennessee rsa to verizon wireless for a total purchase price of million 
as a result of these sales  the results of operations  assets and liabilities of these markets during the periods presented are included as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
american cellular and we used the proceeds from the sale of these properties primarily to reduce bank debt under our respective credit facilities 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table summarizes our key operating data for the periods indicated year ended december  market population ending subscribers market penetration gross subscriber additions average subscribers average monthly service revenue per subscriber average monthly post paid churn represents the population in our licensed areas for the period indicated 
the results are based upon the population estimates provided by mapinfo corporation  a location software company  and the and results are based upon the claritas bureau of census results  adjusted to exclude those portions of our rsas and msas not covered by our licenses 
market penetration is calculated by dividing ending subscribers by market population 
average monthly service revenue per subscriber is calculated by dividing service revenue by average subscribers and dividing by the number of months in the period 
we exclude roaming revenue from this calculation  since roaming revenue is not derived from our subscribers 
average monthly post paid churn represents the percentage of the post paid subscribers that deactivate service each month 
the calculation divides the total post paid deactivations during the period by the average post paid subscribers for the period 

table of contents basis of presentation to provide a more comparable basis of our management s discussion and analysis  we have presented our historical results of operations from continuing operations for the periods indicated  along with our results from newly acquired markets 
for the purpose of this management s discussion and analysis  results from newly acquired markets refer to our results of operations of our recent acquisitions 
our recent acquisitions include the two alaska properties from june   american cellular from august   the michigan rsa property from february   the npi markets from june  and the rfb markets from december  the following table sets forth the components of our results of operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  year ended december  year ended percentage change results results results results december  in non acquisition from newly from non from newly from non markets acquired acquisition acquired acquisition historical markets markets historical markets markets historical vs

subscribers our subscriber base comprises three types of subscribers post paid  reseller and pre paid 
at december   post paid subscribers accounted for of our subscriber base 
these subscribers pay a monthly access fee for a wireless service plan that generally includes a fixed amount of minutes and certain service features 
in addition to the monthly access fee  these subscribers are typically billed in arrears for long 
table of contents distance charges  roaming charges and rate plan overages 
our reseller subscribers are similar to our post paid subscribers in that they pay monthly fees to utilize our network and services 
however  these subscribers are billed by a third party  which we refer to as a reseller  who has effectively resold our service to the end user  which we refer to as a subscriber 
we in turn bill the reseller for the monthly usage of the subscriber 
at december   the reseller base accounted for of our total subscriber base 
our pre paid subscribers  which at december  accounted for of our subscriber base  are subscribers that pre pay for an agreed upon amount of usage 
during  we experienced a decline in our gross subscriber additions as a result of increased competition attributable to an accelerating pace of improvements in quality of digital technology  and increased products offered to the consumer 
many of our competitors already market enhanced data services  such as single carrier radio transmission technology  or xrtt 
we recently deployed gsm gprs edge in our networks causing our decline in gross additions to level off 
we expect this to continue and could see our gross subscriber additions increase during as a result of these new services that are available with gsm gprs edge 
total gross subscriber additions included  from our newly acquired markets for the year ended december   and  from our newly acquired markets for year ended december  therefore  total gross subscriber additions from our non acquisition markets were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  operating revenue our operating revenue consists of service revenue  roaming revenue and equipment and other revenue 
service revenue we derive service revenue by providing wireless services to our subscribers 
the wireless industry has experienced declining average revenue per minute as competition among wireless service providers has led to reductions in rates for airtime 
prior to  these declines had generally been offset by significant increases in average minutes of use per subscriber 
beginning in and continuing through the first half of  the decline in revenue per minute had not been completely offset by increases in average minutes of use and our average monthly service revenue per subscriber decreased as a result 
however  during the last half of  we experienced growth in our average monthly service revenue per subscriber and we believe there is a continued opportunity in for our average monthly service revenue per subscriber to continue to increase from current levels primarily due to additional voice and data services available as a result of our gsm gprs edge technology 
for the year ended december   our historical service revenue increased compared to the years ended december  and this increase in our service revenue was primarily attributable to our newly acquired markets 
when comparing to  and to  the remaining increase in service revenue resulted from an increase in customers  offset by a decline in average monthly service revenue per subscriber 
our average subscriber base in our non acquisition markets was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  roaming revenue we derive roaming revenue by providing service to subscribers of other wireless providers when those subscribers roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
roaming revenue has traditionally had higher margins than revenue from our subscribers 
we achieve these higher margins because we incur relatively lower incremental costs related to billing  customer service and collections in servicing roaming customers as compared to our home subscribers 
however  our roaming margins have been declining due to increased market pressures and competition among wireless providers resulting in reduced roaming rates 
our roaming yield roaming revenue  which includes airtime  toll charges and surcharges  divided by roaming minutes of use was for the year ended december   for the year ended 
table of contents december  and for the year ended december  we expect our roaming yield to continue to decline  but at a lesser rate  during even though our significant roaming contracts have provided for decreasing rates over time  we believe these roaming contracts are beneficial because they secure existing traffic and provide opportunity for a continuing increase in traffic volumes 
roaming revenue tends to be impacted by seasonality 
historically  we have experienced higher roaming minutes of use and related roaming revenue during the second and third quarters of each year  as users tend to travel more and  therefore  use their wireless phones more  during the spring and summer months 
for the year ended december   our historical roaming revenue increased compared to the years ended december  and however  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our roaming revenue decreased 
when comparing to  this decrease was a result of a decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use in our non acquisition markets as contractual rates decreased during and  offset by a slight increase in roaming minutes in our non acquisition markets 
when comparing to  this decrease was a result of a decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use in our non acquisition markets as contractual rates decreased during  offset by a increase in roaming minutes in our non acquisition markets due to expanded coverage areas and increased usage 
equipment and other revenue equipment revenue is revenue from selling wireless equipment to our subscribers 
equipment revenue is recognized when the equipment is delivered to the customer 
other revenue is primarily rental income from the lease of space on company owned towers and  prior to  from amounts charged to our previously unconsolidated affiliates 
for the year ended december   our historical equipment and other revenue increased compared to the years ended december  and however  when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our equipment and other revenue decreased 
this decrease in revenue was primarily due to the elimination of amounts charged to our previously unconsolidated affiliates for the use of shared assets  offset by an increase the number of customers upgrading to new rate plans and purchasing new handsets and an increase in rental income 
many of these customers are upgrading to our new gsm gprs edge rate plans 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our equipment and other revenue increased 
this is due to increases in amounts previously charged to our unconsolidated affiliates for the use of shared assets 
operating expenses our primary operating expense categories include cost of service  cost of equipment  marketing and selling costs  general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization 
cost of service our cost of service consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our facilities utilized in providing service to customers and amounts paid to third party wireless providers for providing service to our subscribers when our subscribers roam into their markets  referred to as roaming costs 
consistent with the trend of declining roaming revenue per minute  our roaming expense per minute has declined as well as a result of a decrease in rates charged by third party providers 
while future rates charged by third party providers may continue to decrease  we expect the growth in our minute of use to grow at a faster rate  due to more usage and the continued build out of our wireless network 
therefore  we expect our roaming costs to continue to increase in future periods 
in addition  as a result of the sell and lease back of certain of our towers announced in march  we expect our total cost of service to increase in future periods 

table of contents the following table sets forth the historical results of the components of our cost of service for the periods indicated year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage in thousands network costs roaming costs total cost of service for the year ended december   our historical network costs  which are the costs we incur in operating our wireless network and providing service to our customers  increased  compared to the years ended december  and this increase in our network costs was primarily attributable to our newly acquired markets 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our network costs increased million 
this increase is a result of adding new circuits and cell sites related to our new gsm gprs edge network  as well as adding new costs for providing a higher level of phone features  such as handset insurance and ring tones 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our network costs declined million 
this is primarily a result of credits received from certain of our network service providers and renegotiated lower local access rates charged to us by third party providers for use of local access across the network 
for the year ended december   our historical roaming costs increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our roaming costs declined million 
this decline is primarily a result of a decrease in roaming costs per minute of use in our non acquisition markets as contractual rates decreased during  offset by an increase in the minutes used by our customers on third party wireless providers networks 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  roaming costs declined million 
this was primarily a result of a decline of in rates charged by those providers resulting from new lower rate agreements  offset by an increase of in the minutes used by our customers on third party wireless providers networks  in our non acquisition markets 
cost of equipment our cost of equipment represents the costs associated with wireless equipment and accessories sold to customers 
cost of equipment is impacted by the volume of equipment transactions 
the volume of equipment transactions is impacted by gross subscriber additions and customer upgrades 
we  like other wireless providers  have continued to use discounts on phone equipment and have continued to offer free phone promotions 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales 
while we expect to continue these discounts and promotions  we believe that these promotions will result in increased service revenue from an increase in the number of wireless subscribers and from higher priced rate plans 
with the continued migration of our customer base to gsm gprs edge rate plans and the continued increases in the cost of handsets  we would expect our cost of equipment to continue to increase during for the year ended december   our historical cost of equipment increased compared to the years ended december  and this increase in our cost of equipment was primarily attributable to our newly acquired markets 
when comparing to  the remaining increase in cost of equipment is due to an increase in the average cost of handsets sold to customers and an increase in the number of customers upgrading to new rate plans and purchasing new handsets 
many of these customers are upgrading to our new gsm gprs edge rate plans 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our cost of equipment decreased 
this is primarily a result of a decrease in gross subscriber additions in our non acquisition markets 

table of contents marketing and selling costs our marketing and selling costs include advertising  compensation paid to sales personnel and independent agents and all other costs to market and sell wireless products and services 
we pay commissions to sales personnel and independent dealers for new business generated 
for the year ended december   our historical marketing and selling costs increased compared to the years ended december  and this increase in our marketing and selling costs was primarily attributable to our newly acquired markets 
when comparing to  the remaining increase was due to increased spending on advertising to launch our new gsm gprs edge rate plans 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our marketing and selling costs decreased 
this was primarily a result of the decrease in gross subscriber additions in our non acquisition markets 
general and administrative costs our general and administrative costs include all infrastructure costs  including costs for customer support  billing  collections and corporate administration 
for the year ended december   our historical general and administrative costs increased compared to the years ended december  and this increase in our general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to our newly acquired markets 
when comparing to  the remaining increase was due to increased infrastructure costs as a result of the overall growth of our business  along with higher legal and consulting fees 
when comparing to  the remaining increase was due to increased infrastructure costs as a result of the overall growth of our business  offset by the reductions in bad debt expense as a result of improved collections and efficiencies gained from further integration of acquired companies and increased economies of scale in our non acquisition markets 
overall  our average monthly general and administrative costs per average subscriber has remained fairly constant in our non acquisition markets for the years ended december   and  although general and administrative costs have increased  our subscriber base has increased as well 
depreciation and amortization expense our depreciation and amortization expense represents the costs associated with the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets 
however  we do not amortize our wireless license acquisition costs or goodwill 
rather  these assets are subject to periodic evaluations for impairment 
during  we expect increases in depreciation and amortization as a result of newly acquired or constructed assets will mostly be offset as older assets become fully depreciated 
for the year ended december   our historical depreciation and amortization expense increased compared to the years ended december  and this increase was primarily a result of our newly acquired markets 
this remaining increase in depreciation and amortization expense in our non acquisition markets is a result of additional depreciation on fixed assets acquired or constructed  primarily from our gsm gprs edge network buildout in and non operating results interest expense for the year ended december   our interest expense increased compared to the years ended december  and the increase during is primarily due to increased notes payable related to our acquisition of american cellular 
when comparing to  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our interest expense decreased million 
this decline is primarily the result of the repayments of our outstanding balances on our dobson operating co  llc or doc  and sygnet wireless credit facilities and decreased variable interest rates as a result of lower interest rates and the expiration of our interest rate hedges  offset by the interest expense on dobson cellular s senior secured credit facility 

table of contents redemption and repurchases of  and dividends on  preferred stock as a result of implementing sfas no 
on july   dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock began being presented as a financing expense  included in our net loss  while dividends on our conditionally redeemable preferred stock remained below our net loss 
as a result of a mid year implementation  for the year ended december   dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are presented as both a financing expense  included in our net loss  and as an item below our net loss 
thus  our statement of operations includes the following year ended december  in thousands financing expense above net loss gain loss from redemption and repurchases of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock items applicable to common stockholders below net loss dividends on preferred stock gain from redemption and repurchases of preferred stock we issued  shares of series f preferred stock on august   which is a conditionally redeemable preferred stock 
the dividends on these shares were million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   and are included as dividends on preferred stock below our net loss 
in addition  on february   we issued  shares of series aa preferred stock which was conditionally redeemable preferred stock 
upon transfer of the series aa preferred stock by at t wireless on june   these shares were canceled 
the dividends on the series aa preferred stock were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and are included as dividends on preferred stock below our net loss 
the dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock totaled million for the year ended december   which compares to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this decrease in mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends from to is the result of the reduction in the number of shares of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock outstanding due to redemption and repurchases of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock during  and during the year ended december   we repurchased a total of  shares of our preferred stock and  shares of our preferred stock for an aggregate price of million 
these repurchases resulted in a gain from redemption and repurchases of preferred stock totaling million 
the gain from redemption and repurchases of preferred stock has been included in our loss from continuing operations 
during the year ended december   prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we repurchased a total of  shares of our preferred stock and  shares of our preferred stock  for an aggregate price of million 
this resulted in a gain from repurchase of preferred stock totaling million 
in addition  at t wireless transferred to us all of our series aa preferred stock  which had a fair value that was substantially lower than our carrying value  thus resulting in a gain on redemption of preferred stock of million 
therefore  our total gain from redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock prior to adoption of sfas no 
on july  was million 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 in  we repurchased a total of  shares of our preferred stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million  which  including fees and the related write off of deferred financing costs  resulted in a loss from redemptions and repurchases of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of million 
although our redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock are in two separate lines items for the year ended december   they netted to a gain of million on a combined basis 
during  we repurchased  shares of our preferred stock and  shares of our preferred stock  including accrued dividends on the repurchased shares  for an aggregate price of million 

table of contents including deferred financing costs  this resulted in a gain on redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock totaling million for the year ended december  other income expense  net for the year ended december   our historical other income expense decreased slightly compared to the year ended december  before giving effect to the newly acquired markets  our other income increased million  primarily due to a loss on sale of assets for the year ended december   offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our other income expense increased compared to the year ended december   due to an increase in interest income during and the write off of costs associated with the eleven licenses we did not receive in an fcc auction  which were written off during gain loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   our gain from extinguishment of debt was million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   and a gain of million for the year ended december  the gain from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was due to our repurchase of million principal amount of our senior notes at an aggregate cost of approximately million  excluding accrued interest 
we reported a gain on extinguishment of debt  net of deferred financing costs  of approximately million as a result of these purchases 
in addition  we purchased approximately million principal amount of our senior notes at an aggregate cost of approximately million  excluding accrued interest 
we reported a gain on extinguishment of debt  net of deferred financing costs  of approximately million as a result of these purchases 
these gains were offset by a loss on redemption of the remaining dobson sygnet senior notes  and a loss related to the amendment of the dobson cellular credit facility 
we redeemed the remaining million of dobson sygnet senior notes and recognized a loss from extinguishment of debt of million due to the premium paid and the write off of related deferred financing costs 
we paid off the and amended the dobson cellular credit facility  and we recognized a loss of million due to the write off of deferred financing cost related to the dobson cellular credit facility 
the loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was due to paying off the doc credit facility  the sygnet credit facility and million principal amount of the dobson sygnet senior notes 
our gain from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   resulted from the repurchase of million principal amount of dobson sygnet senior notes for the purchase price of million 
discontinued operations for the year ended december   we had income from discontinued operations of million compared to income from discontinued operations including the gain on the sale of million for the year ended december  and income from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  our discontinued operations during relate to the maryland properties included in the swap with cingular wireless  while our discontinued operations during relate to both the california properties included in the swap with at t wireless and the maryland properties included in the swap with cingular wireless 
discontinued operations during relate to the california properties included in the swap with at t wireless  the maryland properties included in the swap with cingular wireless and the markets sold to verizon wireless 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december   we recognized a total impairment on our wireless license acquisition costs of million  net of tax benefit  as a result of implementing sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
of this total  million reflects our impairment and million reflects our share of the impairment from our then interest in american cellular 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have required  and will likely continue to require  substantial capital to further develop  expand and upgrade our wireless systems and those we may acquire 
we have financed our operations through cash flows from operating activities  and when necessary  bank debt and the sale of debt and equity securities 
although we cannot provide assurance  assuming successful implementation of our strategy  including the continuing development of our wireless systems and significant and sustained growth in our cash flows  we believe that availability under our dobson cellular revolving line of credit  our cash and marketable securities on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently expected capital expenditures  working capital and debt service obligations over the next year 
in addition  in march  we announced an agreement to sell towers to gtp for million and lease the towers back from gtp under a lease with an initial year term 
however  this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions 
in the event we do not complete the sale of these assets  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates as a result of  among other things  the demand for our services and the regulatory  technological and competitive developments that may arise 
we currently expect that we may have to refinance our notes at their final maturities  which begin in sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings  vendor financing and the issuance of equity or debt securities 
some or all of these financing options may not be available to us in the future  since these resources are dependent upon our financial performance and condition  along with certain other factors that are beyond our control  such as economic events  technological changes and business trends and developments 
thus  if at any time financing is not available on acceptable terms  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
working capital and net cash flow at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of  an unrestricted cash balance of million and marketable securities of million  which compares to working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of  an unrestricted cash balance of million and marketable securities of million at december  working capital has decreased due primarily to our repurchase of million of our senior notes during the first quarter of  our repurchase of million of our preferred stock during the second quarter and third quarter of  our acquisition of two new markets during  and the completion of our gsm gprs edge network buildout  offset by cash provided by operating activities 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease in our operating income  a million decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations  and decreases resulting from our changes in our current assets and liabilities

effect of new accounting standards at the september  meeting of the eitf  the sec staff announced topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill 
eitf d states that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
rather  intangible assets should be separately and directly valued and the resulting fair value recognized 
as noted in critical accounting policies  we have used the start up method to determine the fair value of our licenses 
as a result  our financial condition or results was not impacted by the implementation of eitf topic d in december  the fasb published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payments 
statement r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
as a larger public entity  we will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   which is the third quarter of statement r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
as allowed  we have historically accounted for stock options using the accounting principles of opinion the impact of adopting the provisions of statement r will be to increase our non cash compensation expense in future periods 
we have not determined the method that we will use to estimate the fair value of stock options as part of our adoption of statement r 
as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  using the black scholes method of determining fair value in the past would have increased our non cash compensation expense  net of tax  by approximately million in  million in and million in based solely on the number of options currently granted  we expect the incremental expense associated with the adoption of statement r to be less than million  net of tax 
the provisions of our credit facilities  outstanding notes  and preferred stock do not include non cash compensation expenses in the determination of financial covenants 
as a result  the effects of the adoption of statement r will not have a significant impact on our financial condition or capital resources 
forward looking statements the description of our plans and expectations set forth herein  including expected capital expenditures and acquisitions  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these plans and expectations involve a number of risks and 
table of contents uncertainties 
important factors that could cause actual capital expenditures  acquisition activity or our performance to differ materially from the plans and expectations include  without limitation  our ability to satisfy the financial covenants of our outstanding debt and preferred stock instruments and to raise additional capital  our ability to manage our business successfully and to compete effectively in our wireless business against competitors with greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  changes in end user requirements and preferences  the development of other technologies and products that may gain more commercial acceptance than those of ours  terms in our roaming agreements  and adverse regulatory changes 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof including  without limitation  changes in our business strategy or expected capital expenditures  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates  including interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during november  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale by dobson cellular of million of senior secured notes to repay all outstanding borrowings under dobson cellulars credit agreement 
of the senior secured notes sold by dobson cellular  million bear interest at a variable rate  reset quarterly  of libor plus 
these notes are the only variable rate debt we had outstanding upon completion of the offering and repayment of the borrowings under the dobson cellular credit agreement 
as a result  after giving effect to this refinancing  a one percentage point change in interest rates would have changed our cash interest payments on an annual basis by approximately million
