item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with a review of our december  consolidated financial statements  item selected financial data and item business included elsewhere in this report 
certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
all discussions below relate to our continuing operations and accordingly exclude the discontinued operations sold in overview general we are a diversified holding company 
our wholly owned subsidiary  thermaclime  through its subsidiaries  owns substantially all of our core businesses consisting of the climate control and chemical businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing and selling of a broad range of water source heat pumps including geothermal heat pumps and hydronic fan coils  as well as other products including large custom air handlers  used in commercial and residential air conditioning systems and the manufacturing and selling of chemical products for the agricultural  varied industrial and mining markets 
climate control business the climate control business has significant market share in its niche of the united states commercial and residential heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac business 
most of their products have proprietary aspects and are produced to customer orders that are placed well in advance of required delivery dates 
as a result  the climate control business carries significant backlogs that eliminate the necessity to carry substantial inventories other than for firm customer orders 
during and  the climate control business profitability was affected by operating losses of certain new product lines being developed over the past few years 
in  the emphasis will be to move these new operations into an operating profit by increasing the sales levels above the breakeven point 
the climate control business profitability was also impacted by the reduced demand for its hydronic fan coil product line which relies on the hospitality and lodging industry as a significant market 
the demand in the hydronic fan coil market was impacted by a slowdown in major construction projects and deferral of major renovations attributed to events of september  in  our higher order levels for hydronic fan coils approximately greater than were consistent with a turnaround in the construction industry  which industry predicted that new hotel construction starts and renovation would increase during the climate control business has historically generated consistent annual profits and positive cash flows 
the climate control business objectives include the continued emphasis on increasing the sales and operating margins of existing products and on new product development 
the water source heat pump product line experienced a growth in sales in  as compared to and growth in  as compared to chemical business the chemical business is primarily a nitrogen business 
the primary raw material feedstocks anhydrous ammonia and natural gas are commodities  subject to significant price fluctuations and are purchased at prices in effect at time of purchase 
due to the uncertainty of the spot sales price  management has pursued a strategy of developing customers that purchase substantial quantities of products pursuant to sales agreements and or formulas that provide for the pass through of raw material costs  variable costs  and certain fixed costs  plus in most cases  a profit margin 
this pricing arrangement provides a hedge against the commodity risk inherent in the raw material feedstocks of natural gas and ammonia 
in addition management hedges most sales commitments made at fixed sales prices 
the remaining sales are primarily into agricultural markets at the price in effect at time of shipment 
the cost of the anhydrous ammonia and gas feedstock costs are decoupled from the sales price of the company s agricultural products resulting in profitability problems in this market in recent periods 
the problem with profitability in the agricultural market has been an imbalance of supply and demand 
for a number of years  the production capacity for prilled ammonium nitrate has exceeded the demand  resulting in low selling prices compared to the cost of production 
as a result of certain plant closures in our geographical markets  an overall reduction in the world grain stocks to use ratio and current industry forecasts for an increasing demand for grain production in  current selling prices are relatively strong 
in summary  the balance of supply vs 
demand appears to be improving 
liquidity and capital resources we are a diversified holding company 
our wholly owned subsidiary thermaclime  through its subsidiaries  owns substantially all of our core businesses consisting of the climate control and chemical businesses 
our cash requirements are primarily dependent upon credit agreements and our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries 
historically  thermaclime s primary cash needs have been for working capital and capital expenditures 
thermaclime and its subsidiaries depend on credit agreements  internally generated cash flows  and secured equipment financing in order to fund operations and pay obligations 
thermaclime is restricted by its credit agreements as to the funds that it may transfer to the non thermaclime companies and certain thermaclime companies 
thermaclime and its subsidiaries depend upon the five year senior secured loan that was completed in september and upon the four year working capital revolver loan  in addition to internally generated cash flows  to fund operations and pay their obligations 
the senior secured loan and the working capital revolver loan both have financial covenants that are described along with other details of the loans in loan agreements terms and conditions 
thermaclime s ability to maintain an adequate amount of borrowing availability under its working capital revolver loan depends on its ability to comply with the terms and conditions of such agreements and its ability to generate cash flow from operations 
as discussed in dividends under item  thermaclime is restricted under its credit agreements as to the funds it may transfer to lsb and its affiliates 
this limitation does not prohibit payment of amounts due under a services agreement  management agreement and a tax sharing agreement 
as of december   thermaclime had availability under its working capital revolver of million plus cash on hand of 
million 
management expects to utilize the net borrowing availability provided by the working capital revolver loan at a relatively high level during the spring agricultural season of after that period  the net borrowing is forecasted to decrease throughout the remainder of to normal borrowing levels 
this forecast is based upon information currently available 
the current outlook is subject to changes in economic conditions as well as market pricing of our products and costs of the various raw materials consumed 
the chemical business in recent years has been unable to generate significant positive cash flows due to lower than optimum sales volume levels  margin problems and extensive capital expenditure requirements to maintain plants and to comply with changing environmental regulations 
the ability to generate a positive margin on chemical sales is affected by the volatility of the raw material feedstocks of natural gas and anhydrous ammonia  as well as the necessity to produce at the optimum production levels to fully absorb the fixed plant costs 
the predominant costs of a process chemical plant are fixed costs 
the majority  approximately  of the chemical business sales are made pursuant to sales agreements that provide for the pass through of raw material costs  variable costs  and certain fixed costs  plus in most cases  a profit margin 
even though of our sales are based upon the above described sales agreements  our chemical business has sustained losses due  in part  to the sales volume not being sufficient to run the plants at optimum production levels 
management s plan for the chemical business is to continue their efforts to improve the cash flow by increasing the sales volume of the alabama and arkansas plants to more fully absorb the fixed costs of each plant  obtaining new customers that will accept the commodity risk of the raw materials  natural gas and anhydrous ammonia and will agree to long term commitments  and managing capital expenditures to those projects necessary to execute our business plans and those required to maintain environmental and safety compliance 
the and fourth quarter results were  adversely affected as a result of a mechanical failure in one of the four nitric acid plants at the el dorado  arkansas plant 
the failure  which resulted in major damage to a gas expander  caused the plant that normally produces  tons per month of nitric acid to go down on october  management estimates that the plant will not be back to normal production until the end of april we estimate that approximately million will be required to repair and rebuild the plant to allow it to resume normal production 
our property insurance is subject to a million deductible 
our business interruption insurance is subject to a forty five day waiting period before covering losses resulting from this incident 
we are unable  at this point  to estimate the exact cash flow and earnings impact resulting from the incident 
however preliminary indications  considering our deductibles  are that the negative impact on earnings resulting from the lost production was approximately million from october  through december  at december   we are unable to determine the proceeds to be received from our business interruption insurance  therefore  we have not made an adjustment to record any business interruption insurance recovery 
the receivable for business interruption recovery from the insurance company will be recorded in when the amount is agreed to 
capital expenditures our chemical business has historically required significant investment to fund capital expenditures  while our climate control business has been much less capital intensive 
we believe we have approximately million of committed capital expenditures for related to our chemical business  not including million for the repairs required by the mechanical failure of one of the four nitric acid plants as discussed above 
the million includes million relating to operations  and 
million for environmental compliance 
other capital expenditures are believed to be discretionary and are dependent upon an adequate amount of liquidity and or obtaining acceptable funding 
we have carefully managed those expenditures to projects necessary to execute our business plans and those for environmental and safety compliance 
as fully discussed in environmental matters under item  we currently expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately to million over the next three years to construct a new water treatment collection and discharge facility 
in addition our pro rata portion of engineering and construction costs for the city to build a pipeline for the discharged water is approximately million 
certain additional expenditures will be required to bring the sulfuric acid plant s air emissions to lower limits 
the ultimate cost is believed to be between million and million  to be expended over a six year period  which began with minimal expenditures in dividends due to previous operating losses and limited borrowing ability under credit facilities  we discontinued payment of cash dividends on common stock for periods subsequent to january  although dividends on all of our outstanding series of preferred stock are payable if and when declared by the board of directors  the terms of each outstanding series of preferred stock provide that dividends are cumulative  except for the redeemable  non cumulative  convertible preferred stock 
as of december  there is approximately million of accrued and unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred stocks 
we do not anticipate having funds available to pay dividends on our stock for the foreseeable future 
summary cash flow and liquidity will continue to be managed very carefully with close oversight by corporate executives 
management believes  based upon current forecasts  that we will have adequate cash in from internal cash flows and financing sources to enable us to satisfy our cash requirements as they are due in however  due to the volatility of the cost for major raw materials used in our chemical business  we have historically experienced revisions to financial forecasts on a frequent basis during the course of a year 
as a result  actual results may be significantly different than our forecast  which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and future operating results 
one of our non thermaclime subsidiaries continues to actively market its investment in a chemical plant located in pryor  oklahoma 
we do not currently have a contract for the sale of this plant 
loan agreements terms and conditions working capital revolver loan thermaclime finances it working capital requirements through borrowings under a working capital revolver loan 
under the working capital revolver loan  thermaclime and its subsidiaries may borrow on a revolving basis up to million based on specific percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
effective february  the working capital revolver loan was amended which  among other things  extended the maturity date to april and removed a subjective acceleration clause 
as of december  borrowings outstanding were million and the net credit available for additional borrowings was million 
the working capital revolver loan requires that thermaclime and its climate control business meet certain financial covenants 
the required ebitda amounts are measured quarterly on a trailing twelve months basis beginning march  the trailing twelve months ebitda requirements for range from million to million for thermaclime and is fixed at million for the climate control business 
the ebitda requirements were set at amounts based upon our forecasts which are presently considered by management to be achievable 
we have the ability to set our financial covenants under the working capital revolver loan agreement with our lenders on an annual basis each january 
in setting these covenants  we provide the lenders with a forecast that we believe to be a very conservative estimate of our operating results for the coming year 
for  we have established mutually agreeable limits that we believe are well within our ability to achieve 
senior secured loan in september  thermaclime and certain of its subsidiaries the borrowers completed a million term loan senior secured loan with a certain lender the lender 
the senior secured loan is to be repaid as follows quarterly interest payments which began september   quarterly principal payments of  beginning september   a balloon payment of the remaining outstanding principal of million and accrued interest on september  the senior secured loan accrues interest at the applicable libor rate  as defined  plus an applicable libor margin  as defined or  at the election of the borrowers  the alternative base rate  as defined  plus an applicable base rate margin  as defined  with the annual interest rate not to exceed or depending on the leverage ratio 
at december  the effective interest rate was 
the borrowers are subject to numerous affirmative and negative covenants under the senior secured loan agreement including  but not limited to  limitation on the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers  acquisitions  dissolution and sale of assets  and limitations on declaration of dividends and distributions to us  all with certain exceptions 
the borrowers are also subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  measured quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis 
the borrowers fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded the required ratio for the twelve month period ended december  the maturity date of the senior secured loan can be accelerated by the lender upon the occurrence of a continuing event of default  as defined 
the senior secured loan agreement includes a prepayment fee equal to of the principal amount should the borrowers elect to prepay any principal amount prior to september  this fee is reduced to during the second twelve month period and to during the third twelve month period and thereafter 
the senior secured loan is secured by a a first lien on i certain real property and equipment located at the el dorado facility  ii certain real property and equipment located at the cherokee facility  iii certain equipment of the climate control business  and iv the equity stock of certain of thermaclime s subsidiaries  and b a second lien on the assets upon which thermaclime s working capital revolver lender has a first lien 
the senior secured loan is guaranteed by the company and is also secured with the stock of thermaclime 
the proceeds of the senior secured loan were used as follows repaid the outstanding principal balance due under the financing agreement discussed below  including accrued interest  of million  repurchased a portion of thermaclime s senior unsecured notes due  held by the lender  including accrued interest  of million  paid certain fees and expenses of million including the cost of an interest cap which sets a maximum annual interest rate of or depending on the leverage ratio  repaid the outstanding principal balance of a term loan of 
million  paid down the working capital revolver loan with the remaining balance 
for  thermaclime will incur interest expense of approximately million relating to the senior secured loan 
cross default provisions the working capital revolver loan agreement and the senior secured loan contain cross default provisions 
if thermaclime fails to meet the financial covenants of the senior secured loan  the lender may declare an event of default  making the debt due on demand 
if this should occur  there are no assurances that we would have funds available to pay such amount or that alternative borrowing arrangements would be available 
accordingly  thermaclime could be required to curtail operations and or sell key assets as discussed above 
these actions could result in the recognition of losses that may be material 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent liabilities 
the more significant areas of financial reporting impacted by management s judgment  estimates and assumptions include the following receivables and credit risk our sales to contractors and independent sales representatives are generally subject to a mechanics lien in the climate control business 
our other sales are generally unsecured 
credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and other factors 
credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based on historical experience and periodic assessment of outstanding accounts receivable  particularly those accounts which are past due determined based upon how recently payments have been received 
our periodic assessment of accounts and credit loss provisions are based on our best estimate of amounts that are not recoverable 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer bases and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic areas  however  two customers account for approximately of our total receivables at december  we do not believe this concentration in these two customers represents a significant credit risk due to the financial stability of the two customers 
at december  and  our trade accounts receivable were net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
inventory valuations inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out basis 
at december  certain heat pump products were carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the last in  first out basis 
at december  and  the carrying value of certain nitrogen based inventories produced by our chemical business was reduced to the market price because the current cost exceeded the market price by million and 
million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets including goodwill we have considered impairment of our long lived assets and related goodwill including our chemical operations as a result of its unfavorable operating results over the last several years 
we obtained third party appraisals of the fair values associated with the el dorado and cherokee facilities and made estimates of fair values for others 
the timing of impairments cannot be predicted with any certainty and are primarily dependent on market conditions outside our control 
should sales prices drop dramatically without a similar decline in the raw material costs or should other matters  including the environmental requirements and or operating requirements set by federal and state agencies change substantially from our current expectations  a provision for impairment may be required based upon such event or events 
see item business environmental matters 
during and  based on these estimates and assumptions  we recognized impairments of  and  respectively  relating to corporate assets and  and  respectively  relating to the chemical business 
these impairments are included in other expense in the consolidated statements of income 
product warranty our climate control business sells equipment for which we provide warranties covering defects in materials and workmanship 
generally the warranty coverage for manufactured equipment is limited to months from the date of shipment or months from the date of start up  whichever is shorter  and to days for spare parts 
in some cases  an extended warranty may be purchased 
our accounting policy and methodology for warranty arrangements is to periodically measure and recognize the expense and liability for such warranty obligations using a percentage of net sales  based on historical warranty costs 
at december  and  our accrued warranty obligations were million and million  respectively and are included in accrued and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
accrued turnaround costs we accrue in advance the cost expected to be incurred in the next planned major maintenance activities turnarounds of our chemical business 
turnaround costs are accrued on a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit  which generally ranges from to months 
at december  and  accrued and other noncurrent liabilities include million and million  respectively  relating to turnarounds 
we are currently considering changing our accounting policy relating to turnarounds to a more preferable accounting method which is to expense these costs as incurred 
however  this change requires approval from certain lenders 
compliance with long term debt covenants as fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the senior secured loan and working capital revolver loan  as amended  of thermaclime and its subsidiaries require that thermaclime meet certain lender defined earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  capital expenditure limitation amounts and achieve minimum fixed charge coverage ratios quarterly  on a trailing twelve month basis 
thermaclime s forecasts for indicate that thermaclime will be able to meet all required covenant tests for all quarters and the year ending in december environmental and regulatory compliance as fully discussed in item business environmental matters  the chemical business is subject to specific federal and state regulatory and environmental compliance laws and guidelines 
we have developed policies and procedures related to environmental and regulatory compliance 
we must continually monitor whether we have maintained compliance with such laws and regulations and the operating implications  if any  and amount of penalties  fines and assessments that may result from noncompliance 
at december  a reserve of  has been established relating to a new cao and  relating to the slurry consent order 
these reserves are based on current estimates that may be revised in the near term based on results of our investigation and remediation pursuant to the new cao and slurry consent order 
in addition  we will be required to make expenditures as it relates to the npdes permit and air cao 
asset retirement obligations if we should decide to no longer operate the el dorado facility and if such facility is retired  we may be required to continue to operate equipment relating to discharge water  the cost and timing of which is presently unknown 
thus  we currently have not accrued any amounts for asset retirement obligations 
income tax accruals deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we are able to realize deferred tax assets up to an amount equal to the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
the taxable temporary differences will turn around in the loss carry forward period as the differences reverse 
other differences will turn around as the assets are realized or liabilities are paid in the normal course of business 
at december  and  our deferred tax assets were net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are a party to various litigation and other contingencies  the ultimate outcome of which is not presently known 
should the ultimate outcome of these contingencies be adverse  such outcome could create an event of default under thermaclime s working capital revolver loan and the senior secured loan and could adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for substantially all of our operations at the time title to the goods transfers to the buyer and there remains no significant future performance obligations by us 
if revenue relates to construction contracts  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
management s judgment and estimates in these areas are based on information available from internal and external resources at that time 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and judgments  as additional information becomes known 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in greater detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued pronouncement fasb interpretation no 
prior to  we  through our subsidiaries  entered into loan agreements where we loaned funds to the parent company of multiclima  sa multiclima a french manufacturer of hvac equipment  whose product line is compatible with our climate control business 
under the loan agreements  one of our subsidiaries has the option option to exchange its rights under the loan agreements for of the borrower s outstanding common stock 
this subsidiary also obtained a security interest in the stock of multiclima to secure its loans 
at december  the outstanding notes receivable balance  net of reserve  was million which was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
based on our assessment of the parent company and multiclima in relation to fin  as revised  we were required to consolidate this entity effective march  as a result of consolidating the consolidated assets and liabilities of the parent company of multiclima  at march  we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of 
million primarily relating to the elimination of embedded profit included in the cost of inventory which was purchased from multiclima by certain of our subsidiaries 
for the three months ended june  the parent company of multiclima had consolidated net sales of million and a net loss of 
million after all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated which are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for based on our assessment of the parent company and multiclima s historical and forecasted liquidity and results of operations during  we concluded that the outstanding notes receivable were not collectable 
as a result  effective july  we forgave and canceled the loan agreements in exchange for extending the option s expiration date from june  to june  we recognized a provision for loss of million in as a result of the cancellation and our valuation of this option  we no longer have a variable interest in this entity and are no longer required to consolidate this entity 
results of operations our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of two of our former subsidiaries  slurry explosive corporation slurry and universal technology corporation utec  as discontinued operations in therefore  the operations of slurry and utec are excluded from the results of our chemical business 
the following table contains certain information about our continuing operations in different industry segments for each of the three years ended december in thousands net sales climate control chemical other gross profit climate control chemical other operating profit loss climate control chemical general corporate expense and other business operations  net interest expense gains on extinguishment of debt provision for loss on notes receivable provision for impairment on long lived assets income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting changes as discussed above under recently issued pronouncement  for the three months ended june  we were required to consolidate the parent company of a french manufacturer multiclima of hvac equipment 
therefore the operating results include net sales of million  gross profit of 
million and an operating loss of 
million relating to multiclima after all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated for in april  a portion of the el dorado facility experienced damage from high winds and a likely tornado  which affected the ammonium nitrate production facilities  certain acid plants  a large cooling tower and other equipment 
the repairs were completed in during the repair time  we were not able to produce industrial grade ammonium nitrate until the middle of may production of our other products  agricultural grade ammonium nitrate and industrial acids  continued without material interruption 
our property insurance covering the chemical plant entitled us to receive approximate replacement value for the damaged property less an aggregate million deductible 
we also had a thirty day waiting period before our business interruption insurance coverage became effective 
in october of  a final settlement of million  net of the million deductible  was reached for the property and business interruption insurance claims 
the net proceeds relating to our property insurance claim exceeded the cash expenditures for repairs and the depreciated value of the damaged assets 
as a result  a net gain relating to property damage of approximately million is classified as other income and a business interruption insurance recovery of approximately 
million is classified as a reduction of cost of sales and is included in the consolidated statement of income for gross profit by industry segment represents net sales less cost of sales 
during  a cost recovery was recognized of million of precious metals used in the manufacturing process at the el dorado facility for metals accumulated from several operating units over the last several years 
during and  we wrote down the carrying value of certain nitrogen based inventories by 
million and 
million  respectively 
in addition  we recognized a loss on firm sales commitments of 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
beginning in through  a sulfuric acid plant at the el dorado facility experienced several mechanical problems with a boiler that had been repaired by one of our vendors 
as a result  other equipment was also damaged at the plant 
during  net settlements of million were reached with the vendor s insurance carrier and our insurance carriers 
these settlements are classified as a reduction of cost of sales and are included in the consolidated statement of income for operating profit loss represents operating income loss plus other income and other expense earned incurred by each industry segment before general corporate expenses and other business operations  net including unallocated portions of other income and other expense 
in computing operating profit loss from operations  none of the following items have been added or deducted general corporate expense and other business operations including unallocated portions of other income and other expense  interest expense  gains on extinguishment of debt  provision for loss on notes receivable  provision for impairment on long lived assets  benefit from termination of firm purchase commitments  income taxes  loss from discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting changes 
during  we recognized a gain of million from the sales of certain assets purchased in during  we incurred professional fees and other costs aggregating 
million relating to a proposed unregistered offering of senior secured notes which was terminated in june year ended december  vs 
year ended december  net sales net sales for were million compared to million for or an increase of million 
this increase includes increased sales in our chemical business of million reflecting  in part  higher sales prices resulting from the increased cost of the raw material feedstocks anhydrous ammonia and natural gas 
sales prices increased overall by in while volume of tons sold increased 
our climate control sales increased million due largely to increased demand for our heat pump products  net sales of multiclima consolidated in the second quarter of see discussion above under recently issued pronouncement  and continued growth in sales of large custom air handlers and certain start up operations 
gross profit gross profit was million or as a percentage of net sales for compared to million or for the net increase in gross profit includes an increase of million in our climate control business primarily as the result of increased sales as discussed above offset in part due to increased raw material costs relating to our hydronic fan coil products which were not passed through to our customers in the form of price increases 
the net increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of million in our chemical business due primarily to the lost production at the el dorado facility as a result of the mechanical failure discussed above in liquidity and capital resources  our inability to fully pass on to our customers the effect of the increased costs of our primary raw material feedstocks anhydrous ammonia and natural gas and a recovery of precious metals of million during that did not reoccur in offset in part by insurance settlements of million in as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million for the increase is due primarily to operating expenses of multiclima in the second quarter of as discussed above under recently issued pronouncement  increased employee compensation and shipping costs in the climate control business  professional fees incurred relating to a proposed unregistered offering of senior secured notes which was terminated during the second quarter of and increased warranty and advertising costs in the climate control business 
other income other income for includes a gain of million from the sales of certain non operating assets by a non thermaclime subsidiary 
gains on extinguishment of debt as discussed below under loan agreements terms and conditions  in september  thermaclime and certain of its subsidiaries completed a million term loan 
a portion of the proceeds were used to payoff the loans and accrued interest of million under a financing agreement 
in may climachem  inc later thermaclime  entered into a financing agreement pursuant to which it borrowed million 
the proceeds were used to repurchase million face value aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes 
the transaction was accounted for as a debt restructuring 
as a result  the gain on the transaction was deferred and all of the interest payments associated with the financing agreement was accounted for as long term debt 
all subsequent interest payments on the financing agreement up to and including the early repayment of the loan in september were charged against the debt balance as accrued on the balance sheet 
due to the repayment of the financing agreement prior to the maturity date of june  we recognized the remaining unearned interest of million as a gain on extinguishment of debt 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase of million relates primarily to interest expense incurred on the million term loan that was completed in september as discussed above 
there was no interest expense recognition on the financing agreement indebtedness since that transaction was accounted for as a voluntary debt restructuring in as discussed above 
the increase was partially offset due to the repurchase of million of the senior unsecured notes as discussed in below under loan agreements terms and conditions 
provision for loss on notes receivable as discussed above under recently issued pronouncement  based on our assessment of the current and projected liquidity and results of operations of multiclima and its parent company  we concluded that the outstanding notes receivable were not recoverable 
as a result  effective july  we forgave and canceled the loan agreements in exchange for extending the option s expiration date from june  to june  we have recognized a provision for loss of million for cumulative effect of accounting change effective march  we included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet the consolidated assets and liabilities of the parent company of multiclima as required under fin see recently issued pronouncements 
as a result  we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of 
million primarily relating to the elimination of embedded profit included in the cost of inventory which was purchased from multiclima by certain of our subsidiaries 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  net sales net sales for were million compared to million for or an increase of million 
this increase is attributed to increased sales in our chemical business of million caused primarily by the increased cost of the raw material feedstock  as discussed elsewhere  which resulted in higher sales prices 
sales prices increased overall by in while volume of tons sold increased 
the increased cost of the raw material feedstock is substantially reflected in the higher cost of sales 
the increase in sales in the chemical business was partially offset by decreased sales of million in our climate control business due largely to the decrease in sales of our hydronic fan coil products as a result of a softening in demand primarily in the lodging sector market 
gross profit gross profit was million or as a percentage of net sales for  compared to million or for the increase in gross profit is due primarily to our chemical business caused  in part  to the improvement in our ability to pass on to our customers the effect of the increased costs of our primary raw material feedstocks natural gas and anhydrous ammonia as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  we follow the practice of expensing precious metals used as a catalyst in the chemical business manufacturing processes as they are used  because the amount and timing of recovery is not predictable 
periodically  we recover a portion of the amount previously expensed 
during  a recovery of million also contributed to an increase in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily the result of increased shipping and handling costs of the climate control business and costs relating to insurance 
other income other income was million for compared to million for other income for includes the recognition of million from a property insurance claim 
gains on extinguishment of debt as discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  in december  we sold the remaining assets that comprised all of the explosives manufacturing and distribution business 
approximately million of the sales proceeds were used as a prepayment on borrowings under a financing agreement entered into in may due to this prepayment  thermaclime recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of million representing accrued interest through maturity on the prepaid principal 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease of million primarily resulted from the elimination of interest expense recognition on the financing agreement indebtedness  since that transaction for the repurchase of senior unsecured notes was accounted for as a voluntary debt restructuring during the second quarter of and at that time all future interest payments associated with the financing agreement indebtedness were recognized in long term debt 
income loss from discontinued operations as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in december  the remaining assets that comprised all of the explosives manufacturing and distribution business of slurry and utec were sold which operations are reflected as discontinued operations 
these operations were formerly included in the chemical business 
the loss from discontinued operations of million for is net of a gain on disposal of million 
cumulative effect of accounting change upon adoption of statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  we recognized 
million of negative goodwill as a cumulative effect of accounting change for cash flow from operations historically  our primary cash needs have been for operating expenses  working capital and capital expenditures 
we have financed our cash requirements primarily through internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  secured asset financing and the sale of assets 
see additional discussion concerning cash flows from our climate control and chemical businesses in liquidity and capital resources 
cash provided by operations from net income plus depreciation and amortization less other non cash adjustments was million 
cash used by operations included million for increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid supplies and a net decrease of million in accrued liabilities 
the decrease in accrued liabilities included million reduction in deferred rent expense  million decrease in customer deposits and million reduction in other accruals offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million

forward sales commitments risk periodically our chemical business enters into forward firm sales commitments of chemical products for deliveries in future periods 
as a result  we could be exposed to embedded losses should our product costs exceed the firm sales prices 
to minimize this risk  our chemical business enters into exchange traded futures for natural gas as discussed below
