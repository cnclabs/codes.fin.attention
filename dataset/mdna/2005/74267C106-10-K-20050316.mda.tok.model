item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  we  us and our refers to proassurance corporation and its subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially affected by the need to make accounting adjustments reflecting changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it involves significant judgment by management and if the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses our reserve for losses represents our estimate of the future amounts necessary to pay claims and expenses associated with the investigation and settlement of claims 
these estimates consist of case reserves and bulk reserves 
the estimates take into consideration our past loss experience  available industry data and projections as to future claims frequency  severity  inflationary trends and settlement patterns 
independent actuaries review our reserves for losses each year and prepare reports that include recommendations as to the level of reserves 
we consider these recommendations as well as other factors  such as known  anticipated or estimated changes in frequency and severity of claims and loss retention levels and premium rates  in establishing the amount of our reserves for losses 
estimating casualty insurance reserves  and particularly professional liability reserves  is a complex process 
these claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more  and estimating loss costs for these claims requires multiple judgments involving many uncertainties 
our reserve estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the assumptions used in establishing our reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
see the discussion under overview in this section for a history of our loss reserve development 
reinsurance our receivable from reinsurers represents our estimate of the amount of our future loss payments that will be recoverable from our reinsurers 
these estimates are based upon our estimates of the ultimate losses that we expect to incur and the portion of those losses that we expect to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
we also estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements wherein the premium due to the reinsurer  subject to certain maximums and minimums  is a percentage of the losses reimbursed under the agreement 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  these estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
our estimates of the amounts receivable from and payable to reinsurers are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
our assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our receivable from reinsurers  even a small adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
at december   we considered all of our receivables from reinsurers to be collectible 
investments we consider our fixed maturity securities as available for sale and our equity securities as either available for sale or trading portfolio securities 
both available for sale and trading portfolio securities are carried at fair value 
positive and negative changes in the market value unrealized gains and losses of available for sale securities are included  net of the related tax effect  in accumulated comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  and are excluded from current period net income 
positive and negative changes in the market value of trading portfolio securities are included in current period net income as a component of net realized investment gains losses 
we evaluate the securities in our available for sale investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for declines in market value below cost for the purpose of determining whether these declines represent other than temporary declines 
some of the factors we consider in the evaluation of our investments are the extent to which the market value of the security is less than its cost basis  the length of time for which the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
a decline in the fair value of an available for sale security below cost that we judge to be other than temporary is realized as a loss in the current period income statement and reduces the cost basis of the security 
in subsequent periods  we base any measurement of gain or loss or decline in value upon the adjusted cost basis of the security 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries  vary directly with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition of new and renewal premiums 
such costs are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs based on our estimates of the profitability of the underlying business and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets we make an annual assessment by reporting unit as to whether the value of our goodwill assets is impaired 
we completed such assessments in and and concluded that the value of our goodwill assets of approximately million was not impaired 
we use both market based valuation models and a capital assets pricing model to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
these models require the use of numerous assumptions regarding market perceptions of value as related to our consolidated and reporting unit historical and projected operating results and those of other economically similar entities 
changes to these assumptions could significantly lower our estimates of fair value and result in a determination that goodwill has suffered impairment in value 
liquidity and capital resources and financial condition proassurance corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because the parent holding company has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service 
the ability of those insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limitation by state insurance regulations 
see our discussions under regulation of dividendsfrom our operating subsidiaries in part i  and in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividend limitations 
within our operating subsidiaries our primary need for liquid funds is to pay losses and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business 
our operating activities provided positive cash flow of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as in the prior year  the primary sources of our operating cash flows are net investment income and the excess of premiums collected over paid net losses and operating costs 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses  particularly so with regard to our professional liability premiums 
a general measure of this timing delay is the paid loss ratio  which is computed by dividing paid losses for the year by net earned premium 
our paid loss ratios for the years ended december  and are and  respectively 
this timing delay is more evident in periods of premium growth  regardless of whether that growth is the result of additional business or rate increases 
we believe that premium adequacy is critical to our long term liquidity 
we continually review rates and submit requests for rate increases to state insurance departments as we consider necessary to maintain rate adequacy 
we are unable to predict whether we will continue to receive approval for our rate filings 
we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  as compared to million at december  we transfer most of the cash generated from operations into our investment portfolio 
we primarily invest in fixed maturity securities and in our investment in fixed maturity securities grew by million or 
the growth is primarily due to the investment of funds generated from operations  but also includes net proceeds of million from the sale of trust preferred securities having a face value of million  and funds transferred to fixed maturities from short term investments  cash and cash equivalents 
offsetting these increases is a million decline in fixed maturity unrealized gains 
substantially all of our fixed maturities are either united states government agency obligations or investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa at december  our investment policies implement an asset allocation that uses length to maturity as one method of managing our long term rate of return 
the weighted average modified duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years 
changes in market interest rate levels generally affect our net income to the extent that reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing securities 
additionally  changes in market interest rates may also affect the fair value of our fixed maturity securities 
net unrealized gains related to our available for sale securities decreased by million at december  as compared to december  primarily because average bond yields increased and prices declined during at december   equity investments represented approximately of our total investments  and approximately of our capital 
our equity investments are diversified primarily among domestic growth and value holdings through common and preferred stock 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our net reserves for losses net of amounts receivable from reinsurers at december  are approximately billion  an increase of million over net reserves at december  substantially all of this increase is in our professional liability segment  a long tailed business 
because of this characteristic  it is not unusual for reserves to increase  especially during periods of business growth 
activity in the net reserve for losses during and is summarized below year ended december in thousands balance  beginning of year    less reinsurance recoverables    net balance  beginning of year    incurred related to current year    prior years    total incurred    paid related to current year    prior years    total paid    net balance  end of year    plus reinsurance recoverables    balance  end of year    as of december   our insurance subsidiaries had consolidated reserves for losses on a gaap basis that exceeded those on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of gaap reserves that are reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability  or retirement of an insured 
we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write large limits of liability  to reduce losses of a catastrophic nature and to stabilize underwriting results in those years in which such losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
the effective transfer of risk is dependent on the credit worthiness of the reinsurer 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
our reinsurance brokers assist us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
at december  our receivable from reinsurers approximated million 
the following table identifies our reinsurers from which our recoverables net of amounts due to the reinsurer are million or more as of december  a

although the mcca acts in the same manner as a reinsurer  it is not an insurance company and hence is not rated by am best 
we have not experienced any difficulties in collecting amounts due from reinsurers due to the financial condition of the reinsurer 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
as our premiums have grown  so has our need for capital to support our insurance operations and maintain our ratings 
in recent years  we have taken actions to obtain additional capital for general corporate purposes  including supporting growth by our insurance subsidiaries 
in late  we raised million through the sale of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
in july we received million from the issuance of twenty year convertible debentures due june the convertible debentures  and in april and may  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of trust preferred securities having a face value of million 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a more detailed description of the convertible debentures and the trust preferred subordinated debentures 
during the three year period ended december   we repaid bank debt of million and contributed million on a net basis to our insurance subsidiaries 
we have on file a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that would allow us to offer from time to time up to million in common stock  preferred stock or debt securities 
we may sell any class of the registered securities or combinations thereof in one or more separate offerings at a total price up to the amount registered with the amount  price and terms of the securities sold in each offering to be determined at the time of sale 
our ability to sell any of these securities will depend in part on our ability to continue profitable operations and maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by am best and standard poor s 
any sale would require us to file a supplemental prospectus that specifies the terms of the securities to be sold 
if securities are sold  we expect that the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include contributions to the capital and surplus of our subsidiaries  the repurchase of outstanding debt securities  or the repayment of other indebtedness 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees in april and may  we formed two business trusts the trusts with the sole purpose of the trusts being to issue  in private placement transactions  million of trust preferred stock tps  and use the proceeds thereof  together with the equity proceeds that we contributed upon formation of the trusts  to purchase our million variable rate subordinated debentures trust preferred subordinated debentures or subordinated debentures  which are the only assets of the trusts 
the terms and maturities of the subordinated debentures mirror those of the tps 
the trusts will meet the obligations of the tps with the interest and principal we pay to the trusts related to the subordinated debentures 
in accordance with the guidance given in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  variable interest entities fin r the trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of either of the trusts 
the subordinated debentures are payable to the trusts and are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as long term debt 
we have issued guarantees that amounts paid to the trusts related to the subordinated debentures will subsequently be remitted to the holders of the tps 
the amounts guaranteed are not expected to at any time exceed our obligations under the subordinated debentures  and we have not recorded any additional liability related to the tps or the guarantee 
contractual obligations a schedule of our non cancelable contractual obligations at december  follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations    total     our long term debt obligations above include the repayment of principal on our convertible debentures and our subordinated debentures 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for the rental of office space  office equipment  and communications lines and equipment 
overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are almost entirely derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries 
in  the professional liability segment contributed approximately of our total revenues and the personal lines segment contributed approximately of total revenues 
proassurance s professional liability segment primarily provides medical professional liability insurance to physicians and physician groups 
the personal lines segment primarily provides auto insurance to members of the michigan educational community and their families 
corporate strategy we emphasize disciplined underwriting and do not manage our business to achieve a certain level of premium growth or market share 
in our professional liability business  we apply our local knowledge to individual risk selection  and determine the appropriate price based on our assessment of the specific characteristics of each risk 
in our personal lines business  we target the educational community  which we believe provides a preferred  stable and predictable group of risks 
in addition to prudent risk selection  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management 
we investigate each professional liability claim and have fostered a strong culture of aggressively defending those claims that we believe have no merit 
we manage these claims at the local level  tailoring claims handling to the legal climate of each state  which we believe differentiates us from national writers 
in our personal lines business  we seek to quickly and efficiently resolve claims through an established network of auto repair shops and other repair facilities  focusing on minimizing the cost of handling each claim 
by concentrating on specialty markets where customers have specialized needs  we seek to provide value added solutions through our underwriting expertise and our emphasis on strong customer service 
through our regional underwriting and claims office structure  we are able to gain a strong understanding of local market conditions and efficiently adapt our underwriting and claims strategies to regional conditions 
our regional presence also allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers and be more responsive to their needs 
we believe these factors have allowed us to establish a leading position in our markets  enabling us to compete on a basis other than just price 
we also believe that our presence in local markets allows us to monitor and understand changes in the liability climate and thus develop better business strategies in a more timely manner than our competitors 
our goal is to build upon our position as a leading writer of professional liability and personal lines insurance and expand within a defined geographic area  while maintaining our commitment to disciplined underwriting and aggressive claims management 
according to am best  based on data we are the th largest active medical liability insurance writer in the nation  and we believe we are the largest medical liability writer in our collective states of operation 
we believe that our strong reputation in our regional markets  combined with our financial strength  strong customer service and proven ability to manage claims  should enable us to profitably expand our position in select states 
in our personal lines business  we estimate that we currently insure approximately of the educational community active and retired teaching professionals and service employees in michigan 
we expect to increase our penetration of the educational community by appointing additional agents and broadening our existing relationships with educational institutions and their employees 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and believe our financial size and strength make us an attractive acquirer 
the current professional liability climate may also provide us with the opportunity to undertake additional mergers or acquisitions of companies or books of business within or adjacent to  our states of operation 
we continually evaluate these opportunities to leverage our core underwriting and claims expertise 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the strong ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we intend to manage our business to protect our financial security 
growth opportunities and outlook we expect our future growth in professional liability will be supported by controlled expansion in states where we are already writing business and into additional states within  or adjacent to  our existing business footprint 
we also believe there may be additional opportunities for profitable expansion of our professional liability business as insurers continue experiencing financial difficulties  requiring them to reduce their business or completely exit the marketplace 
this may also lead to opportunities to expand through the acquisition of other companies or books of business 
we believe we are viewed as a market leader because of our financial strength and stability  and our ability to deliver excellent service at the local level 
our reputation allows us to take advantage of marketing conditions that are improving as price increases are implemented and earned 
our stability also makes us an attractive insurer in light of the highly publicized insolvencies in our industry  as well as the regulatory actions taken against several former competitors 
in and  our professional liability segment achieved average gross price increases of approximately and  respectively  on renewal business weighted by premium volume 
in we expect professional liability pricing to continue to increase  albeit at a much slower pace 
we believe our balance sheet strength will continue to be a differentiating factor in the market 
additionally  we plan to appoint new agents in underserved areas in the states where we write business and we believe that will bring us additional business as well 
in the personal lines segment  our strong capitalization provides operational flexibility allowing growth and expansion in michigan and adjacent states 
we believe we can take advantage of growth opportunities in both segments while continuing to maintain our combined ratio 
as with all property and casualty companies  we expect the beneficial impact of price increases to be fully reflected in our financial results over time as premiums written at the higher prices are earned which generally occurs over the course of the year after the policy is issued 
losses and reinsurance losses are the largest component of expense for both the professional liability segment and the personal lines segment 
as discussed in critical accounting policies  net losses in any period reflect our estimate of net losses related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for net losses of prior periods 
the estimation of medical professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
injuries may not be discovered until years after an incident  or the claimant may delay pursuing the recovery of damages 
ultimate loss costs  even for similar events  vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the nature of the injury and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimants family  the judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and the trend of health care costs 
medical liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
losses for the personal lines segment primarily result from property claims 
such claims are typically settled and paid without litigation within one year after the claim is reported 
the personal lines segment also incurs losses due to personal liability claims 
personal liability losses more closely resemble medical professional liability losses and are more complex to estimate 
injuries and their severity are subject to litigation and may take some years to determine 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write large limits of liability  to reduce losses of a catastrophic nature and to stabilize underwriting results in those years in which such losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we reinsure professional liability risks under treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  per claim retention levels have varied between the first  and the first million depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
periodically  we provide insurance to policyholders above the maximum limits of our primary reinsurance treaties 
in those situations  we reinsure the excess risk above the limits of our reinsurance treaties on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
we currently reinsure our personal lines risks in excess of  per loss 
individual property risks are covered up to million per risk and casualty risks are covered on an excess of loss basis up to million per occurrence 
as a member of the mcca  we receive coverage for auto personal liability losses in excess of  per loss 
the mcca charges an annual assessment  based on the number of vehicles for which coverage is written  to cover the losses reported by all member companies 
michigan law provides that the mcca assessments charged to member companies for this protection can be recognized in the rate making process and passed on to policyholders 
we treat any amounts due from the mcca as reinsurance and the assessments due to mcca as ceded premiums 
our personal lines segment is further covered by catastrophe reinsurance which provides additional protection from significant aggregate physical damage exposure arising from a single event such as windstorm  hail  tornado  earthquake  riot  blizzard  freezing temperatures or other extraordinary events 
our catastrophe coverage is up to million in excess of million subject to retention of 
we also cede of our umbrella policy liabilities under a quota share reinsurance arrangement 
our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience  our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state and our assessment of our financial capacity to assume greater risk 
our reinsurance treaties renewed with minimal change in terms or conditions from the prior year 
we have structured the program to include a broader participation of reinsurers to further diversify our credit risk 
the following table  known as the loss reserve development table  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserves to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserves  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following may be helpful in understanding the loss reserve development table the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects the company s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as showing in the company s consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year 
analysis of losses and loss reserve development in thousands december  reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables       cumulative net paid  as of one year later       two years later       three years later       four years later       five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  re estimated net liability as of end of year       one year later       two years later       three years later       four years later       five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  net cumulative redundancy deficiency      original gross liability end of year       less reinsurance recoverables       original net liability end of year       gross re estimated liability latest       re estimated reinsurance recoverables       net re estimated liability latest       gross cumulative redundancy deficiency       december  reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables      cumulative net paid  as of one year later     two years later    three years later   four years later  five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later re estimated net liability as of end of year     one year later     two years later    three years later   four years later  five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later net cumulative redundancy deficiency     original gross liability end of year     less reinsurance recoverables     original net liability end of year     gross re estimated liability latest     re estimated reinsurance recoverables     net re estimated liability latest     gross cumulative redundancy deficiency     in years and thereafter the table reflects the reserves of proassurance  formed in in order to merge medical assurance and professionals group  and includes both professional liability segment and personal lines segment reserves 
amounts shown in the table for years prior to relate only to the reserves of medical assurance 
in each year reflected in the table  we have utilized actuarial methodologies  including incurred loss development  paid loss development and frequency severity projections  to estimate reserves 
these techniques are applied to the data and the resulting projections are evaluated by management to establish the estimate of reserves 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development include the following our volume of business in the late s and early s  while substantial  was not of a sufficient size to fully support the actuarial projection process  thus  our data was supplemented with industry based data 
substantially all of our business was derived from medical professional liability insurance written in alabama until we began to geographically expand our business in the mid to late s 
we utilized a rigorous and disciplined approach to investigating  managing and defending claims 
this philosophy generally produced results in alabama that were better than industry averages in terms of loss payments and the proportion of claims closed without indemnity payment 
ultimately  actual results proved better than the industry data  creating redundancies 
our reserves established in the late s and early s were strongly influenced by the dramatically increased frequency and severity that we  and the industry as a whole  experienced during the mid s 
some of these trends moderated  and in some cases  reversed  by the late s or early s 
however  the ability to recognize the improved environment was delayed due to the extended time required for claims resolution 
when these negative trends moderated  the reserves we established during those periods proved to be redundant 
the professional liability legal environment deteriorated once again in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
as a result  favorable development of prior year loss reserves slowed in and reversed in and we have addressed these trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
beginning in the table includes reserves for personal liability losses which are also initially difficult to estimate 
we established reserves for these claims at levels that we consider reasonable but prudent  given rising medical costs and unpredictable litigation trends 
as the claims matured  our reserve estimates were adjusted to reflect actual loss costs experienced 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected financial data for each period is summarized in the table below 
year ended december increase decrease in thousands revenues gross premiums written    net premiums written    premiums earned    premiums ceded    net premiums earned    net investment income    net realized investment gains losses    other income    total revenues    expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses    reinsurance recoveries    net losses and loss adjustment expenses    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses    loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense    total expenses    income before income taxes and minority interest    income taxes benefit    income before minority interest    minority interest net income    net loss ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio less investment income ratio operating ratio return on equity net income divided by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
we measure performance in a number of ways  but particularly focus on the combined ratio and investment returns which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a return on equity of to 
our earnings are almost entirely derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries 
we manage our insurance operations at a segment level because of the differing operating characteristics of each segment 
we believe that a focus on a premium adequacy  selective underwriting and effective claims management is required if we are to achieve our roe targets and we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and acquisition  underwriting and insurance expenses at the segment level 
investment income and net realized investment gains and losses are managed and monitored both at the segment level and on a consolidated basis in order to meet the liquidity and profitability needs of each insurance company as well as to maximize after tax income investment returns at a corporate level 
our segments engage in activities that generate other income 
such activities  principally fee generating and agency services  do not constitute a significant source of revenues or profits on either a segment or a consolidated basis 
the increase in our roe is primarily attributable to our success in reducing our net loss ratio 
both segments showed improvement in their net loss ratio 
the improvement in the professional liability ratio had the most pronounced effect on roe because of consolidated net earned premiums are attributable to this segment 
our operating results also benefited from additional investment income earned as a result of the growth in our invested assets 
premiums gross premiums written year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands gross premiums written professional liability    personal lines    professional liability written premiums vary from period to period for a number of reasons 
some of the more common differences result from changes to premium rates  the volume of new business written during the period  the loss of business to competitors or due to our own underwriting decisions  and the percentage of our policies that renew  which may also affect the level of tail premiums written 
strategic factors  such as our decision to convert our remaining occurrence policies to claims made coverage  and market factors  such as the entry or exit of a competitor in a given market  may also affect written premiums from period to period 
the effect of any of these changes also varies by the proportion of policies written or renewed during each period in the various geographical regions and classes of business in which we operate 
professional liability premiums exhibited strong growth in  however  the growth was at a slower pace than in primarily because we implemented smaller rate increases in as compared to our rates are based on our expected losses for the coverages provided  the cumulative effect of the rate increases we have obtained in the past several years allowed us to pursue lower rate increases in some states in on average  renewals during the year ended december  have been at rates that are approximately higher than expiring rates 
rate increases on renewals  on average  were at rates that were higher than expiring rates 
new business written in was largely offset by business that did not renew  including business that we selectively chose not to renew 
we continue to aggressively pursue only that business that we believe we can write at a profitable rate 
virtually all of the growth that we experienced in was related to physician coverages 
this growth included an increase of approximately million related to physician tail policies 
tail policies are written to physicians that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us 
we prefer not to write tail coverage due to the occurrence like loss liability that it creates  but the decision to purchase this coverage is at the option of the departing policyholder 
premiums written for this coverage can vary significantly from year to year 
in the latter half of  we began the process of converting our professional liability occurrence coverages to claims made coverages and completed this process in first year claims made coverage has a significantly lower premium than occurrence coverage due to lower loss exposure  but steps through an increasing rate progression from first year to mature  over a multi year period which is generally five years 
this increasing rate progression is the result of our increasing exposure to loss 
during the period of rate progression  all else being equal  our premiums and our losses will increase 
personal lines premium revenues are almost entirely comprised of auto and homeowners premiums with auto premiums representing of written premiums and of written premiums 
during the year ended december  auto premiums increased by million while homeowner premiums grew by million 
the growth of auto premiums is primarily attributable to rate increases and to increases in the value of insured autos and a small increase in the number of autos insured 
the growth in homeowner premiums is due to increases in the number of insured homes  rate increases  and an increase in the value of the homes insured with no one factor predominating 
premiums earned year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands premiums earned professional liability    personal lines    premiums are earned pro rata over the entire policy period generally one year after the policy is written 
thus the increase in earned premiums reflects on a pro rata basis the changes in written premiums that occurred during both and premiums ceded year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands premiums ceded professional liability    personal lines    premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we must ultimately pay to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
in both and  we reduced our estimates of prior year gross losses in our professional liability segment 
as a result  we also reduced our estimates of ultimate ceded premiums 
the reduction was million in and million in professional liability premiums ceded were also reduced by million in due to the commutation of reinsurance treaties with gerling 
additionally  as premium rates have risen  our insureds have purchased policies with lower coverage limits 
we do not cede these premiums  and as a result  premiums ceded have declined 
personal lines premiums ceded primarily increased because of a significant rise in the per car assessment charged by the mcca  and also as a result of growth in the volume of premiums written 
losses and loss adjustment expenses calendar year losses may be divided into three components i actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year  ii actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  and iii actuarial re evaluation of the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision ddr in our claims made policies 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with our estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
calendar year results include the operating results for the current accident year and  as discussed in critical accounting policies  any changes in estimates related to prior accident years 
net losses the following table summarizes net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
the net loss ratios shown are calculated by dividing the applicable net losses by calendar year net premiums earned 
december  december  net loss ratio net loss net loss increase net losses ratio net losses ratio decrease in thousands except percentage amounts net losses calendar year professional liability   personal lines   net losses current accident year professional liability   personal lines   change in prior accident year losses favorable professional liability  personal lines   current accident year net losses in the professional liability segment increased by or million in as compared to during  we have continued to see an increase in loss severity  which has increased loss costs 
professional liability current accident year net loss ratios are lower in than in primarily because loss costs  while continuing to increase  have increased at a slower pace than premium rates 
loss ratios have also improved because we converted our occurrence policies to claims made coverage as discussed under premiums 
generally  loss ratios associated with claims made coverage are initially lower than those associated with occurrence coverage 
we decreased our estimate of professional liability prior year net losses by million in and  in the amount represents of professional liability net reserves 
these adjustments were in response to actuarial evaluations of loss reserves performed during the period 
no change was made to our estimates of the reserves required for death  disability and retirement during or personal lines losses have remained relatively stable  even though the number of insured risks has increased 
we experienced an overall reduction in the frequency of auto collision and comprehensive claims reported in  which more than offset increased water damage claims from severe thunderstorms in may the reduction in frequency is the primary reason that loss ratios improved in as a result of favorable development related to the frequency and severity of prior year auto liability reserves  we reduced personal lines prior year net losses during both and gross losses and reinsurance recoveries the effect of adjustments made to reinsured losses is mitigated by the corresponding adjustment that is made to insurance recoveries 
thus  in any given year  we may make significant adjustments to gross losses that have little effect on our net losses 
the following table reflects our losses by segment on both a gross and a net basis year ended december increase decrease in thousands gross losses professional liability    personal lines    reinsurance recoveries professional liability    personal lines    net losses professional liability    personal lines   when discussing losses that are reinsured and losses that are retained  it is common to refer to layers of loss 
the retained layer is the cumulative portion of each loss  on a per claim basis  which is less than our reinsurance retention for a given coverage year 
likewise  the reinsured layer is the cumulative portion of each loss that exceeds the reinsurance retention 
in  as was also the case in  our actuarial analysis of our professional liability reserves indicates that our claims severity has continued to increase as expected in our retained layers 
however  we have not experienced the high level of losses in our reinsured layers that we originally anticipated and for which we established reserves 
accordingly  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses by approximately million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  these losses were heavily reinsured  therefore  we reduced expected reinsurance recoveries by million in and million in as previously discussed  these changes to prior year estimates reduced net losses by million in and nominally reduced net losses in in both and  the decrease to reinsurance recoveries for prior accident years more than offset reinsurance recoveries for current accident years resulting in a non traditional relationship between gross losses and recoveries 
our personal lines segment gross losses and reinsurance recoveries also reflect large adjustments for heavily reinsured losses 
we increased our loss estimates for auto personal injury losses ceded to the mcca by approximately million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  in both years  these unfavorable adjustments were offset by favorable adjustments made to losses that were not heavily reinsured  primarily auto liability reserves 
as previously discussed  these reserve adjustments decreased net losses by million in and million in assumptions used in establishing our reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
net investment income and net realized investment gains losses net investment income is primarily derived from the interest income earned by our fixed maturity securities and includes interest income from short term and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts  and rental income earned by our commercial real estate holdings 
investment fees and expenses and real estate expenses are deducted from investment income 
increase increase decrease decrease in thousands except percentage amounts net investment income professional liability    personal lines   not attributed to segments   the increase in our net investment income in as compared to is due to higher average invested funds in  offset by a slight decline in the yield of our fixed maturity securities 
while prevailing market interest rates have remained historically low  changes in the duration and asset mix of the portfolio have helped to stabilize the yield of the portfolio 
we have increased the weighted average duration of the portfolio from years at december  to years at december  in order to take advantage of improved yields on certain longer term securities 
we have also increased the proportion of the portfolio that is invested in tax exempt securities because of the higher after tax yields available on these securities 
however  we have continued to see some decline in our income yields as older  higher yielding securities mature or are sold 
our average income yield  on a consolidated basis  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  our average tax equivalent income yield on a consolidated basis was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  investment income is a more substantial revenue source for the professional liability segment both because of significantly higher premium collections and because  on average  professional liability premiums are collected some years before the related losses are paid 
as a result  investment income is a less significant component of revenues for the personal lines segment than for the professional liability segment because the length of time between the collection of premiums and the settlement of claims is generally short 
thus premium growth  as compared to the professional liability segment  generally has a less significant effect on average invested funds 
personal lines investment income has increased due to higher average invested funds  however the improvement is less pronounced in this segment 
the components of net realized investment gains are shown in the following table 
year ended december in thousands net gains losses from sales   other than temporary impairment losses trading portfolio gains losses  net realized investment gains losses   underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses are comprised of variable costs  such as commissions and premium taxes that are directly related to premiums earned  and fixed costs that have an indirect relationship to premium volume  such as salaries  benefits  and facility costs assessments 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in in both segments primarily because of higher variable costs 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in both segments  primarily due to additional commission expense incurred as a result of premium growth 
in the professional liability segment  changes in the mix of premiums by state and coverage type also increased commission expense 
both segments also experienced increases in costs for salaries  benefits and professional fees  most significantly those fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
the expense ratio for the professional liability segment increased by because of higher commission costs  there was no notable change in the personal lines expense ratio 
expense ratio year ended december year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses professional liability    personal lines    guaranty fund assessments are amounts we are required to contribute to state insolvency or guaranty fund associations when so assessed by the state 
such assessments can and do vary significantly from period to period  but remained low throughout both and guaranty fund assessments were approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense increased in as compared to primarily because the average amount of debt outstanding was higher in but also because interest was paid at a higher rate in the first half of as compared to the first half of in the first half of our only debt was an outstanding bank term loan 
in july we issued million of convertible debentures at a fixed rate of and repaid a million bank term loan which carried a variable rate 
we increased our debt again in april and may of  when we issued subordinated debentures of million 
taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is from tax exempt interest and dividends 
the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected financial data for each period is summarized in the table below 
year ended december increase decrease in thousands revenues gross premiums written    net premiums written    premiums earned    premiums ceded    net premiums earned    net investment income    net realized investment gains losses    other income   total revenues    expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses    reinsurance recoveries    net losses and loss adjustment expenses    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses    loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense   total expenses    income before income taxes    income taxes benefit   income before minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change    minority interest   income before cumulative effect of accounting change    cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax   net income    net loss ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio less investment income ratio operating ratio return on equity net income divided by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
our roe improved in primarily because we reduced our net loss ratio by more than five points as compared to the net loss ratio of our professional liability segment  which produced of net earned premiums  was reduced from to  this improvement contributed significantly to the increase in our roe 
premiums gross premiums written year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands gross premiums written professional liability    personal lines    the increase in professional liability gross written premiums is principally due to rate increases 
on average  renewals during the year ended december  were at rates that were approximately higher than expiring rates 
we also experienced premium growth in from new business in states where competitors had left the professional liability market 
the growth in new business was largely offset by policies that did not renew due to higher rates or our own underwriting decisions 
in addition  in we were able to convert a substantial majority of our remaining occurrence policies to claims made policies 
first year claims made coverage has a significantly lower premium than occurrence coverage due to lower loss exposure  and the conversion reduced premiums written as compared to by approximately million 
the increase in personal lines gross premiums written reflects a million increase in auto premiums  primarily due to increases in the number and value of autos insured 
homeowner premiums increased by million due to higher premium rates and increases in the number and value of insured homes 
premiums earned year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands premiums earned professional liability    personal lines    premiums are earned pro rata over the entire policy period generally one year after the policy is written 
the increase in earned premiums therefore reflects on a pro rata basis the changes in written premiums that occurred during both and premiums ceded year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands premiums ceded professional liability    personal lines    under reinsurance contracts that became effective in october  our retention levels for insured medical liability events became million in all states whereas previously our retention in many states was as low as  the change in retention reduced premiums ceded in our professional liability segment in  both in total dollars and as a percentage of premiums earned 
additionally in  as discussed in more detail under losses and loss adjustment expenses we reduced our estimates of certain prior year gross losses  as well as the related reinsurance recoveries 
some of our reinsurance agreements adjust the premium due to the reinsurer based upon the losses reimbursed under the agreement 
consequently the estimate of ultimate ceded premiums was reduced by million as a result of this change 
personal lines premiums ceded increased due to the increased volume of our business and increased rates charged by our reinsurers 
losses and loss adjustment expenses net losses the following table summarizes net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
the net loss ratios shown are calculated by dividing the applicable net losses by calendar year net premiums earned 
in thousands net loss december  december  ratio net loss net loss increase net losses ratio net losses ratio decrease net losses calendar year professional liability   personal lines   net losses current accident year professional liability   personal lines   change in prior accident year losses favorable professional liability  personal lines   current accident year net losses for the professional liability segment have increased in as compared to by million or 
there is little change in the number of insured risks during as compared to  net losses increased during primarily because of higher loss costs 
the current accident year net loss ratio for the year ended december  decreased to as compared to for the same period in the loss ratio is lower than the ratio because premium rates increased at a faster pace than did loss costs 
personal lines current accident year net losses are million higher than losses  a increase 
net losses increased in primarily due to growth in the number of insureds but also due to higher loss costs for auto liability coverages and higher homeowner losses from an isolated ice storm and the august midwestern power outage 
the current accident year net loss ratios for reflect the beneficial effect of rate increases  which were more than offset by the previously listed increases to loss costs 
change in prior accident year losses and change in ddr reserves we decreased our estimate of professional liability prior year net losses by  in and increased our estimates by million in these adjustments were in response to actuarial evaluations of loss reserves performed during the period 
no significant change was made to our estimates of the reserves required for death  disability and retirement during or in our personal lines segment  we reduced net losses by million in and million in as a result of favorable developments in our estimates of prior years auto liability reserves 
we established initial reserves  particularly liability reserves  at levels that considered our estimates of rising costs and unpredictable litigation trends 
more favorable results are recognized if and when they materialize 
gross losses and reinsurance recoveries year ended december increase decrease in thousands gross losses professional liability segment    personal lines segment    reinsurance recoveries professional liability segment    personal lines segment    net losses professional liability segment    personal lines segment    our actuarial analysis of our professional liabilities reserve indicates that our claims severity has continued to increase as expected in our retained layers 
however  we have not experienced the high level of losses in our reinsured layers that we originally anticipated and for which we established reserves 
accordingly we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross loss and loss adjustment expenses by approximately million during the year ended december  since these losses were reinsured  we reduced expected reinsurance recoveries by approximately the same amount 
the reduction of million for prior accident years more than offset current accident year recoveries of million  thus creating a non traditional relationship between gross losses and recoveries for these changes in estimates had a nominal effect on net losses 
assumptions used in establishing our reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
net investment income and net realized investment gains losses our net investment income is primarily derived from the interest income earned by our fixed maturity securities but also includes interest income from short term and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts  and rental income earned by our commercial real estate holdings 
investment fees and expenses and real estate expenses are deducted from investment income 
our consolidated net investment income for is comprised of the following increase increase decrease decrease in thousands net investment income professional liability segment    personal lines segment   not attributed to segments the decrease in our net investment income in as compared to is primarily due to lower fixed maturity yields 
prevailing market interest and equity yields were at historically low levels throughout and the low market rates available for the investment of new and matured funds have reduced average yields 
as a result  net investment income is lower even though our average invested funds increased 
our average tax equivalent income yield of our fixed maturity investments is for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in also  in the fourth quarter of we sold a significant portion of our fixed maturity portfolio in order to realize capital gains and these proceeds were reinvested during at substantially lower rates 
investment income is a more substantial revenue source for the professional liability segment than for the personal lines segment 
the professional liability segment writes  and therefore collects  significantly more premiums and those premiums are collected some years before the related losses are paid 
in the personal lines segment  the length of time between the collection of premiums and the settlement of claims is generally short 
the decline in yields has had a more pronounced effect on our professional liability segment because the professional liability segment holds significantly more investments than the personal lines segment 
at december  the professional liability segment held fixed maturity securities having a book value of billion  the personal lines segment held fixed maturity securities having a book value of million 
the components of net realized investment gains losses are shown in the following table 
year ended december in thousands net gains losses from sales   other than temporary impairment losses  trading portfolio gains losses net realized investment gains losses   underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses are comprised of variable costs  such as commissions and premium taxes that are directly related to premiums earned  and fixed costs that have no direct relationship to premium volume  such as salaries  benefits  facility costs and guaranty fund assessments 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses by segment for the years ending december  and are as follows expense ratio year ended december year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses professional liability    personal lines    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in in both segments primarily because of higher variable costs  due largely to additional commission expense incurred as a result of premium growth 
in the professional liability segment  the increased premium related costs were offset by a million reduction in guaranty fund assessments 
also  late in the second quarter of we ceased to provide medical credentialing services 
expenses associated with this business activity were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  in our personal lines segment  the increase in premium related costs was partially offset by a decline in the amount of mandatory statutory assessments 
our underwriting expense ratio decreased in the professional liability segment because there was no significant change in our fixed costs  other than the previously discussed decrease in guaranty fund assessments  while premiums earned increased significantly in the personal lines ratio is lower for due to operating efficiencies and a decrease in mandatory statutory assessments 
guaranty fund assessments vary widely from year to year 
guaranty fund assessments totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the increase results from higher costs during the third and fourth quarters of as compared to because the debentures issued in july carried a higher rate than did the bank term loan and because the total outstanding amount of debt increased 
management elected to replace the term loan with the debentures because the debentures provided a longer term source of capital at a fixed interest rate 
interest expense was lower in the first six months of as compared to because both the average outstanding balance on the term loan and the variable interest rate on the term loan were lower in taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is from tax exempt interest and dividends 
the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below 
year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate minority interest minority interest in both and relates entirely to the minority interest in the income of meemic holdings 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources and financial condition we purchased this minority interest on january  in  earnings were allocable to the minority interest only for the period from january to january in  earnings were allocable to the minority interest for the entire period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   our fair value investment in fixed maturity securities was  million 
these securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have not and currently do not intend to enter into derivative transactions 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
we believe we are in a position to keep our fixed income investments until maturity as we do not invest in fixed maturity securities for trading purposes 
portfolio change in modified portfolio modified value value duration value duration interest rates millions millions years millions years basis point rise   basis point rise   current rate   basis point decline   basis point decline   current rates are as of december  and at december   the fair value of our investment in preferred stocks was million  including net unrealized gains of thousand 
preferred stocks are primarily subject to interest rate risk because they bear a fixed rate of return 
the investments in the above table do not include preferred stocks 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed income portfolio consisted of securities rated investment grade 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  in the current environment even investment grade securities can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million  which included net unrealized gains of million and net holding gains of approximately thousand 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
a hypothetical increase in the market prices as of december  would increase the fair value of these securities to million  a hypothetical decrease in the price of each of these marketable securities would reduce the fair value to million 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst scenarios
