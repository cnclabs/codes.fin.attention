item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereof appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report  on form k  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws 
actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of certain factors set forth in the section below entitled factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
while the national economy has largely recovered from the recession of the late s and early s  massachusetts local economy continues to lag behind 
job growth remains sluggish 
vacancy rates for downtown office space are nearly  and similar vacancy rates are seen in suburban areas 
in the face of these economic realities  the partnership has kept its residential vacancy rate below the local industry average 
however  doing so has required incentives such as lower rent  and payment of rental commissions 
additionally  new housing product in the residential market and low mortgage interest rates that attracted first time home buyers resulted in higher turnover in the portfolio and  in turn  higher turnover expenses and unit renovation costs 
finally  with a rise in utility rates  and in abnormally cold winter and higher than expected snowfall  increases in operating expenses outpaced any modest increases  in rental revenue that the partnership s properties may have experienced 
the partnership expects similar conditions to prevail in revenue is expected to remain flat while increases in operating expenses are expected to be muted 
competition continues to be strong  there has been no change in fundamental conditions that would shift the burden of paying rental commissions from the partnership to the tenants or mitigate high tenant turnover 
as a result  the partnership s future earnings may be negatively impacted 
lastly  tax reform allowed the partnership to accelerate depreciation on improvements and acquisitions over the past few years 
the tax incentives expired in  and  as such  we expect income taxable to partners to increase for the partnership has retained the hamilton company hamilton to manage and administer the partnership s properties 
hamilton is a full service real estate management company  which has legal  construction  maintenance  architectural and administrative departments 
the partnership s properties and the investment properties represent approximately of the total properties and of the residential properties managed by hamilton 
substantially all of the other properties managed by hamilton are owned wholly or partially  directly or indirectly by harold brown 
the partnership s second amended and restated contract of limited partnership the partnership agreement expressly provides that the general partner may employ a management company to manage the properties  and that such management company may be paid a fee of of rental receipts for administrative and management services the management fee 
the partnership annually pays hamilton the full management fee  in monthly installments 
mr 
brown  his brother ronald brown  and the president of hamilton  carl valeri  collectively own approximately of the depositary receipts representing the partnership class a units including depositary receipts held by trusts for the benefit for such persons family members 
harold brown also owns of the partnership s class b units  of the capital stock of newreal  inc newreal  the partnership s sole general partner  and all of the outstanding capital stock of hamilton 
ronald brown also owns of the partnership s class b units and of newreal s capital stock 
in addition  ronald brown is the president and director of newreal  and harold brown is newreal s treasurer and also a director 
two of newreal s other directors  thomas raffoul and conrad digregorio also own immaterial amounts of the partnership s class a units 
beyond the management fee  the partnership agreement further provides for the employment of outside professionals to provide services to the partnership and allows newreal to charge the partnership for the cost of employing professionals and others to assist with the administration of the partnership s properties 
in addition to the management fee  from time to time the partnership pays hamilton for repair and maintenance services  legal services  construction services and accounting services 
the costs charged by hamilton for these services are at the same hourly rate charged to all entities managed by hamilton  and management believes such rates are competitive in the marketplace 
payments to hamilton accounted for approximately and of the repair and maintenance expenses paid by the partnership in and  respectively 
of the funds paid to hamilton for this purpose  the great majority was to cover the cost of services provided by the hamilton maintenance department  including plumbing  electrical  carpentry and snow removal services 
however  several of the larger partnership properties have their own maintenance staff and use hamilton s services infrequently 
further  those properties that do not have their own maintenance staff but are located more than a reasonable distance from hamilton s headquarters in allston  massachusetts are generally serviced by local  independent companies 
hamilton s legal department handles most of the partnership s eviction and collection matters 
additionally  it prepares most long term commercial lease agreements and represents the partnership in selected purchase and sale transactions 
overall  hamilton provided approximately of the legal services paid for by the partnership in and approximately of such services during r 
brown partners  which is owned by ronald brown  manages the condominium units located in brookline  massachusetts 
that entity will receive annual management fees from the five units of approximately  and hamilton will reduce its management fees to approximately  so that the total management fee will not exceed the allowed by the partnership s partnership agreement 
the partnership requires that three bids be obtained for construction contracts in excess of  hamilton may be one of the three bidders on a particular project and may be awarded the contract if its bid and its ability to successfully complete the project are deemed appropriate 
for contracts that are not awarded to hamilton  hamilton charges the partnership a construction supervision fee equal to of the contract amount 
hamilton s architectural department also provides services to the partnership on an as needed basis 
in and  hamilton provided all of the construction services and architectural services paid for by the partnership  including approximately  for the construction of additional residential units at westgate apartments in woburn  massachusetts 
prior to  the partnership employed an outside  unaffiliated company to perform its bookkeeping and accounting functions 
since that time  such services have been provided by hamilton s accounting staff  which consists of approximately ten people 
hamilton currently charges the partnership  per year  per quarter for bookkeeping and accounting services 
for more information on related party transactions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires the partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates  including those related to acquiring  developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures 
the partnership bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
the partnership s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material effect on the partnership s financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues from rental properties are recognized when due from tenants 
residential leases are generally for terms of one year  and commercial leases are generally for to years  with renewal options at increased rents 
significant commercial leases with stepped increases over the term of the lease are recorded on the straight line basis 
real estate and depreciation real estate assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value  less accumulated depreciation 
costs related to the acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized  including interest  internal wages and benefits  real estate taxes and insurance 
capitalization usually begins with commencement of development activity and ends when the property is ready for leasing 
replacements and improvements such as hvac equipment  structural replacements  windows  appliances  flooring  carpeting  kitchen bath replacements and renovations are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives as follows depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
in assessing estimated useful lives  the partnership makes assumptions based on historical experience acquired from both within and outside the partnership 
these assumptions have a direct impact on the partnership s net income 
ordinary repairs and maintenance  such as unit cleaning and painting and appliance repairs  are expensed 
if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in the value of a property  the partnership s policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the property 
if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the property  the partnership would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to the amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
the partnership has not recognized an impairment loss since rental property held for sale and discontinued operations when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the partnership discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs  of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
properties identified as held for sale and or sold are presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
investments in partnerships the partnership accounts for its owned investment properties under the equity method of accounting  as we exercise significant influence over  but does not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in partnerships  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings  cash contributions and distributions 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the partnership is included on the consolidated statements of income 
with respect to investments in and advances to the investment properties  the partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
legal proceedings the partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise  from time to time  in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
if it is determined that a loss is likely to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine
