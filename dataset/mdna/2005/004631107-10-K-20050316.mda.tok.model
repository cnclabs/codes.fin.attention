item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in march  we sold two of our stations  kplr tv serving the st 
louis marketplace and kwbp tv  serving the portland  oregon marketplace  to subsidiaries of the tribune company for an aggregate  all cash  consideration of million plus a payment for the closing date working capital of the st 
louis station in the amount of approximately million 
the results relating to these two stations have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the nine television stations that comprise our continuing operations are regionally diverse and range in market size based on television households from through in the nation 
all but one of our stations are affiliates of the wb television network 
our second station in the albuquerque santa fe marketplace is a upn affiliate 
our nine stations have only been on the air  or achieving measurable ratings  for years 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national advertisers 
our revenues depend on popular programming that attracts audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  allowing us to sell advertising time at satisfactory rates 
like all commercial television stations  our rates are directly affected by the number of and demographic makeup of our viewing audience  as measured by nielsen media research 
our revenues also depend significantly on factors such as the national and local economy and the level of local competition 
approximately of our revenues are derived from programming that airs between the hours of pm to midnight  monday through sunday 
network prime time  which is a subset of this daypart  accounts for of our total revenues 
our average broadcast season mid september to mid september ratings amongst adults aged years old in this pm to midnight daypart  based on the average of the three major sweeps ratings periods november  february and may of each broadcast season  grew steadily until the most recently completed season 
excluding madison  which we acquired in december  our weighted average rating in this demographic for the daypart was for the season  a rating for the season and a rating for the season 
including madison  our weighted average adult year old average ratings for this daypart was a rating for the season and a rating for the season  representing a season over season decline 
our november weighted average ratings in this pm midnight period amongst adults declined from the november ratings period 
we believe these recent ratings declines  while not limited to our prime time daypart  are attributable mostly to the decline in the wb network s prime time ratings and the impact that such a drop  in our highest viewed daypart  has upon the surrounding dayparts 
our stations are generally ranked either fifth or sixth in their markets in terms of either our share of viewers or our share of the market s broadcast television revenue 
in periods of lower advertising demand such as has been the case for much of the past three years competition from market leaders  generally the abc  cbs  nbc and fox affiliated stations  increases as these stations become more aggressive in price to maintain their revenue share 
over the past several years  biennial political spending in the even years has seen dramatic growth 
while we do not directly benefit from this political advertising since most campaigns target older viewers than we generally deliver  we indirectly benefit as the increased demand has the effect of increasing pricing for non political advertising as overall inventory available to these advertisers in each market declines 
the year will see a significant reduction in overall television market revenues  as record political advertising revenues in will not recur in due to the lack of any significant elections 
like the television advertising business in general  our revenues are usually highest during the fourth quarter of each year  primarily due to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season consumer spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
we generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and to national sales representatives on national advertising 
our revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for commissions payable to advertising agencies and national sales representatives 
our primary ongoing operating expenses are costs of services  selling  general and administrative expenses  corporate expenses and depreciation and amortization and  in and  expenses related to impairments in our broadcast licenses 
costs of services include programming costs  which consist primarily of amortization of broadcast rights relating to syndicated programs as well as costs associated with our morning news show  the daily buzz which  as of january   is jointly produced by us and emmis  which is accounted for as a variable interest entity  and which effectively reduces our costs in half for this program and music rights fees 
other costs of service include advertising expenses targeted at viewers  which is net of any reimbursement received or due to us for such advertising and promotion from the wb network  upn or from other program suppliers  and engineering and transmission related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries  sales commissions to account executives  ratings service expenses  insurance and various related overhead expenses 
corporate expenses reflect costs of corporate management  which includes senior management and other centralized management support staff  along with investor relations expenses  professional fees  directors and officers insurance and other related corporate overhead 
in the fall of  we began to experience a noticeable slowdown in non political advertiser demand 
by december  it was clear that there was a dramatic weakness in demand affecting all media related companies and there were broader indications that the us economy was in a slowdown 
this slack demand continued through all of  and the resultant effect of the events of september  only made a tough year worse 
by industry accounts  television revenues declined approximately over  the steepest decline in the last years 
nearly every publicly traded television broadcaster  including us  posted year over year declines in advertising revenues 
advertising demand began to rebound early in and by the end of the year  aided by robust political advertising demand in most markets  year over year gains in most of our markets averaged approximately 
in march  operation freedom commenced in iraq and advertising demand was adversely affected for several weeks 
overall  there was only a modest growth in non political advertising revenues in for our markets 
while most expected that calendar would reflect an improved operating environment compared to  despite record breaking political advertising  non political advertising revenues increased only for the entire year 
heading into  advertising demand especially on the national front seems to have weakened compared to the fourth quarter of and the year earlier periods 
we believe this is due to a number of factors  including continued consolidation of advertisers and their advertising budgets  a continued uneven economic recovery and the possible redirecting of advertising budgets to other television and non television media 
although we still believe our stations are not fully capturing their appropriate share of market revenues and therefore still have room to increase their shares  given the relatively weak market and the recent declines in our ratings and in market shares  we expect to be our most challenging year since results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  in calendar year our station group achieved revenue gains despite a modest decline in our viewership shares and relatively sluggish market conditions apart from another strong political advertising year 
the growth in our net revenues was attributable to the combined growth in underlying non political market revenues and a growth in our station group s share of those revenues 
our revenue growth exceeded the growth in our costs of services  excluding depreciation and amortization  and allowed us to continue to narrow our operating losses compared to calendar net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  programming expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s programming expense of million 
this increase was attributable primarily to our continued investment in programming  including malcolm in the middle which launched in syndication in september at four of our stations and an increase in in the write down of program rights to adjust to net realizable value of million compared to other costs of services increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased utilities and operating lease expenses relating to the roll out of digital transmissions at several of our stations during and sg a expenses decreased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
this decrease in sg a relates primarily to reduced metering costs in one of our stations due to another station in the market participating in the costs of such meters 
corporate expenses for increased to million from million in this increase in corporate expenses was due primarily to increased costs related to our implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act relating to our internal controls 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for this increase reflects our continued capital expenditures over the past two years in connection with the conversion to digital  and more recently  to hdtv  and to our facility upgrades at our madison station 
in  we wrote off million in costs associated with our efforts to secure a construction permit for a television station in the richmond  virginia market as we determined that it was not likely going to be issued by the federal communications commission 
impairment of broadcast licenses for was million compared to an impairment expense of million in both impairment charges reflected lower valuations for certain of our smaller market station licenses 
interest expense for was million compared to million for this million decrease in interest expense reflects the redemption in of our senior discount notes due the television notes and our senior secured notes the intermediate notes with the proceeds from the sale of our st 
louis and portland stations 
we incurred a tax expense of million in compared to a tax expense of million in the tax expense in both years primarily relate to deferred tax liabilities associated with amortization of intangibles for tax purposes 
our loss from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was approximately  and related primarily to additional state taxes payable attributable to the gain on the sale of our discontinued operations  net of a remittance from the buyer of those stations of state tax nol benefits they received subsequent to the march closing 
our income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million  which included a pre tax gain on sale of assets of million 
pre tax income from operations of discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  calendar marked an important year for us as we completed the sale of our st 
louis and portland stations which enabled us to substantially reduce our total debt  thereby significantly reducing future interest expense 
also  for the first time  our net revenue for our continuing stations exceeded our costs of services  exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  on a same station basis  excluding the results of our madison acquisition in same station basis  our revenues increased 
these revenue gains primarily reflect our ratings gains over the past year along with modest market revenue gains during based on third party market audits performed in seven of our eight markets excluding the green bay market  where no audit is performed  our weighted average non political revenue share grew to approximately in and the overall weighted average growth in non political advertising dollars in these same markets grew compared to programming expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s programming expenses of million 
on a same station basis  programming expenses increased 
programming costs have increased primarily due to better and more expensive syndicated programming eg that s show and king of queens added to our schedules over the past eighteen months and increased programming costs related to our three hour morning news show  the daily buzz  which was on the air for a full year in compared to four months in other costs of services increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
on a same station basis  other costs of services increased  which was attributable to increased utilities and operating lease expenses relating to our new digital transmissions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
on a same station basis  sg a expenses increased 
this increase in sg a relates primarily to added sales staff  increased customer incentive trip expense and higher nielsen ratings expenses 
we expect the growth in the combined costs of services and sg a expenses to moderate in as future program upgrades will be mostly offset by expiring licenses on earlier syndication product  our costs to produce the daily buzz have been essentially halved effective january  through our joint venture arrangement with emmis and we will have more favorable year to year comparisons in our sales and engineering costs as the growth in these areas slows 
corporate expenses for decreased to million from million in this decrease in corporate expenses was due primarily to reductions in salary  incentive compensation and related expenses  professional fees and directors and officers insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for this increase of approximately  primarily reflects our investment in capital equipment in connection with our digital transmission facilities over the past eighteen months  which as of december   we have substantially completed 
interest expense for the current year was million compared to million for we redeemed all of our television notes on april  and our intermediate notes on april  and september  with proceeds from the tribune transaction and borrowings under its senior credit facility 
in connection with these early extinguishments of debt  we incurred an expense of million 
based on our total debt at december   including our capital lease obligations  and the effective interest rates at that date  and excluding any new borrowings in  our projected annualized cash interest expense is approximately million 
we incurred a tax expense of million in compared to million in the tax expense in relates primarily to increases in deferred tax liabilities 
the tax expense in relates primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance required as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of our income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million  which included a pre tax gain on sale of assets of million 
pre tax income from operations of discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to pre tax income for the twelve months ended december  of million 
liquidity and capital resources prior to  we carried a high level of debt arising from the issuance of our television notes and intermediate notes in september largely due to our desire to significantly reduce our debt levels  we sold our biggest stations to tribune in march and during redeemed substantially all of our long term debt 
in august  after our tribune transaction  we amended and restated our senior credit agreement with our lenders to extend the facility s maturity date to july   provide for slightly higher interest rates and amend our financial covenants  which include quarterly tests for minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  maximum leverage ratios  minimum tangible net worth and annual tests for maximum capital expenditures 
in november  we amended our senior credit facility again and simultaneously completed a new million second lien term loan facility sltl 
the senior credit facility was amended to increase the maximum borrowings thereunder to million  reduce the borrowing rates  provide us the ability to repurchase up to million of our common stock  extend the term to november and amend and eliminate certain of our financial covenants 
the sltl matures in may  and bears interest at libor plus  with interest payable quarterly 
the financial covenants in both agreements are limited to a quarterly tests for minimum trailing twelve month ebitda  b an annual test for maximum capital expenditures and c a covenant that the combined outstanding borrowings under both the revolver and the sltl facility will not exceed of the company s most recent lender approved appraised valuation of our stations 
in march  given the recent decline in our ratings and in market viewing shares and the relatively weak advertising demand in our markets  we amended our quarterly ebitda covenants with both our senior credit facility and sltl lenders 
we expect to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants for the period 
the ebitda covenants were not amended and the company does not expect that it will be in compliance with those covenants beginning on march  accordingly  the company expects that before march  it will be required to either negotiate new covenants for both facilities for and beyond or find new financing to replace these facilities 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful completing these amendments to our current credit facilities 
if we cannot either amend or  alternatively  replace these facilities  we might need to sell one or more of our stations to provide us with the liquidity and financing options required 
in  inclusive of cash interest expense  cash used in operating activities was approximately million and cash used in investing activities  principally consisting of station related capital expenditures  was million 
while we are striving to reduce our cash usage for operating and investing activities  we are  in the meantime  a net borrower in and will likely be a net borrower in net cash used in operating activities was million for compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for  a decrease in use of cash of million 
the decreased use was primarily due to reduced cash interest expense of million  a reduction in taxes paid of  and increased net revenue in excess of cash costs of service 
net cash used in investing activities was million for compared to million for the million increase in net cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase in capital expenditures in of million due primarily to our new transmission facilities in madison and the upgrade to full hdtv capabilities at four of our stations and a decrease in proceeds from sale of assets 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million as we funded our operating and investing activities  along with the million in repurchases of our stock  through increased borrowings under our credit facilities 
our net cash used by financing activities in was million as we repaid all of our long term notes from the proceeds of the tribune transaction and repaid million in capital lease obligations of our continuing stations in net cash used by discontinued operations in was approximately  which represented state tax payments net of the receipt of additional consideration from the tribune company related to state loss carryovers that they realized subsequent to the sale date 
net cash provided in by discontinued operations of million included the million purchase consideration for the sale of our stations to tribune plus cash provided from operations and working capital of the sold stations prior to the closing date  net of transaction costs and taxes paid 
the million in cash provided by discontinued operations in was from the full year operations of the stations sold 
as of december   the balances due under our revolving credit facility and sltl were approximately million and million  respectively  and we were in compliance with the covenants of both credit agreements 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at that date was for the revolving credit facility and for the sltl 
we had million remaining available for borrowing at december  under our revolving credit facility 
at december   amounts due under all capital lease facilities totaled  bearing an implicit average interest rate of per annum 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional capital expenditures in  primarily related to our remaining hdtv upgrades and for routine capital expenditures at our stations 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and negative working capital of million 
before considering any possible future acquisition  including the pending construction permit  in lexington  kentucky  during at least the next twelve months it will be necessary for us to continue to borrow under our senior credit facility as the cash generated from our station operations does not offset our projected capital expenditures  cash corporate expenses and cash interest costs 
the fcc issued the construction permit for flint  michigan in and we have entered into an agreement to sell that construction permit to a third party at a price of million 
the fcc has approved this transfer and we expect to close this transaction simultaneously with our purchase of the construction permit from the original applicants for million in april  yielding a cash gain of approximately million 
we expect that any future acquisitions and related capital expenditures of television stations  including any relating to our construction permit in lexington  ky  if granted by the fcc  would be financed through our revolver  a possible new capital lease line and  if necessary  through additional debt and equity financings 
although we believe it would be a secondary alternative  we also believe we have the ability to sell select stations in the event of unforeseen credit difficulties  such as might be experienced if there were further declines in the us economy or in advertising demand  or if our ratings continue to decline 
there is no guarantee that such other means of raising capital will be at terms acceptable to us  and accordingly current stockholders could be adversely affected by such financings 
certain factors that may effect future results and financial condition the following factors could have a material and adverse impact on our business the developmental nature of our continuing stations poses risks to stockholders  including the following we have not generated positive operating cash flow from our continuing operations and our future performance will depend upon our ability to continue increasing our ratings and revenues in a relatively healthy advertising environment  our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions might be impeded  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and our ability to withstand competitive pressures is limited 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from advertisers in diverse industries 
if a number of our advertisers continue to reduce their expenditures because of the current or a future general economic downturn  or an economic downturn in one or more industries or regions  or for any other reason  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not meet our interest obligations under either our amended senior revolving credit facility or our second lien term loan facility  fail to amend the quarterly ebitda covenants for and beyond  or if we otherwise default under these agreements  this debt may be accelerated 
in addition  because of our leverage  we may be less able to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow under an amended  restructured or new revolving credit agreement to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego acquisitions 
these alternative strategies would likely not be effected on satisfactory terms  if effected at all 
most of the programming we air and derived revenues from is either provided by our networks the wb in the case of eight of our stations and upn in the case of the ninth or from rerun syndication product 
if any of our network affiliation agreements are not renewed by the networks  if the wb or upn networks decline in popularity  or if the pricing for rerun syndication product increases  our ratings could decline or our costs increase which could adversely affect our financial performance 
in addition  as most rerun syndication programming is purchased well in advance of it becoming available for our stations to air  we are at risk of such acquired programming not achieving the expected ratings and the possibility that the revenues generated by such programs will not recoup the contractual programming costs 
both the wb network and upn are unprofitable 
if their parent companies decide to discontinue these operations or shut them down  our stations values would be adversely affected 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and an adverse change in our performance or in economic conditions within our markets could lead to future impairments that could negatively affect our operating results 
we have incurred net losses from continuing operations in each of our fiscal years since inception and expect to continue to experience net losses during the coming year or two 
such losses might make it difficult to refinance or replace credit facilities should we be required to replace them 
our plans to acquire additional television stations during the past several years have been adversely affected by our increased leverage resulting from a decline in our broadcast cash flow and the related constraints in borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
although we will have significantly reduced our debt through the sale of our discontinued operations  we will still need to borrow under a senior credit facility to successfully execute and implement additional station acquisitions 
our inability to secure such financing could limit our future growth 
furthermore  our ability to acquire additional television stations is affected by the following many competing acquirers have greater resources available to make such acquisitions than we have desired stations might not be available for purchase  we might not have the financial resources necessary to acquire additional stations  we might be unable to obtain fcc approval of the assignments or transfers of control of fcc licenses  and current fcc rules limit the number of television broadcasting properties that any one person or entity  including its affiliates  may own in any given market which could limit our ability to pursue desired stations 
generally when we sign acquisition agreements  we enter into interim local marketing agreements with the seller under which we receive some or all of station revenues and pay proportionate station expenses 
because the seller retains ultimate programming control  we bear the economic risks of paying station expenses until closing the acquisition 
mr 
kellner s consulting agreement provides that  while an officer of company  he may perform services for other businesses unaffiliated with ours that  in certain limited circumstances  may be competitive 
because of mr 
kellner s experience in the television broadcast industry  if mr 
kellner provides services to a competing business  it could materially affect our operations 
additionally  although mr 
kellner s consulting agreement requires him to devote his time  attention  knowledge and skills to fulfill his duties as our chairman and chief executive officer  it does not require a minimum time commitment 
all of our continuing television stations are relatively new in their markets and are still developing 
many of them have never generated positive cash flow from operations and the group  as a whole and including corporate expense  has never generated positive cash flow from operations 
our ability to service our debt and stay in compliance with our credit agreement is ultimately dependent on our generating positive cash flow from operations 
networks that air programming exclusively on cable and direct broadcast continue to increase their aggregate share of overall television viewers 
a continued decline in broadcast television viewership could result in reduced industry advertising revenues and adversely affect our business 
cable operators have become increasingly aggressive and successful in competing for local market advertising revenue as they have been able to upgrade sales capabilities and continue to offer more targeted viewer audiences 
this increased competition to local television broadcasters has  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our business 
emerging technologies such as personal video recorders pvr that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
the pvr penetration rate has increased dramatically over recent years and the likelihood of direct broadcast and cable services including such devices for nominal fees in their next generation set top boxes will likely drive pvr penetration rates further 
advertisers and agencies are increasingly raising their concerns that this new technology is reducing the value of their commercial messages 
the fcc requires that all stations stop using analog signals on the stations by as of year end  television sets with digital receivers were only present in approximately of us television households  and accordingly  we are unable to predict the extent of consumer demand for digital television will be or when that demand will arise 
if we are required to cease analog operations before viewers have converted to digital television  our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected 
contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations  by year of payment  in thousands  including the repayment of our revolving credit facility  and our sltl  are as follows year senior credit facility second lien term loan program rights obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations thereafter    total      includes commitments not recognized in our consolidated financial statements  as the underlying programming is not yet available for broadcast 
includes audience measurement service agreements  news service licenses  music license fees and various software license agreements 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we expect that our capital expenditures for  which are primarily related to our upgrade of transmission including digital facilities for our madison station  conversion to high definition broadcast capability at approximately half of our station group and routine capital expenditures will be approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to broadcast rights  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
programming rights our programming rights are stated  on a gross basis  at the lower of amortized cost or estimated realizable value 
we evaluate estimated realizable value of programming rights based on current usage and revenue performance and projected future revenue and usage of such programs 
changes in our programming schedule could impact the estimated realizable value of programming 
in addition  estimates of future revenue performance relate to the number of advertising spots we sell and the amount generated from such sales 
a decrease in the number of spots sold or the amount for such sales could also impact our estimated realizable value 
during  and  we recorded write downs of program rights due to impairments of   and  respectively 
the increase in the write down was due principally to an additional season extension of the drew carey show and lower future revenue expectations for that program and others 
impairment of long lived asset values the carrying values of our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis is based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the stations 
based on these estimates  we have not recorded any impairment related to long lived assets for  or future adverse changes in market conditions  changes in technology and other factors could reduce the expected future cash flows and result in an impairment charge

we did not record any impairment charges in  or the provisions of sfas no 
for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
revenue recognition we record revenue from the sale of airtime related to advertising and contracted time at the time of broadcast 
revenue and expenses associated with barter agreements in which broadcast time is exchanged for programming rights are recorded at the estimated average rate of the airtime exchanged 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we utilize information available to us  including the timing of payments and the financial condition of our customers  to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we do not have a significant concentration of accounts receivable from any single customer or industry segment 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas no 
also specifies criteria that must be met before intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination can be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead  tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of amended by sfas no 

we re evaluated our reporting units effective december  and determined that the appropriate level to test goodwill for impairment should be at the market level 
previously  we evaluated our goodwill on a consolidated basis 
based on our evaluations of goodwill including goodwill relating to discontinued operations at january   december   december  and december  our annual impairment testing date  there was no impairment of goodwill 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we determined that our identifiable intangible assets  which represent our broadcast licenses  have indefinite lives 
accordingly  we test these intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement and no longer amortize these intangibles effective january  at january  and december   we determined that the fair value of our intangible assets exceeded their carrying values and no impairment was recorded in as of december   we determined that one of our station s broadcast license had been impaired due to a decline in market conditions and we recorded a million impairment of that license 
at december   we determined that three of our station licenses had been impaired due to declines in market conditions and we recorded a million impairment of those licenses 
as of the date of adoption  january   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which was subject to the transition provisions of statements and apart from the aforementioned million and million impairments in and  respectively  no amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets was recorded for the years ended december   or impact of recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties  or the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
fin will have a significant effect on existing practice because it requires existing variable interest entities to be consolidated if those entities do not effectively disburse risks among parties involved 
in addition  fin contains detailed disclosure requirements 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
on december   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

in addition  fin r applies to all other variable interest entities created prior to february  by the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  our three months ended march  
this interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we are deemed the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with emmis communications  effective january   to produce the daily buzz  a weekday morning three hour television news show
