please read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group provides dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure 
as of december   we provided dialysis and ancillary services to over  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services to more than hospitals 
our net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources outpatient hemodialysis services  ancillary services associated with outpatient dialysis  primarily the administration of epo and other drugs  home dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services provided to acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  laboratory services  and management contracts with hospital based medical university dialysis programs 
most patients with esrd receive three dialysis treatments each week in an outpatient setting 
reimbursement for these services is provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates established by cms 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
neither congress nor cms approved an increase in the composite rate for  or the average revenue per treatment we receive from medicare and medicaid is less than our average cost per treatment 
management expects this situation to continue 
any reduction in medicare and medicaid payments or shift in our revenue mix toward medicare or medicaid reimbursement could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the medicare composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies used for the treatment  certain laboratory tests and medications  and most of the home dialysis services we provide 
we receive separate reimbursement outside the composite rate for some other services  drugs including specific drugs such as epo and some physician ordered tests  including laboratory tests  provided to dialysis patients 
if a patient has private health insurance  then that patient s treatment is typically reimbursed at rates significantly higher than those paid by medicare during the first months of care 
after that period  medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and is usually higher than medicare rates 
because 
table of contents dialysis is a life sustaining therapy to treat a chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our net revenue and net income from the administration of epo 
epo is manufactured by a single company  amgen  inc in april  amgen implemented its third epo price increase of in as many years 
because we were already under contract with amgen through  this price increase did not affect our results of operations during key components of the pricing formula were maintained in our contract with amgen 
therefore  while the price increase had an adverse effect on our results of operations  we were able to mitigate approximately of the increase 
amgen did not implement a price increase in  but changes in our contract with amgen for resulted in an increase in our cost of epo 
changes in our contract with amgen for along with changes in amgen s packaging practices for epo may result in an increase in our cost of epo in the estimated impact of these changes was incorporated and communicated in our corporate goals for in addition  congress mandated a change in the way we will be paid beginning in for some of the drugs  including epo  that we bill for outside of the flat composite rate 
this change will result in lower reimbursement for these drugs and a higher composite rate 
under recently adopted regulations  in we will be reimbursed for the top ten separately billable esrd drugs at average acquisition cost  and we will be reimbursed for other separately billable esrd drugs at the rate of average sales price plus 
in addition  the composite rate will be increased by in these regulations also include a case mix adjustment that will become effective in april and a geographic adjustment to the composite rate as well as a budget neutrality adjustment 
we believe these changes coupled with the increase in the medicare composite rate approved for will have a neutral effect on our revenue per treatment and earnings in critical accounting policies in december  the sec issued a financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
in accordance with that release  we have identified accounting policies that we consider critical to our business 
management identified these policies based on their importance to our consolidated financial statements and on the degrees of subjectivity and complexity involved in these policies 
in addition to these critical policies  a summary of significant accounting policies is included in our consolidated financial statements and related notes  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to net revenue and contractual provisions and provision for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue and contractual provisions we recognize revenue net of contractual provisions as services are provided and invoices for those services are issued 
contractual provisions represent the difference between our gross billed charges and the amount we expect to receive 
under the medicare esrd program  medicare reimbursement rates for outpatient dialysis treatments are fixed under a composite rate structure 
the composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including dialysis treatment  supplies  some laboratory 
table of contents tests and some medications 
there are other drugs  laboratory tests and services that are eligible for separate reimbursement outside the composite rate 
most state medicaid plans follow reimbursement methodologies that are similar to the medicare program  but other payors  particularly private insurance plans and managed care payors  reimburse us under contractual arrangements or based on our charges 
each of these payor sources presents unique challenges to the process of recording contractual provisions 
we have made significant investments in human resources and information systems to enable us to estimate the appropriate amount of contractual provisions as we provide services 
actual levels of reimbursement  however  are sometimes difficult to determine due to the complexity of the applicable regulations or contracts 
as a result  we may in fact collect more or less than the amount we expected when we provided and billed for the services 
in addition  regulations and contracts may be changed  making system updates and maintenance necessary for estimating net revenue accurately 
as a result  management may make adjustments to the contractual provisions estimated by the system based on actual collection experience and other factors 
provision for doubtful accounts collecting outstanding accounts receivable is critical to our success 
our primary source of collection risk is related to the portion of our charges for which the patient is responsible 
for medicare patients  the patients responsibility is of medicare allowable charges  and for other patients  the patients responsibility varies based on their health coverage 
we record an estimate of the provision for doubtful accounts in the period in which the revenue is recognized based on management s estimate of the net collectibility of the accounts receivable 
management estimates and monitors the net collectibility of accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors  including the analysis of payor mix  subsequent collection analysis and review of detailed agings of accounts receivable 
significant changes in our payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
self insurance accruals from time to time  we are subject to professional liability  general liability and workers compensation claims or lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintain insurance for professional liability and general liability claims exceeding certain individual amounts and for workers compensation claims exceeding certain individual and aggregate amounts 
we estimate the self insured retention portion of professional liability  general liability and workers compensation risks using third party actuarial calculations that include historical claims data  demographic factors and other assumptions 
the estimated accrual for professional liability  general liability and workers compensation claims could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
while management monitors current claims closely and considers outcomes when estimating its self insurance accruals  the complexity of the claims  the wide range of potential outcomes and changes in the legal climate often complicate our ability to make precise estimates 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually 
goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit based on the geographic location of assets acquired 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying amount  then the company compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  then an impairment loss is recognized for that difference 
no goodwill impairment losses were recognized during  or in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when events  circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying value of certain long lived assets and related identifiable intangible assets excluding goodwill that are expected to be held and used  might be impaired  we evaluate such assets for impairment based on estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
if related long lived assets are identified as impaired  the impairment is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by independent appraisals or estimates of discounted future cash flows 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial 
table of contents statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date for the change 
management identifies deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized and records a valuation allowance 
we also establish accruals for tax uncertainties that we deem to be probable of loss and that can be reasonably estimated 
results of operations the following table sets forth results of operations in thousands for the periods indicated and the percentage of net revenue represented by the respective financial line items year ended december  net revenue patient care costs general and administrative expenses provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest expense  net minority interest income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue increased from  million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the number of treatments we performed from  in to  in and a increase in the average patient revenue per dialysis treatment from in to in this growth in treatments was largely the result of our acquisition of nna in april and our other acquisitions  along with a increase in same market treatments for over the increase in patient revenue per treatment from was largely due to the impact of our annual price increase implemented in the fourth quarter of along with favorable renegotiations of some of our managed care contracts  increased utilization of some ancillary drugs  primarily epo  and the favorable resolution of several contractual issues with payors during this increase was partially offset by lower revenue per treatment in the former nna operations 
we expect our patient revenue per dialysis treatment to increase by between and in as a result of the price increase we implemented during the fourth quarter of  potentially offset by decreases in the utilization of certain ancillary drugs and changes in the medicare reimbursement process as a result of mma 
in addition  we expect a small net positive effect of renegotiating some of our managed care contracts 
patient care costs 
patient care costs consist of costs directly related to the care of patients  including direct labor  drugs and other medical supplies  and operational costs of facilities 
patient care costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due principally to the increase in the number of treatments performed during the period  which was reflected in corresponding increases in the use of labor  drugs and supplies 
patient care costs as a percentage of net revenue increased from in to in this increase was due to generally higher salary and benefit costs  lease costs and routine supply costs experienced in the former nna facilities 
patient care costs per treatment increased from in to in the increase in patient care costs per treatment was due to increases in the price and utilization of epo  increased labor costs  increases in the cost of insurance  increases in self insurance accruals  and changes in the utilization of certain ancillary drugs  as well as the higher cost structure in the former nna facilities 
management believes that the company will continue to face increases in the cost of labor and insurance in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include corporate office costs and other costs not directly related to the care of patients  including facility administration  accounting  billing and information systems 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in general and administrative expenses over was due to increased costs associated with the acquisitions that we closed in general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenue decreased from in to in as we leveraged our corporate functions over a larger base of revenue as a result of our acquisitions in and because general and administrative expenses for did not include the million charge we incurred in the first quarter of for a retirement benefit plan for our former chairman  chief executive officer and president 
general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of included write offs of expenses incurred in connection with several acquisitions that were not completed and the cost of complying with the subpoena we received from the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york 
provision for doubtful accounts 
management determines the provision for doubtful accounts as a function of payor mix  billing practices and other factors 
we reserve for doubtful accounts in the period when the revenue is recognized based on management s estimate of the net collectibility of the accounts receivable 
management estimates the net collectibility of accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  analyzing revenues generated from payor sources  performing subsequent collection testing and regularly reviewing detailed accounts receivable agings 
management makes adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as necessary based on the results of management s reviews of the net collectibility of accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts 
table of contents increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue decreased in to from in principally as a result of our improved collection experience 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due to the start up of dialysis facilities  the normal replacement costs of dialysis facilities and equipment  the purchase of information systems and the amortization of separately identifiable intangible assets associated with acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in principally as a result of nna s practice of leasing dialysis equipment under operating leases  which resulted in lower depreciation and amortization and higher patient care costs 
income from operations 
income from operations increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
income from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly from in to in period principally as a result of the acquisition of nna  which had generally lower margins than the company as a result of nna s lower revenue per treatment and higher patient care costs and other factors discussed above 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of substantially higher average borrowings in  which were associated with the completion of our program to repurchase million in common stock between november and march  our acquisitions and the assumption of nna s million senior subordinated notes 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the proportionate equity interest of other owners of entities that are not wholly owned but the financial results of which are included in our consolidated results 
minority interest as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in the change in minority interest expense as a percentage of revenue occurred as our recent acquisitions increased the percentage of our facilities that operate as joint ventures 
as of december   we were the majority and controlling owner in joint ventures  as compared to as of december  provision for income taxes 
income tax expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is a result of increases in pre tax earnings and our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was for the period compared to for the period 
the increase reflects a higher overall effective rate associated with the operations acquired from nna 
net income 
net income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was a result of the items discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the number of treatments we performed from  in to  in and a increase in the average patient revenue per dialysis treatment from in to in the growth in treatments was the result of the acquisition and development of various dialysis facilities and a increase in same market treatments for over we estimate that approximately of the increase in revenue per treatment in was attributable to the rate increase to private payors that we implemented during the fourth quarter of the remaining per treatment increase was the net result of both favorable and unfavorable payor contract resolutions 
during we experienced favorable payor contract resolutions of per treatment  which was offset by per treatments of unfavorable payor resolutions a portion of which relates to reduced reimbursement experienced with certain managed care contracts and reduced reimbursement in certain state medicaid programs 

table of contents patient care costs 
patient care costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of

patient care costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in patient care costs per treatment increased from in to in the increase in patient care costs per treatment was due to increases in the price of epo  labor costs  the cost of insurance  increases in self insurance accruals  and the utilization of certain ancillary drugs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to a million charge recorded in the first quarter of for a retirement benefit plan for our former chairman  chief executive officer and president that was adopted in january general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenue increased from in to in the charge for the retirement package accounted for substantially all of the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
provision for doubtful accounts

this increase was a result of the items discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we require capital primarily to acquire and develop dialysis centers  to purchase property and equipment for existing centers  to repurchase shares of our common stock and to finance working capital needs 
at december   our working capital was million  cash and cash equivalents were million  and our current ratio was to 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities consists of net income before depreciation and amortization expense  adjusted for changes in components of working capital  primarily accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of million of purchases of property and equipment and million of cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million  net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock  offset by million in repurchases of our common stock 
on february   we entered into a new credit agreement the agreement with a group of banks totaling up to million 
the agreement replaced our prior facilities 
the agreement has a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan facility and a million incremental term loan facility 
borrowings under the incremental term loan facility are subject to obtaining commitments from the banks and finalizing specific terms 
the revolving credit facility and the million term loan facility have a final maturity of february  each of our wholly owned subsidiaries has guaranteed all of our obligations under the agreement 
further  our obligations under the agreement  and our subsidiaries obligations under their guarantees  are secured by a pledge of the equity interests we hold in each of our subsidiaries 
the agreement includes financial covenants that are customary based on the amount and duration of the agreement 
borrowings under the million revolving credit facility may be used for acquisitions  repurchases of our stock  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes 
as of december   we can borrow up to million under the revolving credit facility but cannot borrow any additional amounts under either the million term loan facility or the million incremental term loan facility 
at december   our outstanding indebtedness was million  including an outstanding balance of million under the term loan facility  million under the revolving credit facility  million of senior subordinated notes assumed in the nna transaction and million of other indebtedness  primarily capital leases 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at variable rates determined by our leverage ratio 
these variable rate debt instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk  and we will face higher interest costs on this debt if interest rates rise 
effective june   we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on million of our term loan 
under these interest rate swap agreements we will exchange fixed and variable rate interest payments based on a million notional principal amount through march  the notional amount of million and an interest rate of are fixed in the agreements 
the changes in cash flows under these agreements are expected to offset the changes in interest rate payments attributable to fluctuations in libor 
the hedge is structured to qualify for the shortcut method  therefore  we record changes in the fair value of the agreement directly in other comprehensive income loss 
the interest payments under this agreement are settled on a net basis each calendar quarter 
the senior subordinated notes we assumed in the nna transaction bear interest at the rate of per annum on the face amount that was million at the date of acquisition 
as of december  these notes have a remaining face value of million and are recorded at their carrying value of million including the unamortized premium of million 
these notes do not provide for scheduled principal amortization and are scheduled to mature on november  each of our wholly owned subsidiaries has guaranteed all of our obligations under these notes 
the rights of the noteholders and our obligations under these notes are set forth in an indenture that nna entered into in october  which we assumed in connection with the nna acquisition 
the indenture includes customary financial covenants 
as a result of our indebtedness  we will incur substantial interest expense in and after based on our outstanding funded indebtedness of million  excluding the unamortized fair value premium of million on the senior subordinated notes  the aggregate maturities of our borrowings are as 
table of contents follows million  million  million  million  million  and thereafter million 
a significant component of our growth strategy is the acquisition and development of dialysis facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to close acquisition transactions with them on acceptable terms 
management believes that existing cash and funds from operations  together with funds available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our acquisition  expansion  capital expenditure and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  in order to finance certain large strategic acquisition opportunities  we may need to incur additional short and long term bank indebtedness or to issue equity or debt securities 
the availability and terms of any future financing will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional financing  if required  on acceptable terms 
we plan to make capital expenditures of between million and million in  primarily for equipment replacement  expansion of existing dialysis facilities and construction of de novo facilities 
we expect that these capital expenditures will be funded with cash provided by operating activities and our existing credit facility 
management believes that capital resources available to us will be sufficient to meet the needs of our business  both on a short and long term basis 
management  from time to time  determines the appropriateness of repurchasing common stock in accordance with a repurchase plan initially authorized by the board of directors in october in  we began repurchasing shares of our common stock by purchasing  shares of common stock for approximately million 
in  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
in october  we announced that the board of directors had approved an increase in the repurchase plan to allow the purchase of up to a total of million in common stock  and we announced that we intended to repurchase million in common stock between november  and march  during we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
during we repurchased million shares for million 
as of december   we had repurchased an aggregate of million shares under the plan  for a total of approximately million 
in january  the sec issued a financial reporting release  fr  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this release encourages public companies to give investors additional information about funds that will be required to operate their businesses in the future under agreements that are in place today 
in accordance with fr  the following table gives information about our existing contractual obligations 
at december   we had no significant contingent commitments 
payments due by period in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital leases operating leases medical director fee obligations total contractual cash obligations newly issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amended sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee 
table of contents stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july  as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adopting of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
impact of inflation a substantial portion of our net revenue is subject to reimbursement rates that are regulated by the federal government and do not automatically adjust for inflation 
we are unable to increase the amount we receive for the services provided by our dialysis business that are reimbursed under or by reference to the medicare composite rate 
increased operating costs due to inflation  such as labor and supply costs including the cost of epo  without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates  may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and business 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash balances we maintain all cash in united states dollars in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade instruments with maturities of less than three months  which we consider cash equivalents  therefore  the company has no market risk sensitive instruments 
outstanding debt as of december   we had outstanding debt of million  including a million fair value premium on the senior subordinated notes 
this debt consisted of million outstanding under the term facility in our credit agreement  million of indebtedness relating to the senior subordinated notes due and approximately million outstanding under various capital leases and notes payable 
borrowings of million under the term loan bear interest at variable rates based on libor rates or the prime rate that are determined by our leverage ratio 
the remaining million under the term loan are fixed at a rate of plus an additional spread based on the company s leverage ratio under interest rate swap agreements that became effective on june  our weighted average borrowing rate under the term loan as of december   was 
we expect this rate to rise in the future if interest rates rise on the portion that bears interest at floating rates 
outstanding senior subordinated notes bear nominal interest at on the million outstanding face amount of the notes 
the unamortized million fair value premium is being recognized over the life of the notes using the effective interest method and is recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
accordingly  the effective interest rate on the notes as of december  was 
at december   the fair value of our indebtedness under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes approximated carrying value 
at the december  borrowing levels and giving effect to the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  if there had been a increase in the variable interest rates  then our pre tax income would have decreased by approximately million for the year ended december
