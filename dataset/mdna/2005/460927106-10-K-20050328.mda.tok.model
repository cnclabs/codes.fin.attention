intervest bancshares corporation has three wholly owned subsidiaries intervest national bank  intervest mortgage corporation and intervest securities corporation hereafter referred to collectively as the company on a consolidated basis 
intervest bancshares corporation and intervest national bank may be referred to individually as the holding company and the bank  respectively 
intervest bancshares corporation also has four wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  intervest statutory trust i  ii  iii and iv 
for a discussion of the company s business  see item business in part i of this report 
the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and expenses  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
noninterest income consists mostly of loan and other banking fees as well as income from loan prepayments 
the amount and timing of  as well as income from  loan prepayments  if any  cannot be predicted and can fluctuate significantly 
normally  the number of instances of prepayment of mortgage loans tends to increase during periods of declining interest rates and tends to decrease during periods of increasing interest rates 
many of the company s mortgage loans include provisions relating to prepayment and others prohibit prepayment of indebtedness entirely 
noninterest expense consists of compensation and benefits expense  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing expenses  advertising expense  professional fees  insurance expense and other operating expenses 
the company s profitability is significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the company s loan portfolio has historically been concentrated in commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans  which represented of the total loan portfolio at december  the properties underlying the company s mortgages are also concentrated in new york state and the state of florida 
many of the new york properties are located in new york city and are subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents 
credit risk  which represents the possibility of the company not recovering amounts due from its borrowers  is significantly impacted by local economic conditions in the areas the properties are located  as well as the company s underwriting standards 
economic conditions affect the market value of the underlying collateral as well as the levels of occupancy of income producing properties 
additionally  terrorist acts  such as those that occurred on september   armed conflicts  such as the war on terrorism  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes  may have an adverse impact on economic conditions 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in its financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
the company believes that currently its most critical accounting policy relates to the determination of its allowance for loan losses  which is discussed in more detail in the section entitled allowance for loan losses 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements

the decrease reflected the deployment of a portion of those funds into loans and securities 
cash and cash equivalents include federal funds sold and interest bearing and noninterest bearing cash balances with banks  and other short term investments that have original maturities of three months or less 
the short term investments are normally comprised of commercial paper issued by large commercial banks  certificates of deposit and us government securities 
the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  calls of securities  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative investment opportunities 
security investments the company invests in securities after satisfying its liquidity objectives and lending commitments 
the company has historically only purchased debt securities that are issued by the us government or one of its agencies 
the company s investment policy is designed to provide and maintain liquidity  without incurring undue interest and credit risk 
the company s security investments have lower yields than its loan portfolio 
to manage interest rate risk  the company normally purchases securities that have adjustable rates or securities with fixed rates that have short to intermediate maturity terms 
the company does not engage in trading activities 
the company continues to invest in short term year u 
s government agency debt obligations to emphasize liquidity and to target intervest national bank s loan to deposit ratio at approximately 
securities that are held for indefinite periods of time which management intends to use as part of its asset liability management strategy  or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates or other factors  are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value 
there were no securities classified as available for sale at december  or securities for which the company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
such securities totaled  at december   compared to  at december  the increase was due to new purchases exceeding maturities and calls of securities during the year

at december  and  there were no other impaired loans or loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses increased to  at december   from  at december  and represented of total loans net of deferred fees outstanding at december   compared to at december  the increase in the allowance was due to provisions totaling  resulting from loan growth and a decrease in the credit grade of two loans during the year 
at december  and  the allowance was almost all allocated to commercial real estate loans  multifamily loans and land loans 
the following table sets forth information with respect to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended december  in thousands allowance at beginning of year    provision charged to operations    chargeoffs recoveries allowance at end of year    ratio of allowance to total loans  net of deferred fees total loans  net of deferred fees at year end    average loans outstanding during the year    the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the nature and size of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and commitments and estimates of fair value thereof  historical chargeoffs and recoveries  adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and management s perception of the current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s lending areas 
for calculation purposes  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of an unallocated portion which is derived from an estimated loss factor ranging from to multiplied by the principal amount of loans rated acceptable and higher percentages for loans that are assigned a credit grade of special mention or lower and  from time to time  an allocated or specific portion on certain loans particularly for loans that have been identified as being impaired as discussed below 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions  or other factors  differ from those previously assumed in the determination of the level of the allowance 
in addition  sfas no 
specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect both full principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
the company s policy is to charge off any portion of the recorded investment in the loan that exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis 
finally  the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination 
all other assets the following table sets forth the composition of the caption all other assets in the table on page at december  in thousands accrued interest receivable   loan fees receivable   premises and equipment  net   deferred income tax asset   deferred debenture offering costs  net   investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries  all other assets  accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the amount of loans  investments and other interest earning assets outstanding and the timing of interest payments received 
the increase was due to the growth in these assets 
loan fees receivable are fees due to the company in accordance with the terms of mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the increase was due to an increase in mortgage loan originations 
premises and equipment  which is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  increased due to net additions of  almost all of which were leasehold improvements associated with new office space  partially offset by depreciation and amortization 
the deferred income tax asset relates primarily to the unrealized tax benefit on the company s allowance for loan losses 
the allowance has been expensed for financial statement purposes but it is currently not deductible for income tax purposes until actual losses are incurred 
the increase in the deferred tax asset is a function of the increase in the allowance for loan losses during the period 
the deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the increase was due to a total of  of costs associated with issuing new debentures  partially offset by normal amortization during the period

regulatory capital the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies use five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premiums 
these categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the bank is required to maintain regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively 
at december  and  management believes the bank met its capital adequacy requirements and is a well capitalized institution as defined in the regulations  which require minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based ratios of  and  respectively

asset and liability management interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the company does note engage in trading or hedging activities  nor does it invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income and capital 
the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps or collars  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different than those assumed in the gap analysis 
the company s one year positive interest rate sensitivity gap remained relatively unchanged at  or of total assets  at december   compared to  or at december  for purposes of computing the gap  all deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
the behavior of core depositors may not necessarily result in the immediate withdrawal of funds in the event deposit rates offered by the bank did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year gap would have been a positive at year end  compared to a positive at year end many of the company s floating rate loans have a floor  or minimum rate  that is determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the effect on interest income of a falling rate environment because the interest rates on such loans do not reset downward 
notwithstanding all of the above  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis

recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities  and the issuance of its debentures 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management actively monitors and manages the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital
