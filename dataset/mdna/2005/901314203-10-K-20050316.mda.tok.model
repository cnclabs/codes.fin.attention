item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we were formed through the combination of media  inc and real media  inc in media  our legal and accounting predecessor  has been publicly traded since august real media was a privately held company that developed the first generation of our open adstream software and operated small advertising networks in the united states and europe 
following the downturn in the global economy and  in particular  the correction in the internet market  we executed a strategic plan to restructure our operations  focusing on our core businesses  including web representation  advertisement serving  analytics and search marketing services  and exited non core businesses 
in may  we divested exactis  an e mail business  sabela  an advertisement serving technology business  and awardtrack  an online promotions and purchase rewards business 
in january  we divested imake  a broadband convergence technology business and in may  we exited e mail marketing in the us by selling certain assets related to our us e mail management product 
in january  we sold ipromotions  an online promotions business and acquired insight first  inc  a provider of web analytics technology 
during  we acquired real media korea co 
ltd 
rmk  a provider of media and technology solutions in south korea  and decide holdings pty limited decide  a provider of search marketing services in europe and australia 
the foregoing acquisitions and dispositions may affect the comparability of our results from period to period 
we offer a comprehensive suite of media services and software products and services for the online advertising needs of web publishers and advertisers  including web representation  search engine marketing  online advertisement serving and analytics 
we work closely with web publishers and advertisers to implement integrated solutions to sell and deliver advertising on web sites and manage other critical operations including campaign planning  execution  measurement and analysis 
our web alliance of affiliated web sites aggregates internet advertising inventory and targets audience segments to attract advertisers worldwide 
through search  we connect advertisers with consumers who use search engines to find information  products and services 
our open adsystem technology helps web publishers and advertisers target  convert and retain online customers  maintain customer relationships and safeguard the privacy of web users 
we operate in three business segments media solutions  search solutions and technology solutions 
media solutions media we generate revenue from our media segment from fees paid by client advertisers for advertising impressions 
we typically offer advertisers a pricing model based on cost per thousand impressions cpm enabling a client advertiser to pay a fee based on the number of times its advertisement is viewed 
we typically count an advertising impression each time a request is made to our computer servers to transmit an advertisement to the web browser of a user 
we may charge higher cpms to advertisers that use advanced targeting solutions  such as our behavioral targeting solution  in comparison to those that use our content channel or run of network advertising solutions 
we pay web publishers included in the web alliance a royalty for the advertising inventory they make available to us 
the royalty generally does not exceed of the gross advertising revenue we generate from the web publisher s advertising inventory  but may be more for web publishers with larger numbers of historical and forecasted unique visitors  impressions and page views  and widely recognized brand names  among other factors 
on a very limited basis  we have generated revenue from e mail advertisements and marketing 
search solutions search we generate revenue from our search segment primarily from cost per click cpc fees paid by client advertisers when search engine users click through to their web sites as a result of our submission of their web site listings into search engine databases 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from fees paid by search engines that employ us to optimize the submission of web site listings and report on advertising campaigns for their advertisers 
we develop relationships with pay for placement and algorithmic search engines in order to provide search services to our client advertisers 
we refer to search engines we work with as search engine distribution partners 
our search services include campaign management 
prior to our acquisition of decide  we provided two primary services for advertisers running campaigns on pay for placement and algorithmic search engines that are now included in our managed account services 
these services include pay for placement 
for client advertisers running campaigns on pay for placement search engines  we generate revenue from fees paid by client advertisers based on a cpc for submitting their web sites listings into search engine databases and managing their bidding for keywords related to their web site listings 
prior to our acquisition of decide  we charged client advertisers an agreed cpc when search engine users clicked on their web site listing and we retained the spread between that agreed cpc and the cpc bid we placed on search engines 
following our acquisition of decide  we generally agree on a range of cpc bids for keywords we manage for clients 
paid inclusion 
for client advertisers running campaigns on algorithmic search engines  we generate revenue from fees paid by client advertisers based on cpc for submitting their web sites listings into search engine databases 
our client advertisers pay us an agreed cpc when search engine users click on their web site listings 
we pay search engines a share of our advertising revenue when their users click on our client advertisers web site listings 
the revenue share we pay search engines for paid inclusion is generally 
managed account services 
for managed account services  we generate revenue from fees paid by client advertisers to manage the complete search marketing process for them across all search engines 
our managed account services include initial site audits  planning search media campaigns  buying search media  building search engine submissions  managing pay per click and paid inclusion campaigns  reporting on campaign results  and optimizing campaign performance and search engine submissions 
we typically charge client advertisers a fee based  among other things  on their total committed budget for our managed account services and our achievement of specific performance target  among other factors 
optimization services 
for advertisers 
we generate revenue from fees paid by client advertisers for building and optimizing their web site listings submissions and reporting campaign results 
we provide optimization services for client advertisers that desire to maintain direct relationships with search engines 
these client advertisers buy search media directly  although we maybe involved in their media planning 
we typically charge advertisers a fee for optimization services determined by multiplying an agreed cpc by the number of clicks on web site listings we submit to search engines 
we may also charge fixed fees for reporting 
for search engines 
we generate revenue from fees paid by search engines for building and optimizing submissions to their databases by their advertisers 
this service is referred to in our industry as trusted feed generation 
we typically charge a fee based on a percentage of revenue generated by the search engine from advertisers that have web site listing submissions built and optimized by us 
we also may receive additional amounts related to the volume of services we perform for the search engine 
consulting services 
for consulting services  we generate a revenue from fixed fees charged for search engine optimization services and site audits 
we optimize key attributes of client advertiser web sites to ensure the greatest opportunity for proper indexing  listing and inclusion in the editorial results of algorithmic search engines 
we do not submit web site listings for advertisers as part of our consulting services 
site audits are reviews of client advertiser web sites to determine how best to plan  build and manage search campaigns 
our growth rate depends substantially on our ability to increase the number of clicks on web listings optimized and submitted by us for our client advertisers 
in addition  we must maintain the relationships we have with search engines 
if we do not renew our agreements with search engine distribution partners or build new relationships when distribution agreements are terminated  or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our growth rate also depends in part on our ability to increase the number and volume of transactions with client advertisers 
we believe this depends in part on managing accounts and search campaigns that result in purchases or conversions for our client advertisers 
technology solutions technology our open adsystem technology includes software licensed to customers and hosted locally on the customers servers 
we also provide an array of services to our customers 
we generate revenue from our technology segment in the following ways open adstream central service 
we generate revenue from our open adstream central service from fees paid by web publishers for administering open adstream on our servers 
we typically charge web publishers a fee based on a cpm related to advertising impressions 
our revenue is determined by multiplying the cpm by the number of impressions delivered and is typically billed on a monthly basis 
open adstream local software 
we generate revenue from licensing our open adstream local advertisement delivery and management software to web publishers 
our license agreements typically provide for a license fee and software maintenance and technical support services fee 
we negotiate license fees based on  among other things  the forecasted number of advertising impressions a web publisher will deliver using our software 
open advertiser service 
we generate revenue from our open advertiser advertisement delivery and management service from fees paid by advertisers and agencies for administering open advertiser on our servers 
we typically charge customers a fee based on a cpm related to advertising impressions

we generate revenue from insight act on the same basis as the associated open adstream and insight xe arrangement 
as of december   we have not generated significant revenue from insight act 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenue by providing professional services charged at an hourly rate and from fees paid by web publishers for trafficking their advertisements 
trafficking advertisements refers to entering advertisement creative material and campaign specifications into our open adstream software 
through our acquisition of decide  we provide paid search engine marketing services and technology using the decide dna technology 
using our decide dna service  an advertiser can manage bidding on keywords and phrases simultaneously across several search engines  setting cost per acquisition targets to achieve a desired return for their advertising spending 
as a result of our acquisition of decide  we have replaced our former insight se technology with decide dna 
we expect to begin third party licensing of decide dna in critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition  cost of revenues media our media revenues are generated from fees paid by client advertisers for advertising impressions 
e mail related revenue is derived from delivering advertisements to e mail lists 
we typically offer advertisers a pricing model based on cpm  which enables client advertisers to pay a fee based on the number of times its advertisement is viewed 
agreements are primarily short term and revenues are recognized as services are delivered provided that no significant obligations remain outstanding and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we become obligated to make royalty payments to web sites and e mail lists that have contracted with us  in the period the advertising impressions or e mails are delivered 
such expenses are classified as cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
search we generate revenue from our search segment primarily from fees paid by client advertisers when users click through to their web sites as a result of our submission of their web site listings into search engines databases 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from fees paid by search engines that employ us to optimize the submission of web site listings and report on advertising campaigns for their advertisers

 revenue recognition  upon delivery of the software  which is generally when the software is made available for download  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fees to all elements of the arrangement 
contracts that bundle the software license with software maintenance and technical support are recognized ratably over the contract term 
revenue from advertisement serving is recognized upon delivery 
revenue from software maintenance and technical support contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement  which typically does not exceed one year 
expenses related to our technology revenues are primarily payroll costs incurred to deliver and support the software  hosting  bandwidth and license fees paid to third party software vendors 
these expenses are classified as cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred revenue revenues that are billed or collected in advance of services being completed are deferred until the conclusion of the period of the service for which the advance billing or collection relates 
deferred revenues are included on the consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the service is performed and then recognized in the period in which the service is completed 
our deferred revenues primarily consist of billings in advance for software license subscriptions and software maintenance and technical support services 
allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowance we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables and a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers

valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets 
goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
business combinations our acquisitions are accounted for as purchase business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of tangible and intangible assets  and record as goodwill  the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
intangible assets include trademarks  customer relationships  acquired technology and covenants not to compete 
such intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are generally four to seven years 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
restructuring activities restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring related liabilities include estimates for  among other things  involuntary terminations of employees and disposition of lease obligations 
key variables in determining such estimates include timing of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs  and estimates for brokerage and other related costs 
the company periodically evaluates and  if necessary  adjusts the estimates based on currently available information 
short term investments sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for non current marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments

restructuring costs 
during and  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
our restructuring initiatives were to reduce employee headcount  consolidate operations and reduce office space in order to better align our sales  development and administrative organization and to position us for profitable growth consistent with our long term objectives

the restructuring involved the involuntary termination of approximately employees  the exiting of four offices  and a reduction of space at two offices in the fourth quarter of the million charge consisted of severance of million  office closing costs of million  disposal of fixed assets of million  and other exit costs of million 
impairment of intangibles assets 
we perform on going business reviews and  based on quantitative and qualitative measures  assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators are present 
where impairment indicators were identified  management determined the amount of the impairment charge by comparing the carrying values of goodwill and other long lived assets to their fair values 
in the fourth quarter of we made the strategic decision to no longer support the messenger product that was acquired with now marketing 
the related acquired technology was amortized until december  the remaining balance of million was considered impaired

the series a and series b preferred stock issued during the third quarter of  and the series c preferred stock issued in the second quarter of  accrue and cumulate dividends at a rate of per year  compounded monthly  payable when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
preferred stock conversion discount 
the preferred stock conversion discounts are the result of the change in the market value of the common stock on the date of issuance and the date the conversion price was established 
when we agreed to the initial terms of the transactions with the third parties  the conversion price of the preferred stock approximated the fair value of our underlying common stock 
from the time the agreements were substantially complete until the transactions closed and all contingencies were resolved eg stockholder approval  our common stock price increased substantially and as a result  the preferred stock was issued at a substantial discount to fair market value 
in accordance with gaap  the beneficial conversion feature  calculated as the difference between market value on the date of issuance and the conversion price  is required to be expensed immediately  however  the discount was limited to the amount of cash allocable to each of the preferred stock transactions 
as a result of the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the common stock into which the preferred stock were convertible as of the date of issuance  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million related to the series c preferred stock and million related to the series a and b preferred stock in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands december  net cash used in operating activities    net cash used in provided by investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities    since inception  we have financed our operations through equity financings and long term debt 
we used approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively  generally as a result of our net operating loss  adjusted for non cash items included in our net operating results as well as changes in various components of working capital  particularly the growth in accounts receivable 
we generally pay our search engine distribution partners and some of our web sites in advance of receiving payments from our customers 
in addition  the average number of days to collect from our customer have increased due to a greater portion of business with advertising agencies and expansion into geographical regions which historically have a slower payment rate 
these factors  combined with our growth rate and acquisitions  have led to an increase in accounts receivable and cash usage in operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in those activities related million to the acquisition of rmk  million to the acquisition of decide  million to short term investments  and million to capital expenditures 
investing activities used million in  related to purchases of computer equipment for general operational purposes  cash used in the acquisition of insight first and investing in ipromotions

financing activities provided million in primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  the issuance of subordinated convertible debentures and the exercise of stock options offset by the settlement of notes to publigroupe for million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock 
financing activities provided million in primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  issuance of notes payable and the exercise of stock options 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded because we incurred net operating losses for all periods presented 
at december   we had approximately million of us net operating loss carryforwards 
our net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years through as a result of various equity transactions during    and  we believe that we have undergone an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  utilization of a substantial part of the net operating loss carryforward is limited 
due to our history of operating losses and the section limitation  there is substantial uncertainty surrounding whether we will ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  these assets have been fully reserved 
during and  the valuation allowance decreased by million and million  respectively 
of the total valuation allowance of million  tax benefits recognized in the future of approximately of million will be applied directly to additional paid in capital 
this amount relates to the tax effect of employee stock option deductions included in our net operating loss carryforward 
we continue to increase capital expenditures and operating lease commitments  which is consistent with our increased staffing and operational expansion  and we anticipate this will continue in the future as business conditions merit 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
management believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements

semi annual interest payments at began in january both the principal and interest may be paid in common stock 
capital and operating leases 
capital leases relate to various office equipment 
the operating lease agreements relate primarily to our offices throughout the united states and internationally with original lease periods expiring between and we have entered into various sublease arrangements associated with our excess facilities 
such subleases have terms extending through as of december   we have recorded restructuring reserves totaling approximately million relating to excess space at some of the facilities  net of amounts estimated to be received from our sublease arrangements 
net lease commitments as of december  can be summarized as follows in millions capital leases operating leases subleases in thousands year ending december  thereafter  total minimum lease payments   less amount representing interest present value of minimum lease payments less current portion long term portion dividends on preferred stock 
our preferred stock accrue and cumulate dividends at a rate of per year  compounded monthly  payable when  as and if declared by our board of directors

accrued but unpaid dividends are cancelled upon conversion of the preferred stock 
as of december   there are approximately  of accrued but unpaid dividends 
after giving effect to conversions in   shares of preferred stock were outstanding at december  employment arrangements 
we have various employment agreements with employees  the majority of which are for one year with an automatic renewal 
the potential obligation under these contracts is approximately million for including salary and performance based target bonuses 
we pay bonuses to executive employees based on the achievement of revenue goals and other financial measures including earnings before interest  taxes  amortization and stock based compensation 
these contracts also require severance payments in the event of involuntary termination which generally range in amount from three months to one year s salary 
all non us employees have employment contracts as required by local law 
the majority of these contracts allow for resignation or termination by either party at any time  according to the notice period provisions contained in the employment contracts  or according to the minimum notice period as mandated by local law 
the contracts or  if no expressed provision is included in the contract  local law also require severance for involuntary terminations ranging from one to six months 
as of january   there were approximately employees in europe whose annualized base salaries are approximately million 
restructuring expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million remaining of cash outlay obligations relating to restructuring and exit costs consisting of severance and rent 
insurance coverage 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors  and officers and former directors  officers and employees of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
the indemnification provided by us to our officers and directors does not have a stipulated maximum  therefore we are not able to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum liabilities 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
indemnifications 
in connection with our commercial agreements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
impact of recently issued accounting standards stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company obtains employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using accounting principles board opinion apb no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
sfas r will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  july  for the company and applies to all awards granted or modified after the effective date 
in addition  compensation cost for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on the effective date shall be recognized on or after the effective date  as the related services are rendered  based on the awards grant date fair value as previously calculated for the pro forma disclosure under sfas we expect that upon the adoption of sfas r we will apply the modified prospective application transition method  as permitted by the statement 
under such transition method  upon the adoption of sfas r  our financial statements for periods prior to the effective date of the statement will not be restated 
the impact of this statement on our financial statements or our results of operations in and beyond will depend upon various factors  among them  our future compensation strategy 
we expect the effect of applying sfas r on our results of operation in as it relates to existing option plans would not be materially different from the sfas pro forma effect previously reported 
impairment of debt and equity instruments in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf issue no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted by the company in these financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we will evaluate the effect  if any  of eitf issue no 
when final guidance is released 
risk factors risks related to real media  inc 
we have a history of losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have not achieved profitability in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in any reporting period  except as result of non recurring gains  during our history  and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we may incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis in the future 
evaluating our business may be difficult due to our acquitisions and dispositions 
we have acquired and disposed of a substantial number of businesses during our operating history and thus our business model has continuously evolved and changed 
when evaluating our current business model  you must consider the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by companies with such history  particularly companies in new and rapidly expanding markets such as internet advertising 
these risks include our ability to develop new relationships and maintain existing relationships with our web sites  advertisers  search engine providers and other third parties  continue to develop and upgrade our technology  respond to competitive developments  implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  adapt to industry consolidation  and attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
our numerous acquisitions and dispositions  and operating history generally  makes it difficult to predict future revenues and operating expenses 
we have substantial debt  and we may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and repayment obligations 
in september  we issued to a single holder a subordinated convertible debenture in the principal amount of million that matures in september the amount of our debt could have important consequences  including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any operating cash flow that we generate to paying principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for operations  limiting our ability to grow and make capital expenditures due to the covenants contained in our debt arrangements  impairing our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  invest in new or developing technologies  or take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and making us more vulnerable if there is an economic downturn or if our business experiences difficulties 
if we cannot generate sufficient additional cash flow  we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations  repay our debt when due  or comply with other covenants in the subordinated convertible debentures 
if we breach the debentures  the investor could require repayment of all amounts owed  and we may not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts 
we may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repay or refinance our indebtedness 
the issuance of stock upon redemption of our subordinated convertible debentures may substantially dilute the interests of other security holders 
stockholders could experience substantial dilution resulting from our election to pay the semi annual accrued interest due in common stock or repay the principal amount in common stock 
we are obligated to make semi annual interest payments on january and july of each year and the entire principal face amount of the debentures is due and payable on september  we may elect to pay interest in cash  in shares of our common stock or in additional debentures 
in addition  if  at any time after september   the price of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price per share of our common stock of the debentures for a period of five consecutive trading days we may be required to immediately repurchase million in principal amount of the debentures 
we may elect to repay the principal amount of the debentures in cash or in shares of our common stock 
if we so elect  payment in shares shall be based upon ninety percent of the average of the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the principal market as reported by bloomberg financial lp during the five trading days immediately prior to the interest payment date  in the case of an interest payment  or during the trading days immediately prior to the maturity date  in the case of the repayment of the principal amount of the debentures 
if we decide to repay the principal in cash we will need additional capital to fund this obligation 
our ability to arrange financing and the cost of this financing will depend upon many factors  including general economic and capital market conditions generally  and in particular the non investment grade debt market  credit availability from banks or other lenders  investor confidence in our industry generally and our company specifically  and provisions of tax and securities law that are conducive to raising capital 
if we need additional funds and are unable to raise them  our inability to raise them will have an adverse effect on our operations 
if we decide to raise additional funds by incurring debt  we may become subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants and ratios 
if we fail to make the mandatory redemptions in cash and if our stock price significantly declines  we could potentially be obligated to issue a larger number of shares of our common stock in redemption of the debentures 
we may need to raise additional funds to continue operations 
an unforeseen reduction in our revenues  an unexpected impairment of our receivables  or an unbudgeted increase in expenses or capital expenditures may require us to raise additional funds to continue operations 
to the extent we encounter additional opportunities to raise cash  we may sell additional equity or debt securities  which would result in further dilution of our stockholders 
stockholders may experience extreme dilution due to our current stock price and the amount of financing we may need to raise and these securities may have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock 
our subordinated convertible debentures limit our ability to incur additional debt  and any future indebtedness that we may incur could contain covenants that restrict our operating flexibility 
we have limited access to the capital markets to raise capital 
the capital markets have been unpredictable in the past  especially for unprofitable companies such as ours 
in addition  it is difficult to raise capital under current market conditions 
the amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control  such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume 
as a result  efforts to secure financing on terms attractive to us may not be successful  and we may not be able to secure additional financing on any terms 
due to our operating losses  it may be difficult to obtain debt financing 
if we are able to consummate a financing arrangement  the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet our future needs 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  our business  results of operation  financial condition and continued viability will be materially and adversely affected 
our acquisitions  which have been critical to our growth  may not be successful 
we were formed in february to consolidate three internet advertising companies and have since acquired many other companies 
we may continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
if we acquire additional companies  we will continue to face risks of integrating and improving our financial and management controls  advertisement serving technology  reporting systems and procedures  and expanding  training and managing our work force 
this process of integration may take a significant period of time and will require the dedication of management and other resources  which may distract management s attention from our other operations 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing for future acquisitions  and the potential loss of key senior managers or employees of any acquired business 
our inability to successfully integrate any acquired company  or failure to achieve any expected synergies  could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to successfully integrate real media korea co  ltd 
and decide holding pty limited into our company 
in january  we completed our acquisition of rmk 
in august  we completed the acquisition of decide 
we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals of the acquisitions  and the acquisitions may not be successful 
the success of the acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to expand the business of rmk and decide into new geographical markets and our ability to retain key senior managers  employees and customers of these companies 
we may have difficulty integrating the business and operations or retaining their key personnel as well as implementing and maintaining standards  controls  procedures and policies that are consistent with ours 
our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast and results in prior periods may not be indicative of future results 
at times in the past and in certain segments  our revenues have grown significantly and also have decreased during certain periods and in certain segments 
accurate predictions of future revenues are difficult because of the rapid changes in our markets and our possible need to sell assets to fund operations 
we have also acquired or disposed of various subsidiaries and product lines over the last several years 
accordingly  investors should not rely on past revenue growth rates as an indicator of future revenue growth 
our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the addition of new or loss of existing clients  changes in fees paid by advertisers or other clients  changes in royalties payable by us to owners of web sites  the demand by advertisers and web publishers for our advertising solutions  the introduction of new internet marketing services by us or our competitors  variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other costs relating to the maintenance or expansion of our operations  including personnel costs  changes in governmental regulation of the internet  and general economic conditions 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast due to the above factors 
in addition  our expense levels are based in large part on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues 
any increased expenses may precede or may not be followed by increased revenues  as we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully execute our business model 
our business model is to generate revenue by providing interactive marketing solutions to advertisers  advertising agencies and web publishers 
the profit potential for key components of this business model is unproven 
to be successful  both internet advertising and our solutions will need to achieve broad market acceptance by advertisers  advertising agencies and web publishers 
our ability to generate significant revenue from advertisers will depend  in part  on our ability to contract with web publishers that have web sites with adequate available advertisement space inventory 
further  these web sites must generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to our advertisers 
the intense competition among internet advertising sellers has led to the creation of a number of pricing alternatives for internet advertising 
these alternatives make it difficult for us to project future levels of advertising revenue and applicable gross margin that can be sustained by us or the internet advertising industry in general 
intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of  and to generate demand for  our products and services  including our newer products and services such as insight act  decide dna software and ontarget behavioral targeting 
enterprises may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing direct marketing systems 
in addition  since online direct marketing is emerging as a new and distinct business apart from online advertising  potential adopters of online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored to their specific requirements 
we may be unable to meet the demands of these clients 
acceptance of our new solutions will depend on the continued emergence of internet commerce  communication and advertising 
demand for our new solutions may not emerge or become sustainable 
our technology solutions may not function as designed and may cause business disruption 
open adsystem is our proprietary advertisement serving technology that serves as our sole advertisement serving solution 
we have developed a variety of products to work on or with this platform 
some of these products  such as insight act are not yet widely available or are only available in beta version to some or all of our customers 
we must  among other things  ensure that the technology will function efficiently at high volumes  interact properly with our database  offer the functionality demanded by our customers and assimilate our sales and reporting functions 
we must further complete development of our beta products 
this development effort could fail technologically or could take more time than expected 
customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them  including failures affecting our ability to deliver advertisements or report on advertisement delivery without significant delay 
sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers  advertising agencies and web publishers and result in contract terminations  fee rebates and make goods  thereby reducing our revenue 
our media solutions business utilizes our open adsystem technology  and thus any performance issues with open adsystem will also impact media solutions 
slower response time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our deployed software or hardware due to an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers 
to the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our revenue could decline if we fail to effectively manage advertising inventory made available to us and our growth could be impeded if we fail to acquire access to new advertising inventory 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively manage advertising inventory made available to us 
the web publishers that list their unsold advertising inventory with us are not bound by long term contracts 
in addition  web publishers can change the amount of inventory they make available to us at any time 
if a web publisher decides not to make advertising space from its web sites available to us  we may not be able to replace this advertising space with advertising space from other web sites that have comparable traffic patterns and user demographics quickly enough to fulfill our advertisers requests 
this would result in lost revenue 
we expect that our customers requirements will become more sophisticated as the web matures as an advertising medium 
if we fail to manage our existing advertising space effectively to meet our customers changing requirements  our revenue could decline 
our growth also depends on our ability to expand our advertising inventory 
to attract new advertisers  we must maintain a consistent supply of attractive advertising space 
we intend to expand our advertising inventory by selectively adding to our network new web publishers that offer attractive demographics  innovative and quality content and large audiences 
our ability to attract new web publishers to our network and to retain web publishers currently in our network will depend on various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include our ability to introduce new and innovative product lines and services  our ability to efficiently manage our existing advertising inventory  our pricing policies and the cost efficiency to web publishers of outsourcing all or part of their advertising sales 
in addition  the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from web publishers continues to increase 
the size of our inventory may not increase or even remain constant in the future 
we could lose customers or advertising inventory if we fail to measure impressions  clicks and actions on advertisements in a manner that is acceptable to our advertisers and web publishers 
we earn advertising revenue and make payments to web publishers based on the number of impressions  clicks and actions from advertisements delivered on our network 
advertisers and web publishers willingness to use our services and join our network will depend on the extent to which they perceive our measurements of clicks to be accurate and reliable 
advertisers and web publishers often maintain their own technologies and methodologies for counting clicks  and from time to time we have had to resolve differences between our measurements and theirs 
any significant dispute over the proper measurement of clicks or other user responses to advertisements could cause us to lose customers or advertising inventory 
we disclose pro forma information  which may exclude items that are important to an investor s understanding of our results of operations 
we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma and other non gaap information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes or may exclude certain special charges and other costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases  and to compare the gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  the availability of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods  which could substantially limit the eventual utilization of these carryforwards 
we could be adversely affected by an impairment of a significant amount of goodwill and or intangible assets on our balance sheet 
in the course of our operating history  we have acquired and disposed of numerous assets and businesses 
some of our acquisitions have resulted in the recording of a significant amount of goodwill and or intangible assets on our financial statements 
the goodwill and or intangible assets were recorded because the fair value of the net assets acquired was less than the purchase price 
we may not realize the full value of the goodwill and or intangible assets 
as such  we evaluate on at least an annual basis whether events and circumstances indicate that all or some of the carrying value of goodwill and or intangible assets are no longer recoverable  in which case we would write off the unrecoverable portion as a charge to our earnings 
to improve our operating performance  we may determine to acquire other assets or businesses complementary to our business and  as a result  we may record additional goodwill and or intangible assets in the future 
the possible write off of the goodwill and or intangible assets could negatively impact our future earnings 
we will also be required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of any acquisition to the value of any intangible assets that meet the criteria specified in the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  such as marketing  customer or contract based intangibles 
the amount allocated to these intangible assets could be amortized over a fairly short period 
as a result  our earnings and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
the success of our search operations depends on a small number of search engine distribution partners  and the loss of one of them could result in a substantial decrease in our search revenue 
we have generated the majority of our global search revenue from clicks originating on google and overture  which is a subsidiary of yahoo  through relationships in many countries in which we operate 
we expect that these search engines will continue to generate a majority or more of our search revenue for the foreseeable future 
the interruption or loss of our relationship with google or overture would cause a significant decrease in search revenue 
as a result of consolidation among search engines  and other search marketing companies  we could lose one of more of our clients or face increased competition from clients that internally develop or acquire capabilities similar to our service 
in addition  as our search engine clients operations continue to evolve  we may be required to adjust our business strategy to maintain relationships with our clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our search revenue 
our customers and partners may experience adverse business conditions that could adversely affect our business 
as a result of unfavorable conditions in the capital markets  some of our customers may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to support their long term operations 
as a result  these customers have reduced their spending on internet advertising  which has materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have entered into a strategic business relationship with lycos  and may enter into similar relationships with other companies 
these companies may experience similar adverse business conditions that may render them unable to meet our expectations for the strategic business relationship or to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
such an event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations by season and due to general economic conditions 
we believe that our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations because advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
furthermore  internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months  which reduces the number of advertisements to sell and deliver 
expenditures by advertisers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
our revenue could be materially reduced by a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general  which could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or budget cycles or extend our sales cycle 
due to such risks  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results 
if we lose our ceo or other senior managers  our business will be adversely affected 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our senior management and key sales and technical personnel  particularly our chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could materially and adversely affect our ability to develop our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
we may be unable to retain our key personnel or attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have experienced in the past  and may continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  especially in sales and marketing positions 
some of our software is licensed from third parties which could become unavailable to us 
some of our products  including one or more modules for our open adsystem platform  contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future or on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays  delays in the development of future products or enhancements of existing products  or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events  including terrorist attacks  because we have limited backup systems 
we have limited backup systems and have experienced system failures and electrical outages from time to time in the past  which have disrupted our operations 
we have a limited disaster recovery plan in the event of damage from fire  floods  typhoons  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against these unexpected adverse events 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may experience a complete system shutdown 
any business interruption insurance that we carry is unlikely to be sufficient to compensate us for loss of business in the event of a significant catastrophe 
in addition  interruptions in our services could result from the failure of our telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame we require 
our open adsystem technology resides on computer systems located in our data centers housed by savvis in the united states and level communications in europe 
these systems continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success  as a substantial portion of the revenue depend on the continuing availability of these systems 
despite precautions that we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions in the delivery of our solutions 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations 
to improve the performance and to prevent disruption of our services  we may have to make substantial investments to deploy additional servers or one or more copies of our web sites to mirror our online resources 
although we believe we carry property insurance with adequate coverage limits  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses  particularly with respect to loss of business and reputation  that may occur 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage to our employees  facilities  clients  our clients customers and vendors  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial position 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
we depend on proprietary rights  and we face the risk of infringement 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have received two patents in the united states  and have filed and intend to file additional patent applications in the united states 
in addition  we apply to register our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
our patent applications and trademark applications may not be approved 
even if they are approved  such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks  our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties that may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in many foreign countries in which we operate  where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we have from time to time licensed  and we may license in the future  elements of our trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these business partners  such partners may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
the value of our proprietary rights could decline in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
we have  from time to time  been  and may in the future be  subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or the web publishers with web sites in the network  or by customers who employ our technology solutions  whom we may be required  or may elect  to indemnify against such claims 
such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation  which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
from time to time  we may selectively pursue claims of infringement of our patents and other intellectual property rights by third parties 
such claims and any resultant litigation present the risk that a court could determine  either preliminarily or finally  that some of our patents or other intellectual property rights are not valid  which may make it difficult to sell our technology solutions and may lead to a loss of and an inability to generate licensing revenue from our patents 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to pursue  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to intellectual property liability 
we may be liable for content available or posted on the web sites of our publishers 
we may be liable to third parties for content in the advertising we serve if the music  artwork  text or other content involved violates the copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights of such third parties or if the content is defamatory 
any claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or divert management s attention 
our international operations face legal and cultural challenges 
we have operations in a number of international markets  including asia  canada and europe 
to date  we have limited experience in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
international operations are subject to other risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  general import export restrictions relating to encryption technology and or privacy  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world 
we may be unable to successfullly promote and maintain the quality of our brands 
we believe that establishing and maintaining the brand identities of our products and services is a critical aspect of attracting and expanding a large client base 
promotion and enhancement of our brands will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide high quality service 
if businesses do not perceive our existing services to be of high quality  or if we introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by businesses  we will risk diluting our brand identities and decreasing their attractiveness to existing and potential customers 
in order to attract and retain customers and to promote and maintain brands in response to competitive pressures  we may also have to increase substantially our financial commitment to creating and maintaining a distinct brand loyalty among our customers 
if we incur significant expenses in an attempt to improve our services or to promote and maintain our brands  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  any brand identities we establish may be diluted as a result of any inability to protect our trademarks and service marks or domain names  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the market for our common stock 
we have a very substantial overhang of common stock and future sales of our common stock will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
as of february   there were approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding 
as of that date  we also had an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock that may be sold into the market in the future  including approximately million shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of options  million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock and exercise of the related warrants  million shares of our common stock upon vesting of restricted shares issued  and million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and exercise of the related warrants 
in addition  if we undertake an additional acquisitions or financing involving securities convertible into shares of our common stock  the aggregate number of shares into which those securities are convertible will further increase our overhang 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock into the market  or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or conversion of shares of preferred stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
our share price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to be volatile 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past 
we may also become involved in this type of litigation 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the power of our board of directors to designate and issue shares of stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock  which may be issued by our board of directors for such consideration as they may consider sufficient without seeking stockholder approval 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  the rights and preferences of which may be designated by our board of directors 
these designations may be made without stockholder approval 
the designation and issuance of preferred stock in the future could create additional securities that would have dividend and liquidation preferences prior in right to the outstanding shares of common stock 
these provisions could also impede a change in control 
sunra capital holdings ltd 
and publigroupe usa holding  inc 
collectively control a substantial portion of our total outstanding voting power and may be able to influence certain approval matters and prevent a change of control 
sunra capital holdings ltd 
and affiliated parties are currently the beneficial owners of approximately of our common stock 
publigroupe usa holdings owns approximately of our common stock  and has agreed to vote on all corporate matters in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors 
based on their voting power  combined with that of management and others affiliated or associated with the company  sunra and publigroupe may be able to influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  amendment of our charter and approval of significant corporate transactions 
we also believe that one or more unaffiliated groups have purchased significant quantities of our common stock 
effects of anti takeover provisions could inhibit the acquisition of our company 
some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control  impede the ability of our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay future cash dividends 
we currently do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the near future 
we may never pay cash dividends or distributions on our common stock 
in addition  our subordinated convertible debentures restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  contractual restrictions and any other factors that the board of directors decides is relevant 
risks related to our industry 
our business may not grow if the internet advertising market does not continue to develop 
the internet as a marketing medium has not been in existence for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate its effectiveness 
our business would be adversely affected if the internet advertising market fails to develop in the near future 
there are currently no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising other than click through rates  which generally have been declining 
such standards may not develop to sufficiently support the internet as a significant advertising medium 
actual or perceived ineffectiveness of online advertising in general  or inaccurate measurements or database information in particular  could limit the long term growth of online advertising and cause our revenue levels to decline 
our failure to compete successfully may hinder our growth 
the markets for internet advertising and related products and services are intensely competitive and such competition is expected to increase 
our failure to compete successfully may hinder our growth 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control  including the development of new online advertising media and methods  the timing and market acceptance of new products and enhancements of existing services developed by us and our competitors  changing demands regarding customer service and support  shifts in sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors  and the ease of use  performance  price and reliability of our services and products 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  the internet must compete for a share of advertisers total budgets with traditional advertising media  such as television  radio  cable and print  as well as content aggregation companies and other companies that facilitate internet advertising 
to the extent that the internet is perceived to be a limited or ineffective advertising medium  advertisers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising  which could limit the growth of internet advertising 
changes in government regulation could decrease our revenues and increase our costs 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the united states congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
state governments or governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
in addition  the growth and development of internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
changes in laws and standards relating to data collection and use practices and the privacy of internet users and other individuals could harm our business 
the us federal and various state governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
in and  the us congress proposed several new pieces of legislation that would limit the use of technologies  including cookies  web beacons and javascript  required by our products and services 
the effectiveness of our open adsystem products and services could be significantly limited by federal and state regulations limiting the collection or use of information regarding internet users 
since many of the proposed federal and state laws or regulations are being developed  we cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have on its business 
in addition  growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of personal information has led to self regulation of these practices by the internet advertising and direct marketing industry and to increased federal and state regulation 
the network advertising initiative  of which we are a member  has developed self regulatory principles for online preference marketing 
we are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection  distribution and use of personal information 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws that limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information 
while we monitor legislative initiatives  in the event that more onerous federal or state laws or regulations are enacted or applied to us or our clients  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
privacy concerns may prevent us from collecting user data 
growing concerns about the use of cookies and data collection may limit our ability to develop user profiles 
web sites typically place small files of information  commonly known as cookies  on a user s hard drive  generally without the user s knowledge or consent 
cookie information is passed to the web site through the internet user s browser software 
our open adsystem technology targets advertising to users through the use of cookies and other non personally identifying information 
open adsystem enables the use of cookies to deliver targeted advertising and to limit the frequency with which an advertisement is shown to a user 
most currently available internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive  and a small minority of users are currently choosing to do so 
users can also delete cookies from their hard drive or modify them at any time 
some internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies 
any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and impair our targeting capabilities 
microsoft corporation has changed the design and instrumentation of its web browser in such a way as to give users the option to accept or reject third party cookies 
giving users the option to decline such cookies could result in a reduction of the number of internet users that we can profile anonymously 
such changes also could adversely affect our ability to determine the reach of advertising campaigns sold and delivered by us and the frequency with which users of sites in the network see the same advertisement 
if the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited  we would likely have to switch to other technology that would allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information 
while such technology currently exists  it is substantially less effective than cookies 
replacement of cookies could require significant engineering time and resources  might not be completed in time to avoid negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations  and might not be commercially feasible 
we face risks associated with technological change 
the internet and internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions and changing customer demands 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
in addition  the development of commercial software and technology that blocks  eliminates or otherwise screens out internet advertising may reduce the value of advertising inventory on our web alliance and the benefits of our technology solutions to our customers 
we cannot guarantee that a new commercial software or technology  for end users or enterprises  will not be capable of eliminating a portion or all of the advertisement formats  including banners  pop ups  pop unders and other formats  that we utilize through our web alliance or that we currently deliver through our technology solutions 
to the extent that our customers refuse to pay for advertisements that are blocked  or if the use of blocking software exceeds our expectations  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our network operations may be vulnerable to hacking  viruses and other disruptions  which may make our products and services less attractive and reliable 
internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurs 
hacking involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data  software  hardware or other computer equipment 
hackers  if successful  could misappropriate proprietary information or cause disruptions in our service 
we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect our web site against hackers 
any measures we may take may not be effective 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability  as well as materially damage our reputation and decrease our user traffic 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
cash and cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of the investments as recorded by real media 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  in thousands thereafter total cash and cash equivalents   average interest rate loan payable    average interest rate the subordinated convertible debentures due contains a provision that gives the holder the ability to call a portion of the note upon the satisfaction of a trading price condition 
this condition constitutes an embedded derivative 
the value of the derivative is reviewed on a quarterly basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the value of the embedded derivative at december  is immaterial to our financial position and we did not hold any other derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk we transact business in a variety of foreign countries and are thus subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for  and were not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies
