item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview the company operates primarily in two industry segments  the heating and air conditioning segment and the construction materials segment 
the primary products manufactured by the heating and air conditioning segment are gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters  evaporative coolers and fan coils 
gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coil products are manufactured at williams furnace co  headquartered in colton  california 
evaporative coolers are manufactured at phoenix manufacturing  inc  headquartered in phoenix  arizona 
the primary products of the construction materials segment are ready mix concrete  construction aggregates  building supplies and doors which are offered by transit mix concrete co 
and castle concrete company in colorado springs  colorado and transit mix of pueblo  inc and mckinney door and hardware  inc 
mdhi in pueblo  colorado 
currently  rocky mountain ready mix concrete  inc rmrm of denver  colorado  only offers ready mix concrete 
heating and air conditioning segment furnace and console heater sales volume in was steady compared to the prior year s level  however  margins declined as a result of the increased steel prices 
fan coil sales increased as a result of a modest increase in industry wide demand 
margins were similarly affected by increased raw material prices and price competition 
evaporative cooler sales volume declined primarily due to the loss of a portion of the evaporative cooler business at a national home center account 
as with the furnace product line  margins declined as steel prices increased 
selling  general and administrative expenses were lower due to a reduction in office personnel and reduced legal costs 
sales commissions were lower as a result of the decline in evaporative cooler sales 
this segment s pre tax earnings exceeded its cash flow by approximately  a decrease in payables and accrued expenses accounted for most of the reduced cash flow 
capital expenditures modestly exceeded depreciation 
capital expenditures included the replacement of certain equipment at pmi to improve safety and the purchase of a finishing system at wfc for certain wall furnace components 
construction materials segment despite their proximity  denver  colorado springs and pueblo have distinct competitive and economic conditions 
concrete sales volumes improved in all three markets compared to last year reflecting a modest improvement in construction activity along the front range in colorado 
the price of concrete  however  illustrated the diversity of the three markets 
while increases in cement and fuel prices were able to be substantially recovered through increased selling prices in the pueblo and colorado springs markets  average selling prices in denver actually declined reflecting the intensely competitive market 
the sales volume of construction aggregates decreased modestly from the level  however  gross profits rose as a result of improved operations at the two recently added aggregates plants  one at the colorado springs sand operation and the other at our pueblo gravel operation 
sales of doors and supplies increased over from the prior year 
while steel prices also affected these operations  gross profits improved because of well timed inventory purchases that enabled the division to satisfy customers demands for reinforced steel bar rebar when much of the competition could not acquire adequate supplies 
the construction materials segment typically requires large capital investments  particularly when volume is strong 
capital spending increased slightly during to  mirroring the modest increase in demand for concrete 
a new batch plant in pueblo west was added as well as a truck tracking system 
other expenditures were primarily routine replacements and upgrades 
cash flow from this segment was less than pre tax earnings by approximately  an increase in receivables  reflecting the improved sales volume  temporarily reduced cash flow 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were  at the end of compared to  at the prior year end 
operations in provided  of cash compared to  in and  generated in the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was largely due to a lower level of earnings before non cash charges and gains on sale of property and equipment 
net working capital increased by  compared to an increase of  in the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the decreased earnings 
net working capital increased by  in compared to an increase of only  in net cash used in investing activities was  in   in and  in capital expenditures for  and were   and  respectively 
the capital expenditures in included a new batch plant in pueblo west and a truck tracking system 
the capital expenditures in included the construction of a maintenance facility in pueblo and completion of the brighton batch plant begun in the expenditures in included the completion of three large projects that were begun in a new state of the art sand processing plant was completed in colorado springs during the third quarter  a new aggregate processing plant in pueblo was completed in june and a new central mix batch plant was added in colorado springs 
in addition  a new batch plant was purchased to replace the existing facility in brighton  colorado 
as noted above  the new plant became operational in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were   and  during  and  respectively 
sales of two parcels of real estate generated  of the amount

budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  including  for the construction materials segment and  for the heating and air conditioning segment  which is approximately  less than planned depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the expenditures are primarily for routine replacement and upgrades 
the company expects that the expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow

capital resources  obligations and commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements revolving credit and term loan agreement the company signed a revolving credit and term loan agreement credit agreement with two banks in september the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of  and a term loan facility in the original amount of  both facilities are unsecured and bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
the term loan is payable in escalating quarterly installments with final payment of all then unpaid principal on june  at january    was outstanding on the term loan while there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is available for seasonal needs including the funding of seasonal sales programs related to the furnace and evaporative cooler product lines 
the line is also used for stand by letters of credit to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
currently  such performance based rate is libor plus for the term loan and libor plus for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
effective december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement in order to minimize the adverse impact of the floating interest rate characteristic of most of the company s term loan borrowings 
the company s current effective interest rate on the outstanding term loan is after giving effect to the swap agreement 
such rate is subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
the company concluded that it was appropriate to take advantage of the interest rate environment and fix the interest rate at a relatively low level for a five year period 
obligations and commitments the following tables represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as debt guarantees  as of january  payments due by period as of january  amounts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt including interest see note operating leases see note minimum royalty agreement see note total contractual obligations interest on long term debt is computed using the interest rate in effect at january  and gives effect to the swap agreement 
the interest amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facility because future borrowings under this facility are unknown at this time 
amounts of commitment expiration per period as of january  amounts in thousands other commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years standby letters of credit other than the anticipated funds to be provided to fund the tender offer discussed in note  we believe that existing cash balances and anticipated cash flow  supplemented by seasonal borrowings against the revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months

operations fiscal vs 
consolidated sales  at  in  were  or  higher than in the increase was realized by the construction materials segment where sales reached  above the amount 
concrete volumes grew in all locations as construction activity along the front range in colorado improved modestly 
prices improved in the colorado springs and pueblo markets in response to increased cement and fuel costs 
the denver market remained highly competitive resulting in lower ready mix concrete prices in spite of the higher cement and fuel costs 
sales of construction aggregates declined slightly 
sales in the supply and door divisions were strong and exceeded the level by over 
sales in the heating and air conditioning segment decreased  
the decline was primarily due to lower evaporative cooler sales as a result of losing the window unit business at a large national home center account 
furnace sales were approximately the same as the prior year 
fan coil sales improved in a still weak market 
the company experienced a high level of price competition in all of its product lines during  especially in the denver ready mix concrete market 
during  steel and fuel prices dramatically outpaced the general rate of inflation 
the company was able to recover a portion of the cost increases through higher selling prices 
the rate of increase in health care costs subsided in compared to the prior year 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the decline in the heating and air conditioning segment was primarily due to increased steel costs during the year  an increase in workers compensation claims and the write off of the remaining inventories associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant 
the decline in the construction materials segment was primarily in the denver market due to lower prices for ready mix concrete exacerbated by higher cement and fuel costs and an increase in workers compensation claims 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in despite the increase in sales 
the decrease occurred in the heating and air conditioning segment as a result of a reduction in office staff  and reduced legal expenses 
commissions declined reflecting the decrease in evaporative cooler sales 
the decrease in the heating and air conditioning segment was partially offset in the construction materials segment where selling and administrative expenses increased in response to the improved sales 
depreciation  depletion and amortization declined reflecting the effect of reduced capital spending in recent years 
the gain on disposition of property and equipment increased due to the sales of two parcels of real estate in colorado which generated gains of  in the decline in operating income from  to  is primarily due to the increased raw material costs and lower evaporative cooler sales in the air conditioning segment partially offset by the increased sales  lower depreciation expense and the gain on sale of property in the construction materials segment 
other income declined as a result of  of gain realized during on the settlement of property tax bills related to the oracle ridge mining partners property 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the effective rate in was reduced by due to earned colorado and california enterprise zone credits that resulted in either a refund of prior years taxes or that will benefit future tax years 
a deduction for percentage depletion  the donation of appreciated property and the release of tax contingencies also reduced the tax rate by  and  respectively 
see note operations fiscal vs 
consolidated sales in declined  or  to  sales declined  in the construction materials segment 
the reduced level of construction activity along the front range in colorado led to lower volumes and increased price competition resulting in lower ready mix concrete prices  most notably in the denver metropolitan area 
the reduced volume combined with the lower prices account for the diminished sales level 
sales in the heating and air conditioning segment decreased  
fan coil sales continue to reflect the nationwide slump in commercial construction  particularly hotel construction 
the sharp decline in fan coil sales was only partially offset by improved evaporative cooler sales 
the improved evaporative cooler sales were primarily driven by hot  dry weather that persisted later in the year than normal 
the company experienced a high level of price competition in all of its product lines during  especially in the denver ready mix concrete market 
during  inflation was not a significant factor at any of the operations except that employee health care costs and general business insurance premiums again dramatically outpaced the rate of inflation 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization  as a percent of sales  decreased from to 
the improvement realized in the heating and air conditioning segment was primarily due to a  write down in of inventories and other costs associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant 
a very slight improvement was experienced in the construction materials segment due to the inclusion of mdhi for the full year in the further decline in construction activity along the front range in colorado had the effect of increasing price competition resulting in lower prices for ready mix concrete 
the effect of lower concrete prices on profit margins was largely offset by lower costs and operating improvement at the various aggregates locations 
selling and administrative expenses increased in despite the decline in sales 
the increase was due to higher legal costs related to product liability claims and a dispute with a supplier concerning the continued availability of a key purchased component for our evaporative cooler product line 
gain on disposition of property and equipment increased in due to  realized from the sale of a not exploitable aggregate property in colorado 
the decline in operating income from  to  is primarily due to the decreased sales  the heightened competition in colorado and the aforementioned increased legal costs 
other income increased in as a result of  of gain realized on the settlement of property tax bills related to the oracle ridge mining partners property

see note critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost at january  at last in  first out  with the remainder at first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed annually for excess or obsolete stock with a provision recorded  where appropriate 
intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized as a charge to earnings 
we annually assess goodwill for potential impairment 
this assessment requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates  and growth rates 
no impairment was indicated in the current year 
if the assessment had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired  an impairment charge would have been recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  changes in different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimated fair value 
liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
provision for workers compensation and automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are recorded in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and are reviewed at least annually for revisions in estimates 
the company records a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon estimates of the recoverable quantities of rock and sand available in each location combined with an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim a property 
provision is made based upon the units of production method 
actual reclamation costs are charged against the reserve 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation are periodically updated by an independent professional 
in a similar manner  depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 
sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
the amount is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience 
recently issued accounting standards and tax law changes the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued the following statements and interpretations in november  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  was issued which amends the guidance in accounting research bulleting arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect sfas to have a material impact 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment was issued and replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based model 
deferred compensation calculated under the fair value method would then be amortized into income over the respective vesting period of the stock option 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas r will not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition as all stock options issued under the company s stock option plan are fully vested

the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
the company has not completed its analysis of the possible effect the phase out of the eti and phase in of this new deduction may have on the company 
under the guidance in fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no
