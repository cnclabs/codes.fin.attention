item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report and the critical accounting policies below for the year ended may  the company is a professional  full service provider of specialty industrial services 
the company s industrial service offerings encompass on stream leak repair  hot tapping  fugitive emissions monitoring  field machining  technical bolting  field valve repair  nde inspection and field heat treating 
all these services are required in maintaining high temperature  high pressure piping systems and vessels utilized extensively in the refining  petrochemical  power  pipeline  and other heavy industries 
the company s inspection services also serve the aerospace and automotive industries 
the company also sells and rents equipment through one of its business segments 
the company operates in over customer service locations throughout the unites states 
the company also serves the international market through both its own seven international subsidiaries as well as through licensed arrangements in countries 
the company s raw materials are readily available  and the company is not dependent on a single supplier or only a few suppliers 
the company has approximately  employees  including approximately  technical service employees 
we believe the domestic market for our services is principally dictated by the population of process piping systems in industrial plants and facilities 
on balance  we believe total demand for the services we offer in these markets does not change significantly 
it can be characterized as flat  but steady 
however  the timing of demand certainly can change in the short term as plants accelerate or defer maintenance and project activities due to their own economic environment 
we believe  therefore that our growth has been as a result of capturing market share in the services we offer 
as a context for the discussion below  the results of operations and financial condition of the company have been significantly impacted in the current fiscal year by the acquisition of thermal solutions  inc tsi in april of  and the acquisition of the business of cooperheat mqs  inc  cooperheat in august together  these acquisitions more than double the size of team s industrial services business and  we believe  will more than double our earnings potential by fiscal  as compared to fiscal year integration of these businesses with team s existing industrial services group has been the primary focus of management during the current fiscal year 
during the second quarter of the current fiscal year  we reorganized the operations of the industrial services segment into two related segments team mechanical services tms and team cooperheat mqs tcm 
tms comprises team s previously existing mechanical services offerings leak repair  hot tapping  field machining  technical bolting  field valve repair and fugitive emissions monitoring 
tcm comprises our field heat treatment and nde inspection services  consisting of the operations of team s two recent acquisitions tsi and cooperheat  as well as team s legacy nde business x ray inspection  inc for reporting purposes  we aggregate the tms and tcm segments because of their similar economic characteristics 

table of contents in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the elimination of redundant corporate facilities  conversion to a single financial erp system covering all cooperheat domestic operations  conversion to common employee benefit plans and payroll systems  the merger of all risk management programs  and extensive field level consolidation and training activities 
financing for the business acquisitions was provided through a million credit facility provided by a group of banks consisting of a revolving credit facility of million and a term loan of million 
in april  the company obtained a commitment from its banks to increase the revolving credit facility by million  which  in management s opinion  is sufficient to assure the company that adequate resources are available to meet all our foreseeable cash requirements 
a significant corporate initiative during the year was the documentation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the magnitude of the task to meet all of the documentation and testing requirements of the statute was far greater than we had estimated 
it consumed more resources and management time than estimated  particularly in the fourth quarter of as well as during the first quarter of fiscal total cost incurred in attributable to sox was million  with thousand of additional costs expected in the first quarter of to complete sox documentation and testing with respect to fiscal compared to fiscal revenues in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
operating income was million in versus million in  an increase of 
the acquisitions contributed million of the million revenue growth 
net income in was million per diluted share versus million per diluted share in as explained more fully below  the reduction in net income is due to a combination of factors  including lower margins in the industrial services segment  the incurrence of additional costs associated with the integration of tcm  significant costs of sox compliance and higher effective income tax rates 
the company reports results for two business segments industrial services and equipment sales and rentals  climax 
industrial services are the aggregate of the tcm and tms segments 
we measure the results of those segments using the metric  operating income  which excludes all costs for interest and income taxes  which we consider corporate costs and are not allocated to these business segments 
we believe that operating income is an appropriate performance measure to discuss since it allows investors to consider our operating performance without regard to financial leverage and capital structure 

table of contents the following sets forth the components of revenue and operating income for fiscal and s increase revenues industrial services tms tcm total industrial services equipment sales rentals total revenues gross margin industrial services tms tcm total industrial services of revenue equipment sales rentals of revenue of revenue s  g a expenses industrial services equipment sales rentals corporate costs of revenue operating income operating income comprised of segment operating income industrial services of revenue equipment sales rentals of revenue of revenue less corporate costs corporate g a total operating income of revenue industrial services segment segment operating income was million  up from the prior year 
segment operating income as a percent of revenue was  down percentage points from the prior year 
revenue growth is the primary driver of operating income growth 
lower gross margin percentages are due to the tcm operations of cooperheat whose margins are lower than our legacy team business and lower margins on major projects in tms 

table of contents total industrial services revenues were million in the current fiscal year  versus million in the same period last year 
approximately of industrial services revenues are from foreign operations  primarily in canada and the south america caribbean basin 
of the million in revenue growth  approximately million is from acquisitions and million is from our legacy tms business 
tms revenues for tms increased million or over  with approximately million of the increase coming from canada 
the first half of the current fiscal year was characterized by a very depressed market for turnaround services as very high profit margins earned by refineries caused them to push out turnaround work into later quarters 
although refiners continue to achieve high profit margins  we began to see an increase in turnaround activity in the second quarter  which has continued throughout the last half of the year 
tms gross margins were approximately four percentage points less than last year 
half of this decline occurred in the fourth quarter as a result of lower comparative margins earned on revenues with certain major customers in the quarter and low margins earned on a million project for a major customer in ecuador 
the comparatively lower margins associated with major customers is partly due to a high margin project that was completed in last year s quarter as well as the effect of incremental volume discounts earned by our customers in the fourth quarter 
the timing of annual sliding scale discount programs for two major refiners contributed to the low fourth quarter results as major turnaround projects performed in that period received the maximum discount levels within the annual cycle of those particular programs 
tcm tcm gross margins are significantly lower than those achieved by the tms services 
part of this difference is due to the fact that tcm projects are generally more labor intensive than tms service lines 
however  management expects gross margins to improve over time as the management tools associated with our financial information system have now been installed in the tcm units 
indeed  tcm margins have improved two percentage points to in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter 
selling general  and administrative expenses industrial services segment with respect to segment selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  of the total increase of million  million is associated with the additional field operations of the tcm acquired businesses 
thousand of the increase is due to integration activities approximately thousand and the customer dispute mentioned in item above thousand 
the remainder of the increase in sg a million primarily reflects increases in personnel to support the organic growth of the industrial services business segment 
equipment sales and rental segment revenues of climax were million versus million in the prior year  a increase 
the increase in revenues results from the higher penetration of sales into european and asian markets  which accounted for of revenues in  versus in the same period last year 
the year over year change also reflects the significant first quarter improvement due to a weak first quarter of last year s fiscal year 
operating income for climax improved by thousand year over year due to the overall growth in revenues 
corporate total corporate costs were million in  versus million in the increase of million includes the addition of accounting  human resources and information technology costs associated with support of the recent acquisitions as well as thousand of costs associated with integration activities and million in costs related to sarbanes oxley section compliance sox  including million incurred in the fourth quarter 
the company recognizes third party professional fees as services are rendered and  accordingly  will incur substantial additional costs in the first quarter of fiscal related to the completion of sox testing relating to fiscal year we believe first quarter costs will be approximately thousand 
sox compliance has required us to undertake a thorough documentation of all aspects of our internal financial control and financial reporting systems 
once we completed this thorough documentation  we tested the effectiveness of each individual key control within the system and developed a comprehensive assessment of the overall effectiveness of our controls 
management s report with respect to our assessment is included in item 
table of contents the magnitude of the task to meet all of the documentation and testing requirements of the statute was far greater than we had estimated 
it consumed more resources and management time than planned or forecast  particularly in the fourth quarter of as well as during the first quarter of fiscal in future years  we will be able build upon this year s work with respect to the overall control system description and documentation 
however  there will be ongoing significant efforts and costs associated with both ongoing internal testing of financial controls by team as well as extensive system assessment and testing by our external auditor 
interest total interest expense was million in as compared to million in this increase is directly associated with the additional borrowings to fund the acquisition of tsi april and cooperheat august  as well as the growth in working capital since the end of the first quarter 
see also the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 
taxes the provision for income taxes was million on pretax income of million for the effective tax rate for the year was compared to last year 
the rate differential is due evenly to three factors higher non deductible expenses in relation to taxable income  higher effective state income tax rates than last year approximately one percentage point  and a significant increase in foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the us federal income tax rate as a result  primarily  of our growth in canada 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
operating income was million in versus million in  an increase of 
net income in was million per diluted share versus million per diluted share in as explained more fully below  the increase in net income is due to primarily to the operating leverage associated with the significant organic revenue growth for both business segments in 
table of contents the following sets forth the components of revenue and operating profits for fiscal and s increase revenues total industrial services equipment sales rentals total revenues gross margin industrial services of revenue equipment sales rentals of revenue of revenue s  g a expenses industrial services equipment sales rentals corporate costs of revenue operating income operating income comprised of segment operating income industrial services of revenue equipment sales rentals of revenue of revenue less corporate costs corporate g a total operating income of revenue industrial services for the year  the industrial services business segment revenues increased to million 
segment operating income increased to million 
a significant contributor to revenue growth in industrial services in came from the full year impact of a new service line  field valve repair  which was introduced in the spring of this service line contributed million of the growth  primarily associated with two major turnaround projects in the summer and fall of the segment also benefited from new and expanded fugitive emissions monitoring contracts in the west coast region of the united states and from turnaround activity in the gulf coast and the caribbean 
additionally  the acquisition of tsi in april contributed million to industrial services revenue 
however  due to the seasonality of field heat treating  it did not contribute to operating income for the industrial services segment 
the only service line that did not experience revenue growth during the year was nde inspection  which was down million year over year  due to continued softness in pipeline construction activities 

table of contents equipment sales and rentals segment the equipment sales and rental business segment encompassing climax portable machine tool company grew revenues for the year to million 
revenue growth for the year was primarily attributable to the shipment of special tool orders in the third and fourth quarters aggregating over million 
operating income increased to million versus thousand in consolidated operating results with regard to consolidated operating results  overall gross margins were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decline primarily reflects the downturn in nde inspection revenues associated with pipeline and pulp paper customer segments as well as lower profit margins from the tsi revenues due to slow seasonal activity in the two months after the acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million in versus  an increase of 
the overall increase in sga reflects significant increases in incentive compensation  safety training and legal expenses over the prior year 
in spite of these elements of cost increase  as a percentage of revenue  sg a was down of revenues in fiscal versus of revenues in fiscal non cash compensation expense increased by thousand in versus due to the achievement of a stock price hurdle of per share  which resulted in the vesting of  options held by the chief executive officer and the recognition of the unamortized compensation expense associated with these options 
other expense  net netted in other expense in is a thousand gain from the sale of idle real estate 
that is offset by a charge of  for estimated losses pertaining to a sales tax matter 
a similar charge of thousand was recorded in climax is domiciled in the state of oregon  which is a state that imposes no tax on sales originating there 
in fiscal  management determined that climax does have an obligation to collect and remit sales taxes in certain other jurisdictions  which it had not previously done 
a cumulative thousand was charged to earnings with respect to this matter through liquidity and capital resources in connection with the cooperheat acquisition  the company replaced its previous credit facility with a new million facility consisting of a million revolving loan and a million term facility  which matures in august approximately million was borrowed on august  to finance the cooperheat acquisition and to refinance amounts outstanding on the previous facilities 
the term facility requires amortization of million in the first year  million in year two and million in each of years three through five 
amortization began in november interest on the facility is at libor at may  plus a margin which is variable depending upon the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
initially  the margin is basis points above the libor rate 
the new facility is secured by virtually all the company s assets  including those acquired in the cooperheat mqs transaction 
the company paid an underwriters fee of of the aggregate amount of the facility 
the terms of the agreement require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit investments  liens  leases and indebtedness  and dividends  among other things 
at may   the company was in compliance with all credit facility covenants 
in april  we obtained an additional revolving loan commitment from our banks for million to address short term working capital requirements caused by our rapid business growth 
at the same time  the banks agreed to modify a financial covenant effective may  to allow the ratio of debt to ebitda to be a maximum of to at may   reducing by basis points per quarter until the requirement becomes to at the end of the third quarter of we believe this additional commitment is sufficient to meet our requirements because we are at the peak of working capital growth associated with our annual business cycle 
for fiscal  we used million of cash in our operating activities  primarily as a result of a substantial growth in accounts receivable million  net of effects of accounts receivable acquired in the cooperheat 
table of contents transaction 
the growth in accounts receivable reflects the substantial sequential increases in revenues in the second  third  and fourth quarters over first quarter pro forma levels of million as if cooperheat acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period 
we have also seen a lengthening of our days sales outstanding during the year primarily due to a diversion of management s focus on collection activities during the integration process and as a result of delays in paying accounts receivable by a customer pending the settlement of a dispute see item 
as the business cycle leveled off in the summer of and as focus was re applied to our collections efforts  we have seen a significant improvement in cash flows into the first quarter of at july   our outstanding debt was reduced by million from year end levels as a result of these collection activities 
in  we used million of cash in investing activities principally capital expenditures in addition to the funds used for the cooperheat acquisition million  net 
with the additional million financing commitment obtained in april  in the opinion of management  we currently have sufficient funds and adequate financial sources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs 
management believes that cash flows from operations  cash balances and available borrowings will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
at may   the company was contingently liable for million in outstanding stand by letters of credit and there was million of borrowing capacity under the revolving loan 
critical accounting policies goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets with estimated useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result of the company s purchase of the assets of cooperheat as well as incurring additional fees relating to the acquisition of tsi  an additional million in goodwill has been added to the balance sheet since may  for purposes of computing the annual impairment test  the reporting units are the team cooperheat mqs tcm component of the industrial services segment and the equipment sales and rental segment 
all goodwill assigned to those reporting units is attributable to business acquisitions that are part of those units 
there is no goodwill assigned to the team mechanical services tms division of the industrial services segment 
the annual impairment test is conducted by first comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount and then comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using a multiple of the units operating income and comparing that to a discounted future cash flow estimate 
based upon this assessment  there has been no impairment of goodwill at may  or revenue recognition the company derives its revenues by providing a variety of industrial services including leak repair  hot tapping  emissions control monitoring  field machining  technical bolting  field valve repair  field heat treating and non destructive testing examination inspection services 
in addition  the company sells and rents portable machine tools through one of its subsidiaries 
for all of these services  revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when product is shipped and risk of ownership passes to the customer 

table of contents because most of the company s projects are short term in nature  revenue recognition does not involve a significant use of estimates  as would be the case if our services were longer term in nature 
at the end of each reporting period there is an amount of earned but unbilled revenue that is accrued to properly match revenues with related costs 
at may   the amount of unbilled revenue was million 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company computes its deferred tax balances by multiplying these temporary differences by the current tax rates 
if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities  the company must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future 
a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized 
as of may  management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will have sufficient future taxable income to allow it to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets 
our belief is based upon our track record of consistent earnings growth over the past five years and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
loss contingencies the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  management consults with its legal counsel and evaluates the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time 
currently  the company is involved with two significant matters  which are summarized in legal proceedings above 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of may  to provide for any losses that may arise from these contingencies 
critical expense estimates certain costs and expenses are subject to a significant degree of estimation whose outcome is not certain until the passage of time 
among these estimates are the provision for doubtful accounts as well as claims expense associated with workers compensation  automobile liability and group health insurance claims  for which the company is self insured to certain stop loss limits 
for workers compensation and automobile liability claims  the self insured retention is  per case 
for medical claims  the self insured retention is  per individual claimant determined on an annual basis 
the company estimates it liability with respect to self insured retention amounts on the basis of claims information provided by insurance carriers and makes periodic adjustments to its accruals based upon analysis received from the carriers 
the provision for doubtful accounts is based managements best estimate of the ultimate uncollectible accounts based upon its analysis of the agings of individual accounts and with reference to the company s historical experience 
other contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company enters into operating leases related to facilities and transportation and other equipment 
these operating leases are over terms ranging from one to five years with typical renewal options and escalation clauses 
the company is occasionally required to post letters of credit generally issued by a bank as collateral under certain agreements 
a letter of credit commits the issuer to remit specified amounts to the holder  if the holder demonstrates that the company has failed to meet its obligations under the letter of credit 
if this were to occur  the company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer for any payments the issuer was required to remit to the holder of the letter of credit 
to date  the company has not had any claims made against a letter of credit that resulted in a payment made be the issuer or the company to the holder 
the company believes that it is unlikely that it will have to fund claims made under letters of credit in the foreseeable future 
at may   million was outstanding under standby letters of credit to secure  generally  workers compensation and automobile liability insurance contracts 
the company generally warrants its work for a period of no longer than one year 
warranty costs have not been significant to the company

revised share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its equity instruments for employee services 
it also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services 
for public entities  the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments  including employee stock options  is to be measured on the grant date fair value of those instruments 
that cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the service period  which would normally be the vesting period 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal management does not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the company s operating results 
in november  fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date sfas no
