item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in north america and the united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in items and of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling its oil and natural gas production and its refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in north america that are primarily located at wal mart stores  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s downstream operations are dependent upon achieving an adequate margin  which is determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of refinery feedstocks and gasoline purchases and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
in general  worldwide oil prices and north american natural gas prices were stronger in than in the average price for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil in was  an increase of compared to the nymex natural gas price averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu in  up over these price improvements were a significant factor leading to higher profits in the company s exploration and production business in compared to the prior year 
if the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations the company had net income in of million  per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  per diluted share 
in the company earned million  per diluted share 
the higher net income in compared to was caused by a combination of better earnings in the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing operations  partially offset by higher net costs for corporate functions 
the income improvement in compared to was due to higher earnings in the exploration and production business  a smaller loss in the refining and marketing area  and lower net costs for corporate functions 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections

income from continuing operations totaled million  per share  in compared to million  per share  in the million improvement in income from continuing operations in was due to a combination of higher earnings from the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing operating businesses 
higher net costs of corporate activities partially offset the better results from these operating businesses 
exploration and production e p operating results improved million mostly due to higher oil and natural gas sales prices  higher oil sales volumes  and a million deferred income tax benefit in malaysia due to the expectation that temporary differences associated with exploration and other costs incurred to date in block k will be utilized to reduce future taxable income 
the e p results were unfavorably affected in by higher exploration expenses and lower natural gas sales volumes compared to refining and marketing r m operating results improved by million in compared to primarily due to much stronger realized margins on petroleum products sold by the us and us businesses 
the net costs of corporate activities were million higher in because of a withholding tax on a million dividend to murphy oil corporation from the company s canadian subsidiary  unfavorable foreign exchange variances  a million tax benefit in related to settlement of us tax matters  lower capitalized interest costs due to the completion of significant e p development projects  and higher administrative expenses related mostly to sarbanes oxley compliance and retirement plans 
the canadian withholding tax in amounted to million of costs 
foreign exchange losses were million after tax in compared to a benefit of million in these losses were primarily associated with us dollar balances of cash and other net assets held by the company s canadian and uk subsidiaries  which generally use local currency as their functional currency for bookkeeping purposes 
sales and other operating revenues in increased billion compared to mostly due to higher prices for oil  natural gas and petroleum products sold  higher sales volumes of crude oil and petroleum products  and higher merchandise sales revenue at retail gasoline stations 
gain on sale of assets increased by million in due to a higher profit on sales of e p properties in the year compared to interest and other income was unfavorable by million in versus mostly because of pretax foreign exchange losses of million in compared to gains of million in  the foreign exchange effects were partially offset by higher interest income earned on invested cash balances during crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in due to the higher prices for crude oil purchased as refinery feedstocks and petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher purchased volumes of crude oil  petroleum products and merchandise for resale compared to operating expenses increased million in with the change due to higher lifting costs caused by crude oil production growth and higher unit rates  higher refining and gasoline station expenses  and higher insurance and repair costs caused mostly by storms in the gulf of mexico 
exploration expenses rose by million in mostly due to higher dry hole costs offshore eastern canada and in malaysia 
selling and general expenses were million higher in the current year and increased due to consulting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  plus increases for salaries  retirement and other benefits  and incentive compensation 
depreciation  depletion and amortization rose by million mostly due to higher production of crude oil and higher depreciation of refining and marketing assets 
property impairments of million in related to write down of a refined products terminal closed by the company  write off of certain property costs that were rendered obsolete at the meraux refinery and the write down of a natural gas field in the gulf of mexico due to downward revisions in reserves caused by poor well performance 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by 
million  mostly due to drilling wells and facilities added during interest expense was million less than in mostly due to lower average debt outstanding during capitalized interest credited to income and included in capital expenditures decreased by million due to completion of the medusa development project in the gulf of mexico and the expansion project at the meraux refinery

refining and marketing results in both north america and the united kingdom showed significant improvements in most of the improvement in north america was generated by stronger margins in the retail marketing portion of the business 
higher margins in the uk led to better income from this area 
the net costs of corporate activities were lower in primarily due to higher corporate income tax benefits related to settlement of prior year tax matters and lower net interest costs  partially offset by higher selling and general expenses 

table of contents sales and other operating revenues in increased by billion compared to due to higher sales volumes for crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  higher sales prices for oil  natural gas and refined products  and higher merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations 
gain on sale of assets was million higher in primarily due to a million pretax profit on sale of the ninian and columba fields in the uk north sea 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by million in due to higher costs of crude oil used for refinery feedstock  and higher costs and volumes of gasoline and merchandise purchased for sale at the company s retail gasoline stations 
operating expenses increased by million in due to higher operating and repair costs at refineries and higher operating costs at the company s growing retail gasoline station chain 
selling and general expenses rose by million in primarily due to higher retirement and incentive compensation expenses and higher costs for malaysian operations 
exploration expenses were million lower in mostly due to less exploratory costs incurred in malaysia 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million in due to new production from the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  and higher depreciation associated with the company s growing retail gasoline station chain 
impairment of long lived assets was million lower in as the prior year included costs related to write off of destin dome blocks and  offshore florida 
the statement of income included million for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of sfas no 
on january  because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the time the abandonment occurs 
interest expense rose by million in due to higher average borrowings under long term debt during the year 
the portion of interest capitalized increased by million due to higher capital expenditures for development of deepwater gulf of mexico fields and expansion projects at syncrude and the meraux refinery 
income tax expense was million more in mostly caused by higher pretax earnings  the effects of which were partially offset by a million benefit from settlement of prior year tax audits in the us  a million benefit related to enacted tax rate reductions in canada  and an million credit from recognition of deferred tax benefits in malaysia

a summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom oil and gas liquids natural gas malaysia crude oil ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels in oil production in was a new annual record for murphy oil 
the increase in worldwide oil production was primarily attributable to production growth in the us and malaysia 
oil production in canada and the uk declined in compared to us oil production increased more than to  barrels per day due to a full year of production in from the medusa and habanero fields 
both these fields came on stream in november heavy oil production in canada increased to  barrels per day due to a heavy oil drilling program in the seal area during  plus additional producing acreage acquired in this area during the fourth quarter of production at the hibernia field off the east coast of canada was essentially flat with at  barrels per day  but the terra nova field saw production decrease to  barrels per day  with the decline mostly due to mechanical problems and an oil spill that occurred during the year 
net synthetic oil production from the syncrude project was  barrels per day  a increase from the increase at syncrude was in line with higher gross production  which was caused by better operational efficiency and less downtime in compared to oil production in the uk was lower by and averaged  barrels per day 
the company sold its interest in the t block field in and the ninian and columba fields in also  production from the schiehallion and mungo monan fields was down in due to normal decline 
production in ecuador rose almost in due to a full year of operation of the new heavy oil pipeline 
in prior years  production restrictions were in effect due to limitations caused by inadequate pipeline capacity between the primary oil producing region in the country s interior to the coast where sales occur 
in spite of the higher ecuadorian production in  total sales volumes in this country in were lower than because no sales occurred from block during the second half of the year due to a dispute with the operator of the field over murphy s new transportation and marketing arrangements 
murphy expects to make up this sales volume shortfall of over million barrels in malaysian oil production rose in and averaged  barrels per day  caused by a full year of production in the current year from the west patricia field in block sk versus a partial year in comparing to  oil production in the united states increased to  barrels per day 
production from two new deepwater gulf of mexico fields medusa and habanero that came on stream in november more than offset production declines from mature fields 
oil production in canada increased in to  barrels per day 
the production increase was primarily related to higher volumes produced offshore newfoundland at the terra nova and hibernia fields 
production at terra nova increased and averaged  barrels per day in hibernia production increased by to  barrels per day in net production from the synthetic oil operation known as syncrude fell barrels per day  or  in due to less efficient operations caused by more downtime for repairs 
production of light oil decreased barrels per day  or  due to continued field decline and various property sales during the year 
heavy oil production in canada increased  barrels per day  or  during due to the results of development drilling  which was partially offset by lower production from various properties sold during the year 
uk production was down by  barrels per day  or  primarily due to sale of the ninian and columba fields in mid and production decline at the mungo monan field 
the company produced  barrels of oil per day in 
table of contents ecuador  higher than in  primarily due to a new heavy oil pipeline that began operations in the last half of production began at the company s west patricia field in block sk  offshore sarawak malaysia  in may net production from west patricia averaged  barrels per day for all  but averaged over  barrels per day since start up 
worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in sales of natural gas in the united states were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in sales in the us increased in as higher volumes produced during the full production year at the medusa and habanero fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico more than offset declines at other more mature fields 
sales volumes were unfavorably affected by hurricane ivan which temporarily shut in most production in the central gulf of mexico and severely damaged certain facilities  such as at the tahoe field in viosca knoll block  which was off production for the entire fourth quarter following the storm 
the reduction in us sales volumes was due to lower deliverability from mature fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas sales from continuing operations in canada fell from million cubic feet per day in to million in  a reduction of 
the decrease was mostly caused by normal production decline at the rimbey gas field 
canadian natural gas sales had increased in due to higher production volumes at rimbey 
natural gas sales in the united kingdom were down from million cubic feet per day in  to million cubic feet in the decrease in was due to normal declines at the amethyst field in the uk north sea 
natural gas sales volumes were up in compared to due primarily to higher sales nominations at the amethyst 
worldwide crude oil sales prices have risen in each of the last two years 
oil prices rose in due to a strong world economy  real and perceived instability in worldwide crude oil production levels  and effective production output controls by opec producers 
murphy realized on average crude oil and condensate sales price of per barrel in  a increase over the realized average price of 
the worldwide average price was reduced per barrel by the effects of the company s hedging program 
the company had hedged the sales price in for most of its heavy oil production in canada and light oil production in the us  as well as a portion of its offshore and synthetic crude production in canada 
the average sales price in the us was per barrel in  up 
canadian heavy oil prices increased in  and averaged per barrel 
the company s selling price for canadian offshore production from the hibernia and terra nova fields averaged per barrel in  up versus synthetic oil production at syncrude averaged per barrel in  higher than in murphy s uk north sea oil production averaged selling for per barrel in the current year  higher than oil production sold for per barrel in ecuador and per barrel in malaysia  increases of and  respectively 
no sales occurred from block in ecuador during the second half of due to a dispute with the field s operator over murphy s new transportation and marketing arrangements 
because of the lack of sales  the company s ecuador operations did not benefit from higher average oil prices during the last six months of the just completed year 
murphy expects to make up this sales volume shortfall of over million barrels in the company s average realized sales price for crude oil and condensate in was per barrel compared to in the us average crude oil sales price was essentially flat with and averaged per barrel 
light oil production in canada was sold at an average of per barrel in  up from heavy canadian oil sold at per barrel in  lower than in the average sales prices for offshore and synthetic oil production in canada were per barrel and per barrel  respectively 
offshore prices were higher than  but synthetic crude was lower by 
the average sales price in the uk increased by to per barrel 
ecuador production was sold at an average of per barrel  which was above the average for new production from the west patricia field in malaysia brought an average of per barrel in in association with the higher oil prices  the sales prices for natural gas also strengthened in the company s gas producing markets during each of the past two years 
the company s average realized sales price for north american natural gas was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  higher than the previous year 
the price was reduced by 
per mcf because of the company s hedging program in the us and canada 
in  the average natural gas sales price realized by the company in north america was per mcf  higher than in in the us  natural gas sales prices averaged per mcf in  up compared to canadian gas prices increased to an average of per mcf 
natural gas was sold in the uk at an average of per mcf  higher than the average 
based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and 
per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 

table of contents production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel excluding discontinued operations during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom malaysia ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil the higher costs in the united states in were due primarily to lower production and higher costs for properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
the lower us cost in was due to both higher production and less well servicing costs 
higher average canadian costs excluding synthetic oil in were caused by lower natural gas production and a higher average foreign exchange rate 
the decline in canadian unit rate in was caused by a decrease in offshore costs plus the effects of higher offshore production 
the increase in unit costs for canadian synthetic oil operations in was attributable to a combination of higher maintenance and energy costs and a higher foreign exchange rate  the increase per unit was due to the same factors as  plus the effects of lower barrels produced 
lower average costs in the uk in each of the last two years were mainly due to sale of high cost properties  including t block in and ninian and columba in the increase in the unit rate in malaysia in compared to was primarily due to higher manpower  fuel and export duty costs 
production expense increases per unit in ecuador were mostly attributable to higher transportation costs associated with the heavy oil pipeline that commenced operations in the second half of exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploration and production dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry hole costs were million higher in than because of more costs for unsuccessful drilling on the scotian shelf  offshore eastern canada  and in block k malaysia 
dry holes were million lower in than primarily due to more drilling success in deepwater malaysia blocks in the later year 
geological and geophysical expenses were million lower in  mostly due to lower seismic acquisition and interpretation work offshore eastern canada  partially offset by higher seismic costs in malaysia 
geological and geophysical costs were up million in mostly due to d seismic acquisition and processing in blocks sk and pm in malaysia 
other exploration expenses were million higher in than mainly due to more costs for gulf of mexico annual lease rentals and higher charges for work commitments on leases on the scotian shelf offshore eastern canada 
other exploration expenses were million lower in because more administrative costs in malaysia were charged to the production department after start up of west patricia field production in may 
undeveloped leasehold amortization increased by million in and million in because of lease acquisitions in each year in the gulf of mexico  plus the acquisition in of two exploration concessions in the deep waters offshore the republic of congo 
costs of million and million were incurred in and  respectively  to repair equipment and well damages caused by hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
these costs essentially represent amounts not recovered through insurance policies 
the company s exploration and production operations also recorded a million pretax cost in for a retrospective insurance premium related to past claims experience of the insurer 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in compared to was caused primarily by higher production at the medusa and habanero fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico and the west patricia field in block sk malaysia 
the million increase in was mostly due to higher production in canada and start up of the west patricia field in 
table of contents the exploration and production business recorded expense of million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of sfas no 
on january  because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
property impairments occurred in the united states in and impairment charges of million in related to the writedown of the cost of a natural gas field in the gulf of mexico for a reserve reduction caused by poor well performance 
the impairment in of million was mostly related to writeoff of the remaining investment of million in destin dome blocks and  offshore florida 
based on an agreement with the us government  the company may not seek approval for development of this significant natural gas discovery until at least the remainder of the charge also related to impairments for poor natural gas well performance in the us the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was in  in  and in the effective tax rates in and were lower than statutory rates partially due to recognition of deferred income tax benefits in malaysia in each year 
the deferred tax benefit of million arose due to the expectation that temporary differences associated with exploration and other expenses incurred to date in block k malaysia will be utilized to reduce future taxable income 
an million deferred tax benefit was recognized in for similar circumstances in malaysia blocks sk and these benefits had not been recognized in the income statement in previous years because the company had established a deferred tax valuation allowance until such time that it became probable that these expenses would be utilized as deductions to reduce future taxable income 
in  alberta reduced their tax rates for oil and gas companies 
in  both the federal and alberta governments of canada reduced their tax rates for oil and gas companies 
the rate reductions led to recognition of a million benefit in and a million tax benefit in  mostly related to a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities 
in addition  the effective tax rate in was favorable to due to sale of the company s interests in the ninian and columba fields in profits on these fields were assessed petroleum revenue taxes in addition to normal corporation taxes  thus the sale of these fields reduced the overall effective tax rate in the uk approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
at december   about of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
almost of these undeveloped reserves relate to the front runner field  which came on stream in december seven of the eight wells at front runner were not completed and or producing at year end  these wells are expected to be brought into production sequentially during and early in addition  oil reserves in block k in malaysia of million barrels at year end are all undeveloped  pending completion of facilities and development drilling in future years 
this field is projected to be on production in the second half of on a worldwide basis  the company spent approximately million in  million in  and million in to develop proved reserves 
the company expects to spend about million in  million in and million in to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category 
refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing operations generated a profit of million in  after posting losses of million in and million in the r m operating results improved markedly in because the company was able to extract a higher gross margin from product sales in both the us and us markets 
although the price of crude oil  the primary refinery feedstock  was much more costly during than in  the supplies of gasoline and certain other products remained tight during much of the year 
thus refining margins in both the us and us were much stronger during the meraux refinery also ran more efficiently in than in  and therefore  the costs of operations were spread over a larger number of crude oil barrels  benefiting margins on a per unit basis 
murphy also enjoyed better profits from its murphy usa retail station chain in  essentially due to a combination of higher volumes sold  a better markup of gasoline prices compared to laid in costs  and lower operating costs per gallon sold 
the company added stations to its chain during  an increase of over the number of sites at year end sales volume per station increased more than in compared to the loss from r m operations was lower than the loss by million primarily due to better margins from the gasoline retail business in north america and the refining and marketing business in the united kingdom 
the company s us refining margins were squeezed in  primarily due to the high price of crude oil that the company was not able to completely pass through to wholesale and other refinery customers 
in addition to higher average fuel margins in at north american retail gasoline stations  the company s profits from merchandise sales at these gasoline stations were also better than in geographically  the north american r m operations had income of million in after incurring losses of million in and million in north american operations include refining activities in the united states and marketing activities in the united states and canada 
operations in the uk generated a record profit of million in  compared to a profit of million in and a 
million loss in unit margins sales realizations less costs of crude oil and other feedstocks  refinery operating and depreciation expenses and transportation to point of sale averaged per barrel in north america in  in and 
in north american product sales volumes increased to a record  barrels per day in  following a increase in sales volumes through the company s retail gasoline network at wal mart stores grew steadily throughout and 
table of contents unit margins in the united kingdom averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in sales of petroleum products were up in following a increase in the increase was primarily caused by higher volumes sold in both the retail and cargo market  while the increase in was mostly attributable to cargo market sales growth 
us refining and marketing operations were experiencing losses in early as this business was unable at that time to pass along the higher costs of crude oil feedstocks to its customers buying refined products such as gasoline and diesel 
based on sales volumes for and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each 
per barrel 
per gallon fluctuation in the unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by million 
the effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s exploration and production segments could be affected differently 
corporate the costs of corporate activities  which include interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in  million in and million in net after tax corporate costs in were million higher than in the increase was related to unfavorable foreign exchange losses  higher administrative costs  higher net interest expense and unfavorable income taxes 
due to a much weaker us dollar compared to the canadian dollar  pound sterling and the euro  the company incurred after tax losses of million for foreign exchange in compared to a million profit in the exchange losses were mostly attributable to foreign subsidiaries with non us dollar functional currencies holding a significant level of us dollars that experienced devaluation against these other currencies during the last half of administrative expenses were million higher in  mostly due to higher costs of corporate compliance under the sarbanes oxley act and higher salaries  retirement and other benefits and other compensation expenses 
net interest expense was million higher in  mostly due to lower interest being capitalized on us oil and gas developments and us refinery expansion projects that are now completed and the assets in service 
income tax expense in was unfavorable by million in the corporate area primarily due to a million withholding tax incurred on a million dividend paid to the company by its canadian subsidiary  and a million tax benefit in from settlement of previous years income tax audit issues 
the company earned million more interest income in mostly related to holding larger balances of invested cash for a portion of the year after selling most of its conventional oil and gas properties in western canada 
net after tax corporate costs were million lower in than in mainly due to a million benefit from settlement of previous years us income tax audit issues and lower net interest expense 
these cost savings were partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses  including costs related to the company s retirement and incentive compensation plans

capital expenditures on the superior refinery unit green gasoline were million in and million in capital expenditures related to the meraux expansion project amounted to million in  million in and million in marketing expenditures amounted to million in and million in and the majority of marketing expenditures in each year was related to construction of retail gasoline stations at wal mart sites in states in the us the company added total stations to this retail network in  in and in cash flows cash provided by continuing operations was  million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided in was primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product sales volumes  and higher sales prices for crude oil  natural gas and refined products 
cash provided by continuing operations was reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling million in  million in and million in scheduled plant wide turnarounds occurred at both us refineries in 
table of contents cash proceeds from property sales other than from discontinued operations were million in  million in and million in the property sales included the disposal of the t block field in the uk north sea and certain uk onshore gas properties and uk marketing terminals while included disposal of the ninian and columba fields in the uk and various oil and gas assets in canada and the gulf of mexico 
disposals of properties classified as discontinued operations brought in net cash proceeds of million in this disposal included most of the company s conventional oil and gas properties in western canada 
during and  the company borrowed under notes payable and other long term debt arrangements primarily to fund a portion of the company s development capital expenditures  these borrowings provided million of cash in and million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans amounted to million in  million in and million in property additions and dry hole costs used cash of million in  million in and million in a heavy oil property acquisition in canada  plus higher heavy oil development spending and higher exploration drilling in malaysia were the primary reasons for the increase in more field development expenditures in the deepwater gulf of mexico and at the west patricia and kikeh fields in malaysia mostly accounted for the increase 
the company used a portion of the proceeds of asset dispositions classified as discontinued operations to repay a significant portion of long term debt in total paydown of debt was million during cash outlays for debt repayment during and were million and million  respectively 
cash of million was invested in in us government securities with maturities greater than days 
cash used for dividends to stockholders was million in  million in and million in the company raised its annualized dividend rate from 
per share to 
per share beginning in the third quarter of the company had previously increased the annualized dividend rate from 
per share to 
per share at mid year financial condition year end working capital totaled million in  million in and million in the current level of working capital does not fully reflect the company s liquidity position as the carrying values for inventories under last in first out accounting were million below fair value at december  cash and cash equivalents at the end of totaled million compared to million a year ago and million at the end of long term debt was reduced by million during and totaled million at the end of the year  of total capital employed 
long term debt included million of nonrecourse debt incurred in connection with the hibernia oil field 
the long term debt reduction in was achieved primarily using the proceeds of asset dispositions in western canada 
long term debt totaled billion at the end of compared to million at december  stockholders equity was billion at the end of compared to billion a year ago and billion at the end of a summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page f of this form k report 
other significant changes in murphy s year end balance sheet compared to included a million increase in accounts receivable  which was primarily caused by sales of higher volumes of crude oil and refined products at higher average prices near the end of compared to the year end 
crude oil and blend stocks inventory was million more than mostly because of million barrels of unsold crude oil inventory in ecuador 
the company did not receive its allocated share of ecuadorian production to sell for approximately the last seven months of due to a dispute with the area operator over our new transportation and marketing arrangements 
short term deferred income tax assets increased million at year end due mostly to a deferred tax benefit recorded in in ecuador  this benefit offset a current tax charge related to a temporary difference associated with the timing of income reported for book and tax purposes 
net property  plant and equipment increased by million as capital expenditures during the year were larger than the cost of properties disposed and the additional depreciation and amortization expensed 
goodwill related to the acquisition of beau canada in decreased by million as a portion of goodwill was allocated to the cost pool for the sale of western canada properties in deferred charges and other assets increased million in due to the net change in long term deferred tax assets for malaysian operations 
current maturities of long term debt declined by million primarily because of paydown of hibernia nonrecourse loans 
accounts payable rose by million mostly due to the higher costs of purchased crude oil and gasoline at year end compared to income taxes payable increased million at year end due to combination of higher operating profits in and a liability associated with settlement of all beau canada exploration acquisition financing matters with the canadian tax authorities during early other taxes payable increased million mostly due to higher sales  use and excise taxes owed at year end compared to deferred income tax liabilities increased million in due mostly to higher accelerated depreciation taken in tax returns based on property acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
the liability associated with asset retirements dropped by million mostly due to sales of western canada conventional oil and gas properties and t block in the north sea during accrued major repair costs increased by million primarily based on accruing additional costs for future turnarounds of the company s three refineries 
murphy had commitments of million for capital projects in progress at december   including million for costs to develop deepwater gulf of mexico fields  million for continued expansion of synthetic oil operations in canada  million for field development and future work commitments in malaysia  and million for exploration drilling in congo 

table of contents the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company typically relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
at december   the company had access to short term and long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of million 
none of the revolving facilities had been drawn at year end the most restrictive covenants under these facilities limit the company s long term debt to capital ratio as defined in the agreements to 
at december   the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 
the company also has unused uncommitted credit lines of approximately million at december  in addition  the company has a shelf registration on file with the us securities and exchange commission that permits the offer and sale of up to million in debt and equity securities 
current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
at present  the company does not anticipate utilizing a significant amount of its long term borrowing capacity in as normal cash flow from operations is expected to cover the company s capital expenditure program 
at march  the company s long term debt rating by standard and poor s was a and by moody s was baal 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in  to in and to in environmental murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the company s operations are the clean air act  as amended the federal water pollution control act safe drinking water act regulations of the united states department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations these acts and their associated regulations set limits on emissions and  in the case of discharges to water  establish water quality limits 
they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
many states also have similar statutes and regulations governing air and water  which in some cases impose additional and more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills 
the applicable acts are the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  commonly referred to as superfund  and comparable state statutes 
cercla primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites 
as discussed below  murphy is involved in a limited number of superfund sites 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous 
the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  and comparable state statutes  govern the management and disposal of wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owner s property 
the oil pollution act of  as amended  under which owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
pursuant to the authority of the clean air act caa  the environmental protection agency epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used 
pursuant to state laws corresponding to the caa  several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including three refineries  five terminals  and approximately service stations  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
in addition the company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount 
the us environmental protection agency epa currently considers the company to be a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available 
table of contents information  the company believes that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at both superfund sites 
the company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other superfund sites 
the company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean up the two superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
however  based on information currently available to the company  the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december  the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and various industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
because crude oil and natural gas sales prices have generally strengthened during the last two years  prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected in the future 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements as described in note g on page f of this form k report  murphy adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded an after tax charge of million  which was reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
revised requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized as an expense in the financial statements using a fair value based measurement method over the periods that the awards vest 
the statement will be effective for the company beginning in its third quarter which starts on july  the company is currently evaluating which fair value measurement method to use and whether to use the modified retrospective application or modified prospective application upon adoption 
although the company currently uses the intrinsic value approach of accounting principles board no 
to account for stock options  it provides pro forma disclosures in note a as if sfas no 
was currently being applied 
the fasb has issued for comment a proposed fasb staff position fsp a to provide guidance on the accounting for exploratory well costs and to propose an amendment to sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the guidance in fsp a will apply to companies that use the successful efforts method of accounting as described in sfas no 
this proposed fsp would clarify that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating validity of the project 
the guidance in this fsp is to be applied in the first reporting period beginning after the date the fsp is finalized 
the guidance will be applied prospectively to existing and newly capitalized exploratory well costs 
however  any capitalized well costs that do not meet the requirements of the fsp must be written off upon its adoption 
the proposed fsp as written requires additional disclosures related to capitalized costs 
the emerging issues task force eitf has issued eitf  applying the conditions in paragraph of sfas no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
the eitf generally believes that current practice with respect to applying the criteria in paragraph of 
table of contents sfas no 
has not been applied consistently and has not resulted in broadening the reporting of asset dispositions as discontinued operations 
eitf contains further guidance for evaluating the cash flows of the component sold and what constitutes significant continuing involvement 
this standard must be applied to all asset disposal transactions occurring after january  eitf may lead in certain industries to more asset disposals being reported as discontinued operations in future periods 
however  in the oil and gas industry  it may cause more asset disposals to continue to be classified as continuing operations due to clarification of what constitutes continuing involvement 
in october  the president of the united states signed into law the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act 
the fasb issued fsp in december to provide guidance on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the provision within the act that provides  beginning in  a tax deduction of up to on qualified production activities 
fsp concludes that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas  which means that the tax benefit is recognized as realized  rather than as a one time benefit due to a reduction of deferred tax liabilities 
this fsp was effective upon issuance 
the company cannot predict what impact the act will have on net income in future periods 
sfas no 
 inventory costs was issued by the fasb in november this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges  and it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the related production facilities 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the provisions of this statement will be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on its results of operations 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 in december this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the provisions of this statement will be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on its results of operations 
in the fasb reviewed whether mineral interests in properties mineral leases held by oil and gas companies should be recorded and disclosed as intangible assets under the guidance of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
after consideration of the matter  the fasb issued a staff position stating that drilling and mineral rights of oil and gas producing entities that are within the scope of sfas are not subject to the intangible asset classification and disclosure rules of sfas no 
the staff position is consistent with the company s present accounting practices and had no effect on its financial statements or disclosures 
significant accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities 
year end prices often do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of the annual report 
the reserve revision for us oil in relates primarily to loss of royalty relief for the medusa and front runner deepwater fields based on year end oil prices 
oil reserve revisions in canada in relate to a combination of low heavy oil prices at year end that restrict economic recoverability of certain heavy oil reserves and higher projected royalties at the terra nova and hibernia fields 
oil reserve revisions in ecuador in were caused by a higher than previously estimated water cut in the liquid stream produced at block natural gas reserve revisions were positive in the us due to better well performance 
the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 

table of contents successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
when further drilling is firmly planned or in progress  the company holds these well costs in property  plant and equipment until the drilling is completed 
in cases where oil and gas reserves have been found but can not be classified as proved within one year after an exploratory well is drilled  the company will hold such well costs in property when classification of proved reserves are dependent upon  and we are actively seeking  approval of a development plan by a foreign government 
costs of all exploration wells in progress at year end amounted to million 
through early march  these wells were either still drilling or successfully found hydrocarbon deposits  certain of which are still being evaluated by the company 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
dry hole expenses related to wells drilled in prior years were million in and million in impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
a description of impairment charges recorded during the last three years is included in note d in the consolidated financial statements 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserve and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in making impairment assessments for refining and marketing property and equipment  future margins for the refining and marketing business are generally projected based on historical results adjusted for known or expected changes in future operations 
although the company is not aware of any property carrying values that are impaired at december   one or a combination of factors such as significantly lower future sales prices  significantly lower future production  significantly higher future costs  or significantly lower future margins for refining and marketing  could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to property basis differences and liabilities for repairs  dismantlements and retirement benefits 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h and pm in malaysia and certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 

table of contents legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating losses beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligation millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total in addition to the obligations as of december  as reflected in the above table  in early the company entered into a floating  production  storage and offloading fpso vessel lease and a dry tree unit construction contract associated with development of the kikeh field in block k malaysia 
total kikeh field development costs are expected to be billion 
in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods is shown below 
amount of commitment millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end involve an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract 
the processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
under the contract  the company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility 
if actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through is less than a specified quantity  the company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time 
the company has a contract to purchase hydrogen for the meraux refinery through the contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid 
future required minimum annual payments under both of these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
a strong global economy  political uncertainty in iraq and the middle east  and effective price management practices utilized by opec led to high oil prices during and early natural gas prices also were strong in and early  mainly due to the high price of crude oil and also because demand for the product often outstrips supply in the short term 
due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil prices and north american natural gas prices routine monitoring of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and provides for capital expenditures of billion 
of this amount  million or  is allocated for exploration and production 
geographically  of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the united states  including million for development of deepwater projects in the gulf of mexico  another is allocated to canada  including million for development of heavy oil fields and million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations  is allocated to exploration and development in malaysia  including million for field development at kikeh in block k  and the remaining is planned for other areas  including ecuador  the united kingdom and the republic of congo 
budgeted refining and marketing capital expenditures for are million  including million in north america and million in the united kingdom 
planned spending in north america includes funds to build additional gasoline stations at wal mart sites 
capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during 
table of contents the company currently does not anticipate a significant increase in long term borrowings during although murphy s budget includes a robust amount of capital spending  the company expects normal operating cash flows to be sufficient to cover planned spending 
it is possible that long term debt could increase significantly in  especially if cash flows are adversely affected in the near term by significantly weaker oil and natural gas sales prices and continued weak refining and marketing margins such as those experienced in early rising crude prices in early squeezed refining and marketing margins  this business was experiencing losses in early the company has made a significant oil discovery in block k offshore sabah  malaysia at a field named kikeh 
a field development plan  as approved by the company s board of directors and the malaysian authorities  calls for gross development costs of billion  which includes 
billion of lease costs for an fpso 
the company has an working interest in the field 
it is likely that a significant portion of the company s share of funding for field development in will come from borrowed capital 
first production from the kikeh field offshore sabah is estimated to occur in the second half of murphy s oil and natural gas production is expected to grow in production from the front runner deepwater gulf of mexico field will ramp up in and development drilling in western canada at seal should lead to higher heavy oil production 
the combination of higher front runner and seal production is expected to more than offset normal production declines elsewhere 
total production for is projected to average approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
due to a reduction in bond yields during  the company has reduced the primary plans discount rate from in to in although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tend to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns 
the effect of a lower discount rate and a growing employee population will lead to higher pension expense in the company s annual retirement plan expense is estimated to increase by about million for compared to in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
forward looking statements this form k report  including documents incorporated by reference here  contains statements of the company s expectations  intentions  plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the company s control 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the company s january  form k report on file with the us securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
murphy was a party to natural gas price swap agreements at december  for a remaining notional volume of million mmbtu that are intended to hedge the financial exposure of its meraux  louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the future price of a portion of natural gas to be purchased for fuel in and in each month of settlement  the swaps require murphy to pay an average natural gas price of per mmbtu and to receive the average nymex price for the final three trading days of the month 
at december   the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of million 
a increase in the average nymex price of natural gas would have increased this asset by million  while a decrease would have reduced the asset by a similar amount 
at december   the company was a party to forward sale contracts covering  barrels per day in heavy oil sales during and  barrels per day in the contracts are intended to hedge the financial exposure of the company s heavy oil sales in canada during the respective contract period and are priced at per barrel in and per barrel in at december   the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset valued at 
million 
a increase in the price of canadian heavy oil at the hardisty terminal in canada would have decreased this asset by million  while a decrease would have increased this asset by a similar amount
