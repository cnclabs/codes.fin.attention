contract manufacturing we utilize a portion of our excess manufacturing capacity to provide third party contract manufacturing 
we currently provide contract manufacturing for many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including pfizer  centocor  inc  santen incorporated and hoffman laroche inc 
many of the products that we contract manufacture are difficult to manufacture and  therefore  do not attract significant competition 
contract manufacturing as a percentage of total revenues equaled approximately for the year ended december  we believe contract manufacturing provides the following benefits a means of absorbing overhead costs and  as such  is an efficient utilization of excess capacity  and experience in manufacturing a broad line of formulations  which is advantageous to us in pursuing and integrating acquired products 
sales and marketing our commercial operations organization  which includes sales and marketing  is based in princeton  new jersey 
we have a national sales force consisting of approximately  approved positions 
we distribute our branded pharmaceutical products primarily through wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
these products are ordinarily dispensed to the public through pharmacies by prescription 
our marketing and sales promotions for branded pharmaceutical products principally target general family practitioners  internal medicine physicians  cardiologists  endocrinologists  neurologists  psychiatrists  pain specialists  sleep specialists and hospitals through detailing and sampling to encourage physicians to prescribe more of our products 
the sales force is supported and supplemented by co promotion arrangements  telemarketing and direct mail  as well as through advertising in trade publications and representation at regional and national medical conventions 
our telemarketing and direct mailing efforts are performed primarily by using a computer sampling system which we developed to distribute samples to physicians 
we identify and target physicians through data available from ims america  ltd 
and scott levin  suppliers of prescriber prescription data 
we intend to seek new markets in which to promote our product lines and will continue expansion of our field sales force as product growth  product acquisitions or product approvals warrant 
we seek new international markets for product lines for which we have international rights 
the marketing and distribution of these products in foreign countries generally require the prior registration of the products in those countries 
we generally seek to enter into distribution agreements with companies with established marketing and distribution capabilities to distribute the products in foreign countries since we do not have a distribution mechanism in place for distribution outside the united states and puerto rico 
similar to other pharmaceutical companies  our principal customers are wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
the wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has in recent years been subject to increasing consolidation  which has increased our  and other industry participants  customer concentration 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were attributable to three key wholesalers cardinal bindley  amerisource bergen corporation and mckesson corporation 
manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in bristol  tennessee  rochester  michigan  middleton  wisconsin  st 
petersburg  florida  and st 
louis  missouri 
these facilities have manufacturing  packaging  laboratory  office and warehouse space 
we are licensed by the drug enforcement agency  which we refer to as the dea  a division of the department of justice  to procure and produce controlled substances 
we manufacture certain of our own branded pharmaceutical products  as well as products owned by other pharmaceutical companies under manufacture and supply contracts 
we can produce a broad range of dosage formulations  including sterile solutions  lyophylized freeze dried products  injectables  tablets and capsules  creams and ointments  suppositories and powders 
we believe our manufacturing capabilities allow us to capture higher margins and pursue product line extensions more efficiently 
we manufacture a portion of the finished dosage form of altace at our bristol facility 
however  currently many of our product lines  including skelaxin  sonata  delestrogen  corgard  intal  tilade  synercid and cortisporin are manufactured for us by third parties 
as of december   capacity utilization was approximately at the bristol facility  approximately at the rochester facility  approximately at the middleton facility  approximately at the st 
petersburg facility and approximately at the st 
louis facility 
with the exception of the middleton and st 
petersburg facilities  we believe our facilities provide us with substantial manufacturing capacity for future growth 
thrombin jmi is the only product we manufacture at our middleton facility 
we are currently working to expand our capacity for thrombin jmi  a portion of such expansion should be completed in the fourth quarter of we intend to transfer  when advantageous  production of acquired branded pharmaceutical products and their product line extensions to our manufacturing facilities as soon as practicable after regulatory requirements and contract manufacturing requirements are satisfied 
in addition to manufacturing  we have fully integrated manufacturing support systems including quality assurance  quality control  regulatory compliance and logistics 
these support systems enable us to maintain high standards of quality for our products and simultaneously deliver reliable services and goods to our customers on a timely basis 
companies that do not have such support systems in house must outsource these services 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package drug products for us and for third parties with which we have contracted 
generally we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials and components from suppliers in the past 
currently  we rely on more than suppliers to deliver the necessary raw materials and components 
research and development with our acquisition of medco research on february   we established the foundation for our research and development capability 
today  king pharmaceuticals research and development is engaged in the development of chemical compounds  including new chemical entities  which provide us with strategic pipeline opportunities for the commercialization of new branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
in addition to developing new chemical compounds  we pursue means of enhancing the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that may provide additional benefits to patients and improvements in the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing processes 
we invest in research and development because we believe it is important to our long term growth 
we presently employ approximately people in research and development  which include pre clinical and toxicology experts  medical affairs personnel  statisticians and project managers 
in the conduct of our research and development  we utilize a project management model that provides us with substantial flexibility  with a goal of maximizing efficiency and minimizing internal fixed costs 
utilizing this model  we supplement our internal efforts by collaborating with independent research organizations  including educational institutions and research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and contracting with others for the performance of research in their facilities 
we use the services of physicians  hospitals  medical schools  universities  and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of new products 
we seek investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts 
these investments can take many forms  including in licensing arrangements  co development and co marketing agreements  joint ventures  and the acquisition of products in development 
drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
only a small percentage of chemical compounds discovered by researchers prove to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine 
the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes to years or longer 
drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process  and even late stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval 
our development projects involving currently marketed compounds include the following an altace diuretic combination product  and a new formulation of intal  for the long term management of asthma  utilizing the environmentally friendly propellant hfa 
other compounds in development include the following binodenoson  our next generation cardiac pharmacologic stress imaging agent  pt  an investigational new drug for the treatment of ed and fsd  t  an investigational drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain  and mre  an investigational drug for the topical treatment of chronic diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers 
we are party to a development and commercialization agreement with discovery therapeutics  inc predecessor to aderis pharmaceuticals dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of compounds that stimulate the aa subfamily of adenosine receptors  which we call aa agonists 
under the terms of that agreement  aderis granted us an exclusive license under certain us and foreign patents and pending applications relating to aa agonists 
we have exclusive rights under this license to market and sell developed compounds  either directly or through sublicense 
in exchange for these rights  we agreed to pay aderis licensing fees  development milestones and royalties on future sales of aa agonist products utilizing these compounds 
these compounds include binodenoson and mre which we currently have under development

biological drugs are subject to both the fdc act and the public health service act  which we refer to as the phs act  and related regulations 
biological drugs are licensed under the phs act 
at the federal level  we are principally regulated by the fda as well as by the dea  the consumer product safety commission  the federal trade commission  the us department of agriculture  the occupation safety and health administration  and the us environmental protection agency  which we refer to as the epa 
the fdc act  the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products and those manufactured by and for third parties 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
when we acquire the right to market an existing approved pharmaceutical product  both we and the former application holder are required to submit certain information to the fda 
this information  if adequate  results in the transfer to us of marketing rights to the pharmaceutical products 
we are also required to discuss with the fda any changes in certain conditions in the approved application as set forth in the fda s regulations 
our business strategy includes acquiring branded pharmaceutical products and transferring  when advantageous  their manufacture to our manufacturing facilities as soon as practicable after regulatory requirements are satisfied 
in order to transfer manufacturing of the acquired branded products  we must demonstrate  by filing information with the fda  that we can manufacture the product in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  which we refer to as cgmps  and the specifications and conditions of the approved marketing application 
for changes requiring prior approval  there can be no assurance that the fda will grant such approval in a timely manner  if at all 
the fda also mandates that drugs be manufactured  packaged and labeled in conformity with cgmps 
in complying with cgmp regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to ensure that the products meet applicable specifications and other requirements to ensure product safety and efficacy 
the fda periodically inspects drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cgmp requirements 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or recall of a product 
adverse experiences with the use of products must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval 
the federal government has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers including the authority to withdraw product approvals  commence actions to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmps  and to impose or seek injunctions  voluntary or involuntary recalls  and civil monetary and criminal penalties 
such a restriction or prohibition on sales or withdrawal of approval of products marketed by us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
marketing authority for our products is subject to revocation by the applicable governmental agencies 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products or changes in manufacturing locations are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals  which may or may not be received and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
our manufacturing facilities are continually subject to inspection by such governmental agencies  and manufacturing operations could be interrupted or halted in any such facilities if such inspections prove unsatisfactory 
we also manufacture and sell pharmaceutical products which are controlled substances as defined in the controlled substances act and related federal and state laws  which establish certain security  licensing  record keeping  reporting and personnel requirements administered by the dea and state authorities 
the dea has a dual mission of law enforcement and regulation 
the former deals with the illicit aspects of the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them 
the dea shares enforcement authority with the federal bureau of investigation  another division of the department of justice 
the dea s regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed manufacturers  distributors and dispensers of controlled substances  the substances themselves and the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent such articles from being diverted into illicit channels of commerce 
we maintain appropriate licenses and certificates with the applicable state authorities in order to engage in pharmaceutical development  manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products containing controlled substances 
we are licensed by the dea to manufacture and distribute certain pharmaceutical products containing controlled substances 
the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the prescription drug marketing act  which we refer to as pdma  a part of the fdc act  which regulates distribution activities at both the federal and state level 
under the pdma and its implementing regulations  states are permitted to require registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals even if these manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state 
states are also permitted to adopt regulations limiting the distribution of product samples to licensed practitioners 
the pdma also imposes extensive licensing  personnel record keeping  packaging  quantity  labeling  product handling and facility storage and security requirements intended to prevent the sale of pharmaceutical product samples or other diversions 
our rochester facility  manufactures both drug and biological pharmaceutical products 
prior to our acquisition of this facility in february  it was one of six pfizer facilities subject to a consent decree issued by the us district court of new jersey in august we plan to petition for relief from the consent decree with respect to the rochester facility when appropriate 
the rochester facility was inspected by the fda in november december during this inspection  the fda made cgmp observations in a written report provided to us 
this written report is known as an fda form or simply as a the observations in a are reported to the manufacturer in order to assist the manufacturer in complying with the fdc act and the regulations enforced by the fda 
often a pharmaceutical manufacturer receives a after an inspection 
while no law or regulation requires us to respond to a  we provided the fda with a written response to the related to the november december inspection of the rochester facility  including action plans to address the observations 
the from november december does not require us to delay or discontinue the production of any products made at the rochester facility 
we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or statutes or legal interpretation  when and if promulgated or enacted  may have on our business in the future 
new laws  regulations  standards  or interpretations could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping or expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
these changes  or new legislation  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters our operations are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities 
we believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with our permits and environmental laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with current environmental law will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or as a result of increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  which we refer to as cercla  the epa can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup of contaminated properties upon each or any of the current and former site owners  site operators or parties who sent waste to the site  regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity 
in addition  many states  including tennessee  michigan  wisconsin  florida and missouri  have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the epa 
we have entered into hazardous waste hauling agreements with licensed third parties to properly dispose of hazardous wastes 
we cannot assure you that we will not be found liable under cercla or other applicable state statutes or regulations for the costs of undertaking a clean up at a site to which our wastes were transported 
competition general we compete with other pharmaceutical companies for products and product line acquisitions 
competitors include biovail corporation  forest laboratories  inc  galen holdings  plc  shire pharmaceuticals group plc  medicis pharmaceutical corporation  watson pharmaceuticals  inc  and other companies which also acquire branded pharmaceutical products and product lines from other pharmaceutical companies 
additionally  since our products are generally established and commonly sold  they are subject to competition from products with similar qualities 
our branded pharmaceutical products may be subject to competition from alternate therapies during the period of patent protection and thereafter from generic equivalents 
the manufacturers of generic products typically do not bear the related research and development costs and consequently are able to offer such products at considerably lower prices than the branded equivalents 
there are  however  a number of factors  which enable products to remain profitable once patent protection has ceased 
these include the establishment of a strong brand image with the prescriber or the consumer  supported by the development of a broader range of alternative formulations than the manufacturers of generic products typically supply 
generic substitutes many of our branded pharmaceutical products have either a strong market niche or competitive position 
some of our branded pharmaceutical products face competition from generic substitutes 
for a manufacturer to launch a generic substitute  it must prove to the fda when filing an application to make a generic substitute that the branded pharmaceutical and the generic substitute have bioequivalence 
it typically takes two or three years to prove bioequivalence and receive fda approval for many generic substitutes 
by focusing our efforts in part on products with patent protection  challenging bioequivalence or complex manufacturing requirements  we are better able to maintain market share and produce sustainable  high margins and cash flows 
due to recent statutory changes  the fda may approve generic substitutes of our branded pharmaceutical products in a shorter period of time 
previously  the fda required that generic applicants claiming patent invalidity or non infringement give us notice each time either an abbreviated new drug application  which we refer to as an anda  was submitted or amended to claim invalidity or non infringement of newly listed patents 
if we filed a patent infringement suit against the generic applicant within days of receiving such notice  the fda was barred or stayed from approving the anda for months unless specific events occurred sooner 
to avoid multiple month stays for the same branded drug  the recent statutory changes modified the relevant provisions of the hatch waxman act usc j and to indicate that a month stay will only attach to patents that are listed in the fda s orange book at the time an anda is originally filed 
although the anda filer is still required to certify against a late listed patent  the nda holder can still bring suit based upon infringement of that patent  but such a suit will no longer trigger an additional month stay of fda approval of the anda 
as a result  generic substitutes of our branded pharmaceutical products could be approved sooner 
also  recent regulatory changes significantly alter patent listing requirements in the fda s orange book 
only patents listed in the fda s orange book are eligible for protection by a month stay 
we are now required to list all patents that claim a composition of matter relating to a drug or a method of using a drug 
previously  this provision was interpreted broadly  allowing the listing of many drug patents 
the fda s new regulations prohibit listing of certain types of patents  including patents claiming certain metabolites the active moiety that results from the body s metabolism of the drug substance  intermediates namely  substances not present in the finished product  certain methods of use  or patents claiming certain product packaging 
as such  some patents that may issue in the future may not be eligible for listing in the fda s orange book and thus not eligible for protection by a month stay 
intellectual property patents  licenses and proprietary rights we consider the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities important to our business 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including ours  are uncertain and involve legal and factual questions  which can be difficult to resolve 
we intend to seek patent protection in the united states and selected foreign countries where and when appropriate 
in connection with the altace product line  we acquired a license for the exclusive rights in the united states and puerto rico to various aventis patents  including the rights to the active ingredients in altace having patents listed in the fda orange book that expire in january  october and april our rights include the use of the active ingredients in altace generally in combination as human therapeutic or human diagnostic products in the united states 
for a discussion of challenges to our patents by generic drug manufacturers  please see the section entitled risk factors under the heading if we cannot successfully enforce our rights under the patents relating to two of our largest products  altace and skelaxin or if we are unable to secure or enforce our rights under other patents  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we also own us patents listed in the fda s orange book that expire in august for procanbid 
additionally  we own a us patent for thalitone  which is listed in the fda s orange book and expires in june skelaxin has two method of use patents listed in the fda s orange book  which do not expire until december for a discussion of challenges to our patents by generic drug manufacturers  please see the section entitled risk factors under the heading if we cannot successfully enforce our rights under the patents relating to two of our largest products  altace and skelaxin  or if we are unable to secure or enforce our rights under other patents  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
sonata has a composition of matter patent listed in the fda s orange book that extends through june in connection with our acquisition of the rights to intal  tilade  and synercid on december   we acquired associated intellectual property rights  including patent rights in the united states related to the hfa formulation of intal until september  a composition of matter patent in the united states for tilade until october and a formulation patent in the united states for synercid until november we have exclusive licenses expiring in june for the prescription formulations of neosporin and polysporin 
these licenses are subject to early termination in the event we fail to meet specified quality control standards  including cgmp regulations with respect to the products  or commit a material breach of other terms and conditions of the licenses which would have a significant adverse effect on the uses of the licensed products retained by the licensor  which would include among other things  marketing products under these trade names outside the prescription field 
in connection with the acquisition of lorabid  we acquired  among other things  all of eli lilly s rights in approximately patents and received a broad royalty free non exclusive license in the united states and puerto rico to other patents and associated technology 
we also received an exclusive sublicense to four other patents for which we must pay a royalty to eli lilly if certain sales thresholds are met 
lorabid has patent protection through in connection with the acquisition of meridian on january   we acquired the intellectual property rights associated with meridian s dual chambered auto injector and injection process  which has a patent that expires in april we receive royalties on sales of adenoscan  a product that we successfully developed 
adenoscan has patent coverage that extends to march in addition to the intellectual property for the currently marketed products described above  we also have acquired intellectual property related to various products currently under development 
for example  we own all issued patents on t and related backup compounds currently under development for the treatment for neuropathic pain 
in connection with our collaborative agreement with palatin technologies  inc  we have acquired a co exclusive license to intellectual property rights related to pt  currently being developed for the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction 
furthermore  in connection with the development of mre  we have acquired exclusive licenses to composition and method patents related to adenosine receptor agonists for the topical treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers 
also  we have acquired exclusive rights to patents related to binodenoson  the pharmacologic stress agent specific to the adenosine receptor necessary for increased cardiac blood flow 
we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and sustain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose the technology or that we can adequately protect our trade secrets 
trademarks we sell our branded products under a variety of trademarks 
we believe that we have valid proprietary interests in all currently used trademarks  including those for our principal branded pharmaceutical products registered in the united states 
backlog as of march   we had no material backlog 
employees as of february   we employed  full time and part time persons 
approximately employees of the rochester facility are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the paper  allied industrial  chemical energy workers  international union pace  local no 
 which expires on february  approximately employees of the st 
louis facility are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters  chauffeurs  warehousemen and helpers of america union  local no 
 which expires february  we believe our employee relations are good 
risk factors before you purchase our securities  you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report  including our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the adverse events described in this risk factors section or other sections of this report actually occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  the trading price  if any  of our securities could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business investigations by the sec and office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  other possible governmental investigations  and securities  derivative and erisa litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as previously reported  in march the sec initiated a formal investigation of king relating to  among other topics  sales of our products to vitarx and prison health services  our best price lists  the pricing of our pharmaceutical products provided to governmental medicaid agencies  the accrual and payment of rebates on the product altace  the products fluogen and lorabid  the king benevolent fund  inc  our calculations related to medicaid rebates  and the audit committee s internal review of issues raised by the sec investigation 
as also previously reported  on november   we received a subpoena duces tecum from the office of inspector general at the department of health and human services requesting the production of documents relating to some of the matters being investigated by the sec and to our sales  marketing and other business practices for altace  aplisol and levoxyl 
more recently  we have reviewed with the staff of the sec the circumstances giving rise to the restatement of previously issued financial statements as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our determination that we underpaid amounts due to medicaid and other government pricing programs from through  we have continued to engage in discussions with representatives of the us securities and exchange commission  the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  the department of justice  the national association of medicaid fraud control units  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the department of veterans affairs  the centers for medicare medicaid services  and the public health service 
our objective in these discussions has been to achieve a comprehensive settlement relating to all the matters being investigated by or discussed with all the governmental authorities 
we have not yet reached any agreements or understandings with respect to the terms of such a settlement  and we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to reach such an agreement 
based on the status of the discussions to date  however  we now believe that it is reasonably likely that we will be able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with all relevant governmental parties on the terms described in the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading governmental investigations and securities litigation 
our ability to achieve a settlement on these or other terms is subject to substantial uncertainties 
our discussions to date have been conducted with the staffs of various agencies and other governmental authorities 
we do not yet have any agreements or understandings with any of them 
even if we were to reach such an agreement or understanding with staff personnel  it would be subject to the approval of numerous more senior representatives of the governmental parties  including the members of the us securities and exchange commission  the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  senior officials in the departments of justice  health and human services and veterans affairs  and senior officials in most or all of the states 
we expect that our agreements with the various governmental parties will also require that the governmental parties reach numerous agreements among themselves  and that the consummation of our agreement with each governmental party would be dependent on consummation of our agreements with other governmental parties 
we also expect that some aspects of a comprehensive settlement would require court approval 
in light of these uncertainties  we stress that we may not be able to reach a settlement with the governmental parties  whether on the terms described above or at all 
as a result  the ultimate amount that we will actually have to pay to resolve these matters could be materially more than the amount accrued to date  and the terms could otherwise be materially less favorable than those described above 
because of these uncertainties and the complexity of completing a comprehensive resolution  we are not yet able to estimate with reasonable confidence the amount of time that will be required to enter into and consummate comprehensive settlement agreements 
the possible settlement described above would not apply to the related pending class actions and derivative suits or any other claims by private plaintiffs 
while we deny any liability  we are unable to predict the outcome of the class actions and derivative suits or reasonably estimate the range of loss  if any 
for additional information  please see this section entitled risk factors under the heading if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid rebate program or other governmental pricing programs  we could be subject to additional reimbursements  penalties  sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business  and the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading governmental investigations and securities litigation 
subsequent to the announcement of the sec investigation described above  beginning in march  purported class action complaints were filed by holders of our securities against us  our directors  former directors  our executive officers  former executive officers  a subsidiary  and a former director of the subsidiary in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  alleging violations of the securities act of and or the securities exchange act of these complaints have been consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee 
in addition  holders of our securities filed two class action complaints alleging violations of the securities act of in tennessee state court 
we removed these two cases to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  where these two cases were consolidated with the other class actions 
plaintiffs in these actions unsuccessfully moved to remand these two cases back to tennessee state court 
these two actions therefore remain part of the consolidated action 
the district court has appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action  and those lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on october  alleging that we  through some of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  and former directors  made false or misleading statements concerning our business  financial condition  and results of operations during periods beginning february  and continuing until march  plaintiffs in the consolidated action have also named the underwriters of our november public offering as defendants 
we and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
on august   the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee ruled on defendants motions to dismiss 
the court dismissed all claims as to jones pharma  inc  a predecessor to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  king research and development  inc  and as to defendants dennis jones and henry richards 
the court also dismissed certain claims as to five other individual defendants 
the court denied the motions to dismiss in all other respects 
following the court s ruling  on september   we and the other remaining defendants filed answers to plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint 
discovery and other proceedings in the case are continuing  and no trial date has been set 
seven purported shareholder derivative complaints have also been filed in federal and state courts in tennessee alleging a breach of fiduciary duty  among other things  by some of our officers and directors 
on october   all of the defendants named in this action filed an answer to the amended consolidated derivative and class action complaint 
discovery in this action has commenced 
no trial date has been set 
another purported class action complaint was filed on august  in tennessee state court against us and the members of our board of directors 
this new case largely asserts substantially the same claims and seeks the same relief as the class action claim that was recently added to the state derivative action described above 
defendants in that action filed a motion to dismiss on november   that motion is pending and no hearing date has been set 
additionally  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee under the employee retirement income security act  which we refer to as erisa 
as amended  the complaint alleges that we and certain of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  former directors and an employee violated fiduciary duties that they allegedly owed our k retirement savings plan s participants and beneficiaries under erisa 
the allegations underlying this action are similar in many respects to those in the class action litigation described above 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the erisa action on march  the district court judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation 
on december   the magistrate judge held a hearing on this motion  and  on december   he recommended that the district court judge dismiss the action 
the district court judge accepted the recommendation and dismissed the case on february  we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously but are unable currently to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any 
if any governmental sanctions are imposed  or if we were not to prevail in the pending litigation  neither of which we can predict or reasonably estimate at this time  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
responding to the governmental investigations  resolving the amounts owed to governmental agencies in connection with the underpayments and defending us in the pending litigation has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and the payment of additional professional fees 
if we cannot successfully enforce our rights under the patents relating to two of our largest products  altace and skelaxin  or if we are unable to secure or enforce our rights under other patents  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
cobalt pharmaceuticals  inc  a generic drug manufacturer located in mississauga  ontario  canada  filed an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of altace 
the following us patents are listed for altace in the fda s orange book united states patent nos 
 the patent  and  the patent  two composition of matter patents related to altace  and united states patent no 
 the patent  a method of use patent related to altace  with expiration dates of january  october  and april  respectively 
under the hatch waxman act  any generic manufacturer may file an anda with a certification  known as a paragraph iv certification  challenging the validity or infringement of a patent listed in the fda s orange book four years after the pioneer company obtains approval of its nda 
cobalt has filed a paragraph iv certification alleging invalidity of the patent  and we filed suit on march  in the district court for the district of massachusetts to enforce our rights under that patent 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of that suit provides us an automatic stay of fda approval of cobalt s anda for months from no earlier than february  in march  cobalt stipulated to infringement of the patent 
should the court find in favor of a cobalt summary judgment motion on the validity of the patent  we would not receive the full benefit of that month stay 
subsequent to filing our original complaint  we amended our complaint to add an allegation of infringement of the patent 
the patent covers one of altace s three indications for use 
in response to the amended complaint  cobalt informed the fda that it no longer seeks approval to market its proposed product for the indication covered by the patent 
on this basis  the court granted cobalt summary judgment of non infringement of the patent 
the court s decision does not affect cobalt s infringement of the patent 
we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under the and patents 
eon labs  inc  corepharma  llc and mutual pharmaceutical co  inc 
have each filed an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of skelaxin mg tablets 
additionally  eon labs anda seeks permission to market a generic version of skelaxin mg tablets 
united states patent nos 
 the patent and  the patent two method of use patents relating to skelaxin  are listed in the fda s orange book and do not expire until december  eon labs and corepharma have each filed paragraph iv certifications against the patent and the patent alleging noninfringement and invalidity of these patents 
mutual has filed a paragraph iv certification against the patent alleging noninfringement and invalidity of that patent 
we filed a patent infringement suit against eon labs on january  in the district court for the eastern district of new york  corepharma on march  in the district court for the district of new jersey subsequently transferred to the district court for the eastern district of new york  and mutual on march  in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania concerning their proposed mg products 
additionally  we filed a separate suit against eon labs on december   concerning its proposed mg product 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of the suit against corepharma provides us with an automatic stay of fda approval of corepharma s anda for months from no earlier than january  also pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of the suits against eon labs provides us with an automatic stay of fda approval of eon labs anda for its proposed mg and mg products for months from no earlier than november   and november   respectively 
we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under the and patents to the full extent of the law 
on march   we received a copy of a letter from the fda to all anda applicants for skelaxin stating that the use listed in the fda s orange book for the patent may be deleted from the anda applicants product labeling 
we believe that this decision is arbitrary  capricious  and inconsistent with the fda s previous position on this issue 
we filed a citizen petition on march  supplemented on april  and on july   requesting the fda to rescind that letter  require generic applicants to submit paragraph iv certifications for the patent  and prohibit the removal of information corresponding to the use listed in the orange book 
king concurrently filed a petition for stay of action requesting the fda to stay approval of any generic metaxalone products until the fda has fully evaluated our citizen petition 
on march   the fda sent a letter to us explaining that our proposed labeling revision  which includes references to additional clinical studies relating to food  age  and gender effects  was approvable and only required certain formatting changes 
on april   we submitted amended labeling text that incorporated those changes 
on april   mutual filed a petition for stay of action requesting the fda to stay approval of our proposed labeling revision until the fda has fully evaluated and ruled upon our citizen petition  as well as all comments submitted in response to that petition 
discussions with the fda concerning appropriate labeling are ongoing 
corepharma  mutual and we have filed responses and supplements to the pending citizen petition 
if our citizen petition is rejected  there is a substantial likelihood that a generic version of skelaxin will enter the market  and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for other of our products or for products and technologies we develop or license 
in addition  our competitors may develop products  including generic products  similar to ours using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property protection  which could reduce our sales 
we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation in order to maintain our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and technology  or that we can adequately protect our trade secrets and technology 
if we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to the risk of additional litigation and regulatory proceedings or actions in connection with the restatement of prior period financial statements 
we have restated our previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years and  including interim periods in  and the first two quarters of we may in the future be subject to class action suits  other litigation or regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation to the restatement of our prior period financial statements 
any expenses incurred in connection with this potential litigation or regulatory proceeding or action not covered by available insurance or any adverse resolution of this potential litigation or regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
further  any litigation or regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming  and it may distract our management from the conduct of our business 
management has concluded that we did not have a sufficient number of finance and accounting resources performing supervisory review and monitoring activities as of year end and  accordingly  that we did not maintain effective controls over the period end financial reporting process 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate this material weakness and conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of or that the material weakness will not result in material misstatements of our financial statements 
under the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules issued thereunder  management is required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of each year end 
the company is also required to include in its annual reports on form k a report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our registered public accounting firm also issues an audit report on management s assessment and our internal controls over financial reporting 
as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have restated our previously issued financial statements for the years and  including interim periods in  and the first two quarters of  primarily to reflect the correction of methodological errors related to our reserve for product returns 
the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standards provide that a restatement is a strong indicator of a material weakness 
considering this guidance  we evaluated the methodological errors that resulted in the restatement and concluded that the restatement resulted from a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of september  management has concluded that the material weakness that existed as of the end of the third quarter of has been remediated 
management has also concluded that  as a result of the loss of certain finance personnel  the challenges of hiring new personnel while a merger was pending and the resource requirements to address the restatement of our financial statements  we did not have a sufficient number of finance and accounting resources performing supervisory review and monitoring activities 
we are in the process of addressing this material weakness by actively recruiting additional managerial level finance and accounting resources 
although this material weakness as of year end did not result in any audit adjustments or material misstatements of our financial statements as of year end  it did result in certain errors during that were not detected by the period end monitoring activities 
we cannot assure you that management will not identify one or more additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during  that the steps we take to address any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses will be successful  that a significant deficiency or material weakness will not result in material errors before it is remediated  that management will be able to complete its assessment of internal control over financial reporting in a timely fashion in  or that management will be able to conclude on the basis of its evaluation that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of if sales of our major products or royalty payments to us decrease  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
altace  skelaxin  thrombin jmi  sonata  levoxyl and royalty revenues for the last twelve months ended december  accounted for     and of our total revenues from continuing operations  respectively  or in total 
we believe that these sources of revenue may constitute a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting sales of any of these products or products for which we receive royalty payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
although we have an obligation to indemnify our officers and directors  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage available for this purpose and may be forced to pay these indemnification costs directly and we may not be able to maintain existing levels of coverage  which could make it difficult to attract or retain qualified directors and officers 
our charter and bylaws require that we indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent provided by applicable tennessee law 
although we have purchased liability insurance for our directors and officers to fund such obligations  if our insurance carrier should deny coverage  or if the indemnification costs exceed the insurance coverage  we would be forced to bear some or all of these indemnification costs directly  which could be substantial and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if the cost of this insurance continues to increase significantly  or if this insurance becomes unavailable  we may not be able to maintain or increase our levels of insurance coverage for our directors and officers  which could make it difficult to attract or retain qualified directors and officers 
we are required annually  or on an interim basis as needed  to review the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill for impairment 
if events such as generic competition or inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient supply of product occur that cause the sales of our products to decline  the intangible asset value of any declining product could become impaired 
as of december   we had billion of net intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets primarily include the net book value of various product rights  trademarks  patents and other intangible rights 
if future sales of a product decline significantly  it could result in an impairment of the declining product s net book value  resulting in a non cash impairment charge 
demand for some of our non key products  including intal  tilade and corzide  declined over the past year at a rate which triggered a review of the intangible assets associated with these products 
the net intangible assets associated with these three products totals approximately million 
any impairment of the net book value of any product or combination of products  depending on the size of the product or products  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
if we cannot implement our strategy to grow our business through increased sales  acquisitions  development and in licensing  our business or competitive position in the pharmaceutical industry may suffer 
our current strategy is focused on increasing sales of our existing products and enhancing our competitive standing through acquisitions or in licensing of products in development and fda approved products  that complement our business and enable us to promote and sell new products through existing marketing and distribution channels 
moreover  since we engage in limited proprietary research activity with respect to the development of new chemical entities  we rely heavily on purchasing or licensing products in development and fda approved products from other companies 
we are engaged in the development and licensing of new products 
for example  we are engaged in the development of binodenoson  a myocardial pharmacologic stress imaging agent  engaged in the development of pt  an investigational new drug for the treatment of ed and fsd  engaged in the development of t  an investigational drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain  engaged in the development of mre  an investigational drug for the topical treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers  engaged in the development of a new inhaler for intal using the alternative propellant hfa for which the fda has issued an approvable letter  engaged in the development of an altace diuretic combination product  and engaged in the development of a diazepam filled auto injector 
we compete with other pharmaceutical companies  including large pharmaceutical companies with financial resources and capabilities substantially greater than ours  in the development and licensing of new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to engage in product life cycle management to develop new indications and line extensions for existing and acquired products  successfully develop  license or successfully commercialize new products on a timely basis or at all  develop or license new products already in development in a cost effective manner  or obtain any fda approvals necessary to successfully implement the strategies described above 
if we are not successful in the development or licensing of new products already in development  including the failure to obtain any necessary fda approval  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
further  other companies may license or develop products or may acquire technologies for the development of products that are the same as or similar to the products we have in development or that we license 
because there is rapid technological change in the industry and because many other companies may have more financial resources than we do  other companies may develop or license their products more rapidly than we can  complete any applicable regulatory approval process sooner than we can  market or license their products before we can market or license our products  or offer their newly developed or licensed products at prices lower than our prices  and thereby have a negative impact on the sales of our newly developed or licensed products 
the inability to effect acquisitions or licenses of additional branded products in development and fda approved products could limit the overall growth of our business 
furthermore  even if we obtain rights to a pharmaceutical product or acquire a company  we may not be able to generate sales sufficient to create a profit or otherwise avoid a loss 
technological developments or the fda s approval of new products or of new therapeutic indications for existing products may make our existing products or those products we are licensing or developing obsolete or may make them more difficult to market successfully  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we cannot integrate the business of companies or products we acquire  our business may suffer 
the integration of acquisitions into our business requires significant management attention and may require the further expansion of our sales force 
in order to manage our acquisitions effectively  we must maintain adequate operational  financial and management information systems and motivate and effectively manage an increasing number of employees 
our acquisitions have significantly expanded our product offerings  operations and number of employees 
our future success will also depend in part on our ability to retain or hire qualified employees to operate our expanding facilities efficiently in accordance with applicable regulatory standards 
if we cannot integrate our acquisitions successfully  these changes and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not have proprietary protection for most of our branded pharmaceutical products  and our sales could suffer from competition by generic substitutes 
although most of our revenue is generated by products not subject to competition from generic products  there is no proprietary protection for most of our branded pharmaceutical products  and generic substitutes for many of these products are sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
even our products that currently have no generic substitute could face generic competition if generics are developed by other companies and approved by the fda 
the entry of generic substitutes for any of our products could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  governmental and other pressure to reduce pharmaceutical costs may result in physicians prescribing products for which there are generic substitutes 
also  our branded products for which there is no generic form available may face competition from different therapeutic agents used for the same indications for which our branded products are used 
increased competition from the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or from different therapeutic agents used for the same indications for which our branded products are used may cause a decrease in revenue from our branded products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
on june   the fda approved the sndas filed by alara and jerome under b of the fdc act  usc et seq 
seeking to market their currently approved products levo t and unithroid  respectively as bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent ie  ab rated to our levoxyl 
on july   the fda approved an sanda filed by mylan under usc j  seeking to market mylan s currently approved levothyroxine sodium tablets as ab rated to levoxyl 
due to the availability of levothyroxine sodium products that are ab rated to levoxyl in the marketplace  net sales of levoxyl are likely to continue to decline 
this decline could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
due to recent statutory changes  the fda may approve generic substitutes of branded pharmaceutical products in a shorter period of time 
previously  the fda required that generic applicants claiming patent invalidity or non infringement give us notice each time either an anda was submitted or amended to claim invalidity or non infringement of newly listed patents 
if we filed a patent infringement suit against the generic applicant within days of receiving such notice  the fda was barred or stayed from approving the anda for months unless specific events occurred sooner 
to avoid multiple month stays for the same branded drug  the recent statutory changes modified the relevant provisions of the hatch waxman act usc j and to indicate that a month stay will only attach to patents that are listed in the fda s orange book at the time an anda is originally filed 
although the anda filer is still required to certify against a late listed patent  the nda holder can still bring suit based upon infringement of that patent 
such a suit will no longer trigger an additional month stay of fda approval of the anda 
as a result  generic substitutes of our branded pharmaceutical products could be approved sooner 
also  recent regulatory changes significantly alter patent listing requirements in the fda s orange book 
only patents listed in the fda s orange book are eligible for protection by a month stay 
we are now required to list all patents that claim a composition of matter relating to a drug or a method of using a drug 
previously  this provision was interpreted broadly  allowing the listing of many drug patents 
the fda s new regulations prohibit listing of certain types of patents  including patents claiming certain metabolites the active moiety that results from the body s metabolism of the drug substance  intermediates namely  substances not present in the finished product  certain methods of use  or patents claiming certain product packaging 
as such  some patents that may issue in the future may not be eligible for listing in the fda s orange book and thus not eligible for protection by a month stay 
if we cannot sell our products in amounts greater than our minimum purchase requirements under some of our supply agreements or sell our products in accordance with our forecasts  our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
some of our supply agreements or purchase orders  including those related to altace and skelaxin  require us to purchase certain minimum levels of active ingredients or finished goods 
if we are unable to maintain market exclusivity for our products  if our product life cycle management is not successful  if we fail to sell our products in accordance with the forecasts we develop as required by our supply agreements or if we do not terminate supply agreements at optimal times for us  we may incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreements or purchase orders 
in the event we incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreements or purchase orders  there may be a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and cash flows 
additionally we purchase raw materials and some of our finished goods based on our forecast for sales of our products 
we also manufacture many of our finished goods on these forecasts 
if we do not meet expected forecasts for sales  we could purchase inventory quantities in excess of expected demand 
this purchase of excess inventory could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
any significant delays or difficulties in the manufacture of or supply of materials for our products may reduce our profit margins and revenues  limit the sales of our products  or harm our products reputations 
we manufacture many of our products in facilities we own and operate 
these products include altace  levoxyl and thrombin jmi  which together represent approximately of our revenues for the last twelve months ended december  many of our production processes are complex and require specialized and expensive equipment 
any unforeseen delays or interruptions in our manufacturing operations may reduce our profit margins and revenues 
if we are unable to resume manufacturing  after interruption  we may not be able to distribute our products as planned 
furthermore  growing demand for our products could exceed our ability to supply the demand 
if such situations occur  it may be necessary for us to seek alternative manufacturers which could adversely impact our ability to produce and distribute our products 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to utilize third party manufacturers for our products in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  our manufacturing output may decline as a result of power outages  supply shortages  accidents  natural disasters or other disruptions of the manufacturing process 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies 
a portion or all of many of our product lines  including altace  skelaxin  sonata  intal  tilade  synercid and cortisporin  are currently manufactured by third parties 
our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely impact our profit margins or may result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control 
for example  if any of these third parties are not in compliance with applicable regulations  the manufacture of our products could be adversely affected 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute our products as planned 
if we encounter delays or difficulties with contract manufacturers in producing or packaging our products  the distribution  marketing and subsequent sales of these products would be adversely affected  and we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or abandon or sell product lines on unsatisfactory terms 
we might not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
we also cannot assure you that the manufacturers we utilize will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
we have begun construction of facilities to produce bicillin at our rochester facility 
the third party manufacturer that produced bicillin for us recently closed its plant 
if our inventory of bicillin is not sufficient to sustain demand during the period we are constructing our bicillin manufacturing facility  or if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory authorizations or experience production difficulties at our bicillin manufacturing facility  sales of this product may be reduced or the market for the product may be permanently diminished  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for the last twelve months ended december   net sales of bicillin were million representing of total revenues 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for us and for third parties with which we have contracted 
currently  we rely on over suppliers to deliver the necessary raw materials and components 
some of the contracts we have for the supply of raw materials have short terms  and there is no assurance that we will be able to secure extension of the terms of such agreements 
however  if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to distribute our products as planned 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in significant backorders for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and could adversely affect our market share for the products and the reputation of our products 
if third party developers of some of our new product candidates and reformulated products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns  or if their performance is substandard or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of their agreements with us  the introduction of new or reformulated products may not be successful 
we develop products and product line extensions through research and development and through contractual relationships with third parties that develop new products  including new product formulations  on our behalf 
our reliance on third parties for the development of some of our products exposes us to risks which could cause delays in the development of new products or reformulated products or could cause other problems beyond our control 
these third party developers may not be successful in developing the products or product line extensions for us  may face financial or business related difficulties which could make it difficult or impossible for them to continue business operations  or may otherwise breach or terminate their agreements with us 
if any of these events occur and we are unable to successfully develop these products and new product formulations by other means  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our rochester facility has been the subject of fda concerns 
if we cannot adequately address the fda s concerns  we may be unable to operate the rochester facility and  accordingly  our business may suffer 
our rochester facility manufactures both drug and biological pharmaceutical products 
the rochester facility was one of six pfizer facilities subject to a consent decree issued by the us district court of new jersey in august as a result of fda concerns about compliance issues within pfizer facilities in the period before the decree was entered 
the rochester facility continues to be subject to the consent decree 
the rochester facility was inspected by the fda in november december when an fda inspector completes an authorized inspection of a manufacturing facility  the inspector typically provides the owner operator of the facility with a written report listing the inspector s observations of objectionable conditions and practices 
this written report is known as an fda form or simply as a the observations in a are reported to the manufacturer in order to assist the manufacturer in complying with the fdc act and the regulations enforced by the fda 
often a pharmaceutical manufacturer receives a after an inspection and our rochester facility received a following the november december inspection 
while no law or regulation requires us to respond to a  we have submitted a written response detailing our plan of action with respect to each of the observations made on the and our commitment to correct any objectionable practice or condition 
the risk to us of a  if left uncorrected  could include  among other things  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the commencement of actions to seize or prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  or the cessation of manufacturing operations at the rochester facility that are not in compliance with cgmps 
while we believe the receipt of the will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  we cannot assure you that future inspections may not result in adverse regulatory actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are near maximum capacity at our middleton facility which limits our ability to increase production of thrombin jmi 
we are currently working to expand our production capacity for thrombin jmi 
we cannot assure you that our plans to expand our production capacity for thrombin jmi will be successful and or timely 
if we cannot successfully and timely expand our production capacity for thrombin jmi  our ability to increase production of thrombin jmi will be limited  thereby limiting our unit sales growth for this product 
wholesaler and distributor buying patterns and other factors may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate  and these fluctuations may adversely affect our profitability 
our results of operations  including  in particular  product sales revenue  may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors 
wholesalers and distributors represent a substantial portion of our sales 
buying patterns of our wholesalers and distributors may vary from time to time 
in the event wholesalers and distributors with whom we do business determine to limit their purchases of our inventory  sales of our products could be adversely affected 
for example  in advance of an anticipated price increase  many of our customers may order pharmaceutical products in larger than normal quantities 
the ordering of excess quantities in any quarter could cause sales of some of our branded pharmaceutical products to be lower in subsequent quarters than they would have been otherwise 
as part of our ongoing efforts to facilitate improved management of wholesale inventory levels of our branded pharmaceutical products  we entered into inventory management agreements with each of our three key wholesale customers during the second quarter of to a great extent  we rely on the accuracy of the data that each customer provides to us on a regular basis 
other factors that may affect quarterly results include expenditures related to the acquisition  sale and promotion of pharmaceutical products  a changing customer base  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  new products introduced by us or our competitors  the mix of products we sell  sales and marketing expenditures  product recalls  competitive pricing pressures and general economic and industry conditions that may affect customer demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
the insolvency of any of our principal customers  wholesale pharmaceutical distributors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
similar to other pharmaceutical companies  our principal customers are primarily wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
the wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has in recent years been subject to increasing consolidation  which has increased our  and other industry participants  customer concentration 
accordingly  three key customers account for approximately of our revenues and a significant portion of our accounts receivable 
the insolvency of any of our principal customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our wholly owned subsidiary  king research and development  successor to jones pharma incorporated  is a defendant in litigation which is currently being handled by its insurance carriers 
should this coverage be inadequate or subsequently denied or were we to lose some of these lawsuits  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our wholly owned subsidiary  king research and development  successor to jones pharma incorporated  is a defendant in multi defendant lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine and phentermine  which is usually referred to as fen phen 
in  jones acted as a distributor of obenix  a branded phentermine product 
jones also distributed a generic phentermine product 
we believe that jones phentermine products have been identified in less than of the foregoing cases 
the plaintiffs in these cases claim injury as a result of ingesting a combination of these weight loss drugs 
they seek compensatory and punitive damages as well as medical care and court supervised medical monitoring 
the plaintiffs claim liability based on a variety of theories including but not limited to  product liability  strict liability  negligence  breach of warranties and misrepresentation 
these suits are filed in various jurisdictions throughout the united states  and in each of these suits king research and development is one of many defendants  including manufacturers and other distributors of these drugs 
king research and development denies any liability incident to the distribution of jones phentermine products and intends to pursue all defenses available to it 
king research and development has tendered defense of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers for handling and they are currently defending king research and development in these suits 
in the event that insurance coverage is inadequate to satisfy any resulting liability  king research and development will have to resume defense of these lawsuits and be responsible for the damages  if any  that are awarded against it 
sales of thrombin jmi may be affected by the perception of risks associated with some of the raw materials used in its manufacture  if we are unable to successfully develop purification procedures at our facilities that are in accordance with the fda s expectations for biological products generally  the fda could limit our ability to manufacture biological products at those facilities 
the source material for our product thrombin jmi comes from bovine plasma and lung tissue which has been certified by the united states department of agriculture for use in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products 
bovine sourced materials  particularly those from outside the united states  may be of some concern because of potential transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or bse 
however  we have taken precautions to minimize the risks of contamination from bse in our source materials 
our principal precaution is the use of bovine materials only from fda approved sources in the united states 
accordingly  all source animals used in our production of thrombin jmi are of united states origin 
additionally  source animals used in production of thrombin jmi are generally less than months of age 
bse has not been identified in animals less than months of age 
we have two approved vendors as sources of supply of the bovine raw materials 
any interruption or delay in the supply of these materials could adversely affect the sales of thrombin jmi 
in addition to other actions taken by us and our vendor to minimize the risk of bse  we are developing steps to further purify the material of other potential contaminants 
we will continue surveillance of the source and believe that the risk of bse contamination in the source materials for thrombin jmi is very low 
while we believe that our procedures and those of our vendor for the supply  testing and handling of the bovine material comply with all federal  state  and local regulations  we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials 
there are high levels of global public concern about bse 
physicians could determine not to administer thrombin jmi because of the perceived risk which could adversely affect our sales of the product 
any injuries resulting from bse contamination could expose us to extensive liability 
also there is currently no alternative to the bovine sourced materials for thrombin jmi 
if public concern for the risk of bse infection in the united states should increase  the manufacture and sale of thrombin jmi and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
the fda expects manufacturers of biological products to have validated processes capable of removing extraneous viral contaminants to a high level of assurance 
as a result  many manufacturers of biologics are currently engaged in developing procedures to remove potential extraneous viral contaminants from their products 
we are in the process of developing appropriate processing steps to achieve maximum assurance for the removal of potential extraneous viral contaminants from thrombin jmi  which does not include bse because it is not a viral contaminant 
if we are not successful in gaining fda approval for these processes  our ability to manufacture thrombin jmi may be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
failure to obtain the fda s approval for these procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
on november   we may be required to repurchase our convertible debentures due november  during the fourth quarter of we issued convertible debentures due november  in an aggregate amount of million 
the price at which the debentures are convertible into common stock is  subject to adjustments spelled out in the documents governing the debentures 
if the price of our stock has not reached that amount by november   we may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the debentures representing the million on november  if some or all of the holders of the debentures request that we repurchase their debentures 
we cannot assure you that a significant repurchase requirement at that time would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a failure by dey  lp to successfully market the epipen auto injector or an increase in competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
dey  lp markets our epipen auto injector through a supply agreement with us that expires on december  under the terms of the agreement  we grant dey the exclusive right and license to market  distribute and sell epipen worldwide 
we understand that a new competitive product manufactured by hollister stier laboratories llc received fda approval over one year ago but has yet to enter the market 
the new product  twinject auto injector epinephrine injection  is not a therapeutically equivalent product but has the same indications  same usage and the same route of delivery as epipen 
users of epipen would have to obtain a new prescription in order to substitute twinject 
the supply agreement with dey includes minimum purchase requirements that are less than dey s purchases in recent years 
a failure by dey to successfully market and distribute epipen or an increase in competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our relationship with the dod and other government entities is subject to risks associated with doing business with the government 
all us government contracts provide that they may be terminated for the convenience of the government as well as for default 
our meridian medical technologies segment has pharmaceutical products that are presently sold primarily to the dod under an industrial base maintenance contract which we refer to as ibmc 
the current ibmc expires in september although we have reason to believe the dod will renew the ibmc based on our relationship over many years  we cannot assure you that they will 
in the event the dod does not renew the ibmc  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  the unexpected termination of one or more of our significant government contracts could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a surge capability provision allows for the coverage of defense mobilization requirements in the event of rapid military deployment 
if this surge capability provision becomes operative  we may be required to devote more of our meridian medical technologies segment manufacturing capacity to the production of products for the government which could result in less manufacturing capacity being devoted to products in this segment with higher profit margins 
our supply contracts with the dod are subject to post award audit and potential price determination 
these audits may include a review of our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
therefore  a post award audit or price redetermination could result in an adjustment to our revenues 
from time to time the dod makes claims for pricing adjustments with respect to completed contracts 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
other risks involved in government sales include the unpredictability in funding for various government programs and the risks associated with changes in procurement policies and priorities 
reductions in defense budgets may result in reductions in our revenues 
we also provide our nerve agent antidote auto injectors to a number of state agencies and local communities for homeland defense against chemical agent terrorist attacks 
changes in governmental and agency procurement policies and priorities may also result in a reduction in government funding for programs involving our auto injectors 
a significant loss in government funding of these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid rebate program or other governmental pricing programs  we could be subject to additional reimbursements  penalties  sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
medicaid reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and in certain respects ambiguous 
if we fail to comply with these obligations  we could be subject to additional reimbursements  penalties  sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as discussed in this risk factors section under the heading investigations by the sec and office of inspector general at the department of health and human services  other possible governmental investigations  and securities and erisa litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  and elsewhere in this report  we have determined that we underpaid amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to we have previously accrued million in respect of our estimated underpayments to medicaid and other government pricing programs and estimated settlement costs with all relevant governmental parties 
our ability to achieve a settlement on these or other terms is subject to substantial uncertainties 
we have implemented a new information technology system that is intended to significantly enhance the accuracy of our calculations for estimating amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  however  our processes for these calculations and the judgments involved in making these calculations will continue to involve subjective decisions and manual input  and  as a result  these calculations will remain subject to the risk of errors 
our co promotion agreement for altace with wyeth could be terminated before we realize all of the benefits of the agreement  it could be assigned to another company by wyeth  or wyeth could market a competing product 
our exclusive co promotion agreement for altace with wyeth could  under some circumstances  be terminated before we realize all of the benefits of the agreement 
if the co promotion agreement is terminated for any reason  we may not realize increased sales which we believe may result from the expanded promotion of altace 
if we must unwind our marketing alliance efforts  there may be a material adverse effect on the sales of altace 
when feasible  wyeth must give us six months written notice of its intent to sell  market or distribute any product competitive with altace 
once we have been notified in writing of wyeth s intent to market  sell or distribute a competing product  wyeth has days to inform us as to whether it intends to divest its interest in the competing product 
if wyeth elects not to divest the competing product or fails to divest the product within one year of providing notice to us of its plan to divest the competing product  then both of us must attempt to establish acceptable terms under which we would co promote the competing product for the remaining term of the co promotion agreement 
alternatively  we and wyeth could agree upon another commercial relationship 
if we and wyeth are unable to establish acceptable terms  then we have the option at our discretion to reacquire all the marketing rights to altace and terminate the co promotion agreement upon days prior written notice to wyeth 
in the event we decided to reacquire all the marketing rights to altace we would be obligated to pay wyeth an amount of cash equal to twice the net sales of altace in the united states for the month period preceding the reacquisition 
if we are unable to obtain approval of new hfa propellants for intal and tilade  our sales of these products could be adversely affected 
under government regulations  chlorofluorocarbon compounds are being phased out because of environmental concerns 
our products intal and tilade currently use these compounds as propellants 
the fda has issued an approvable letter with respect to the nda covering a new inhaler for intal using the alternative propellant hfa 
the approvable letter provides that final approval of the nda for intal hfa is subject to addressing certain fda comments solely pertaining to the chemistry  manufacturing  and controls section of the nda covering the product 
in the event we cannot also obtain final approval for alternative propellants for intal and tilade before the final phase out date of chlorofluorocarbon compounds or if we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of chlorofluorocarbon compounds for the production of these products prior to this date  our ability to market these products could be materially adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if the operations of our centralized distribution facility were interrupted  our business could be harmed 
for efficiency purposes  we rely on one centralized distribution facility which is located in bristol  tennessee 
an interruption in operations at this facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
the loss of our key personnel or an inability to attract new personnel could harm our business 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management staff  the loss of whose services might impede the achievement of our strategic objectives 
in connection with our review of our internal control over financial reporting  we concluded that as of december   we did not maintain effective controls over the period end financial reporting process because we did not have a sufficient number of finance and accounting resources performing supervisory review and monitoring activities as a result of the loss of certain finance personnel  the challenges of hiring new personnel while a merger was pending and the resource requirements to address the restatement of our financial statements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel in sufficient numbers  with the requisite skills or on acceptable terms necessary or advisable to support growth and integration 
the loss of the services of key personnel or the failure to attract such personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
our shareholder rights plan  charter and bylaws discourage unsolicited takeover proposals and could prevent shareholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
we have a shareholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group which attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors  and special voting requirements for the amendment of our charter and bylaws 
we are also subject to anti takeover provisions under tennessee laws  each of which could delay or prevent a change of control 
together these provisions and the rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for common stock 
our stock price is volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
the stock market in general and the market for emerging pharmaceutical companies  such as king in particular  have experienced extreme volatility 
many factors contribute to this volatility  including variations in our results of operations  perceived risks and uncertainties concerning our business  announcements of earnings  developments in the governmental investigations or securities litigation  failure to meet or exceed our own projections for revenue  product sales and earnings per share  failure to meet timelines for product development or other projections or forward looking statements we may make to the public  failure to meet or exceed security analysts financial projections for our company  comments or recommendations made by securities analysts  general market conditions  perceptions about market conditions in the pharmaceutical industry  announcements of technological innovations or the results of clinical trials or studies  changes in marketing  product pricing and sales strategies or development of new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory approval processes  and announcements concerning regulatory compliance and government agency reviews 
this volatility may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
moreover  the possibility exists that the stock market and in particular the securities of emerging pharmaceutical companies such as king could experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to operating performance 
the volatility of our common stock imposes a greater risk of capital losses on our shareholders than would a less volatile stock 
in addition  such volatility makes it difficult to ascribe a stable valuation to a shareholder s holdings of our common stock 
risks related to our industry failure to comply with laws and government regulations could affect our ability to operate our business 
virtually all aspects of our activities are regulated by federal and state statutes and government agencies 
the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  distribution and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from these activities  are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  including the fda  the dea  the federal trade commission  the consumer product safety commission  the us department of agriculture  the occupational safety and health administration  and the epa  as well as by foreign governments in countries where we distribute some of our products 
noncompliance with applicable fda policies or requirements could subject us to enforcement actions  such as suspensions of manufacturing or distribution  seizure of products  product recalls  fines  criminal penalties  injunctions  failure to approve pending drug product applications or withdrawal of product marketing approvals 
similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies  such as the dea  the epa or various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are manufactured  sold or distributed  and could have ramifications for our contracts with government agencies such as the veteran s administration or the department of defense 
these enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
all manufacturers of human pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act  or the phs act or both 
new drugs  as defined in the fdc act  and new human biological drugs  as defined in the phs act  must be the subject of an fda approved new drug or biologic license application before they may be marketed in the united states 
some prescription and other drugs are not the subject of an approved marketing application but  rather  are marketed subject to the fda s regulatory discretion and or enforcement policies 
any change in the fda s enforcement discretion and or policies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manufacture some pharmaceutical products containing controlled substances and  therefore  are also subject to statutes and regulations enforced by the dea and similar state agencies which impose security  record keeping  reporting and personnel requirements on us 
additionally  we manufacture biological drug products for human use and are subject to regulatory burdens as a result of these aspects of our business 
there are additional fda and other regulatory policies and requirements covering issues such as advertising  commercially distributing  selling  sampling and reporting adverse events associated with our products with which we must continuously comply 
noncompliance with any of these policies or requirements could result in enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the fda has the authority and discretion to withdraw existing marketing approvals and to review the regulatory status of marketed products at any time 
for example  the fda may require an approved marketing application for any drug product marketed if new information reveals questions about a drug s safety or efficacy 
all drugs must be manufactured in conformity with cgmps  and drug products subject to an approved application must be manufactured  processed  packaged  held and labeled in accordance with information contained in the approved application 
while we believe that all of our currently marketed pharmaceutical products comply with fda enforcement policies  have approval pending or have received the requisite agency approvals  our marketing is subject to challenge by the fda at any time 
through various enforcement mechanisms  the fda can ensure that noncomplying drugs are no longer marketed and that advertising and marketing materials and campaigns are in compliance with fda regulations 
in addition  modifications  enhancements  or changes in manufacturing sites of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be received and which may be subject to a lengthy fda review process 
our manufacturing facilities and those of our third party manufacturers are continually subject to inspection by governmental agencies 
manufacturing operations could be interrupted or halted in any of those facilities if a government or regulatory authority is unsatisfied with the results of an inspection 
any interruptions of this type could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations  enforcement positions  statutes or legal interpretations  when and if promulgated  adopted or enacted  may have on our business in the future 
these changes could  among other things  require modifications to our manufacturing methods or facilities  expanded or different labeling  new approvals  the recall  replacement or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
these changes  or new legislation  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
an increase in product liability claims or product recalls could harm our business 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our technologies or products are alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
these risks exist for products in clinical development and with respect to products that have regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while we have taken  and will continue to take  what we believe are appropriate precautions  we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of million for aggregate annual claims including a million self insured retention  however  we cannot assure you that the level or breadth of any insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover fully all potential claims 
also  adequate insurance coverage might not be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all 
for example  we are now not able to obtain product liability insurance with respect to our products menest  delestrogen and pitocin  each a women s healthcare product 
with respect to any product liability claims relating to these products  we could be responsible for any monetary damages awarded by any court or any voluntary monetary settlements 
significant judgments against us for product liability for which we have no insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
product recalls or product field alerts may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of the fda  other government agencies or other companies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical product sales 
from time to time  we may recall products for various reasons  including failure of our products to maintain their stability through their expiration dates 
any recall or product field alert has the potential of damaging the reputation of the product 
to date  these recalls have not been significant and have not had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that the number and significance of recalls will not increase in the future 
any significant recalls could materially affect our sales  the prescription trends for the products and damage the reputation of the products 
in these cases  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
any reduction in reimbursement levels by managed care organizations or other third party payors may have an adverse effect on our revenues 
commercial success in producing  marketing and selling of branded prescription pharmaceutical products depends  in part  on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party health care payors  such as the government  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging whether to reimburse certain pharmaceutical products and medical services 
for example  many managed health care organizations limit reimbursement of pharmaceutical products 
these limits may take the form of formularies with differential co pay tiers 
the resulting competition among pharmaceutical companies to maximize their product reimbursement has generally reduced growth in average selling prices across the industry 
we cannot assure you that our products will be appropriately reimbursed or included on the formulary lists of managed care organizations or that downward pricing pressures in the industry generally will not negatively impact our operations 
the commercial success of some of our products is dependent  in part  on whether third party reimbursement is available for the use of our products by hospitals  clinics  doctors  pharmacies and patients 
third party payors include state and federal governments  under programs such as medicaid and other entitlement programs  as well as managed care organizations  private insurance plans and health maintenance organizations 
because of the growing size of the patient population covered by third party reimbursement  it is important to our business that we market our products to reimbursers that serve many of these organizations 
payment or reimbursement of only a portion of the cost of our prescription products could make our products less attractive  from a net cost perspective  to patients  suppliers  retail pharmacies and prescribing physicians 
managed care organizations and other third party payors try to negotiate the pricing of products to control their costs 
managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop reimbursement coverage strategies  including formularies  to reduce their cost for medications 
formularies can be based on the prices and or therapeutic benefits of the available products 
due to their lower costs  generics receive more favorable reimbursement 
the breadth of the products reimbursed varies considerably from one managed care organization to another  and many formularies include alternative and competitive products or therapies for treatment of particular medical conditions 
denial of a product from reimbursement can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the managed care organization patient population 
if our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided  or if those policies increasingly favor generic products  our market share and gross margins could be negatively affected  as could our overall business and financial condition 
we have addressed our contract relationship with managed care organizations in an effort to increase the attractiveness of reimbursements for our products 
we take reserves for the estimated amounts of rebates we will pay to managed care organizations each quarter 
any increased usage of our products through medicaid or managed care programs will increase the amount of rebates that we owe 
we cannot assure you that our products will be included on the formulary lists of managed care organizations or that adverse reimbursement issues will not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if we fail to comply with the safe harbors provided under various federal and state laws  our business could be adversely affected 
we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive  or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to include  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
the federal government has published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain payment arrangements that do not violate the anti kickback statutes 
we seek to comply with the safe harbors 
due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices  it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti kickback or similar laws 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly in the civil context  or knowingly and willfully in the criminal context  presenting  or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors including medicaid and medicare claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products are currently a subject of the office of inspector general s investigation  and as such they are likely to be subject to scrutiny under these laws 
as discussed in this risk factors section under the headings the investigations by the sec and office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  other possible governmental investigations  and securities  derivative  and erisa litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and elsewhere in this report  we are in the process of quantifying and reporting to governmental agencies our underpayment of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil and or criminal sanctions  including fines and civil monetary penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs including medicaid and medicare 
any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in the future  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials may adversely impact our products 
from time to time studies or clinical trials on various aspects of pharmaceutical products are conducted by academics or others  including government agencies  the results of which  when published  may have dramatic effects on the markets for the pharmaceutical products that are the subject of the study 
the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials related to our products or the therapeutic areas in which our products compete could adversely affect our sales  the prescription trends for our products and the reputation of our products 
one example of these types of studies is the women s health initiative  an ongoing clinical trial conducted by the national institutes of health  which released data in july this data indicated that an increase in certain health risks may result from the long term use of a competitor s combination hormone therapy for women 
news of this data and the perception it created negatively affected the entire combination hormone replacement therapy and the oral estrogen replacement therapy markets  which includes our products menest and delestrogen 
in the event of the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials related to our branded pharmaceutical products or the therapeutic areas in which our products compete  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  potential write offs of the intangible assets associated with the affected products could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
new legislation or regulatory proposals may adversely affect our revenues 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system  including the cost of prescription products  importation and reimportation of prescription products from countries outside the united states and changes in the levels at which pharmaceutical companies are reimbursed for sales of their products  have been proposed 
while we cannot predict when or whether any of these proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals may have on our business  the pending nature of these proposals  as well as the adoption of any proposal  may exacerbate industry wide pricing pressures and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  in  congress directed the fda to adopt regulations allowing the reimportation of approved drugs originally manufactured in the united states back into the united states from other countries where the drugs were sold at a lower price 
although the secretary of health and human services has refused to implement this directive  in july the house of representatives passed a similar bill that does not require the secretary of health and human services to act 
the reimportation bills have not yet resulted in any new laws or regulations  however  these and other initiatives could decrease the price we receive for our products 
additionally sales of our products in the united states could be adversely affected by the importation of products that some may deem to be equivalent to ours that are manufactured by others and are available outside the united states 
changes in the medicare  medicaid or similar governmental programs or the amounts paid by those programs for our services may adversely affect our earnings 
these programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes and cost containment measures 
in recent years  changes in these programs have limited and reduced reimbursement to providers 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  creates a new  voluntary prescription drug benefit under the social security act  which we refer to as medicare drug benefit 
beginning in  medicare beneficiaries entitled to part a or enrolled in part b  as well as certain other medicare enrollees  will be eligible for the medicare drug benefit 
regulations implementing the medicare drug benefit have not yet been published  and the medicare drug act requires that the federal trade commission conduct a study and make recommendations regarding additional legislation that may be needed concerning the medicare drug benefit 
we are unable at this time to predict or estimate the financial impact of this new legislation 
the industry is highly competitive  and other companies in our industry have much greater resources than we do 
in the industry  comparatively smaller pharmaceutical companies like us compete with large  global pharmaceutical companies with substantially greater financial resources for the acquisition of products in development  currently marketed products  technologies and companies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  companies or technologies  additional competitors will not enter the market  or competition for acquisition of products in development  currently marketed products  companies and technologies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also compete with pharmaceutical companies in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  developed or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner and  therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of ours 
we believe that competition for sales of our products will be based primarily on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability and price 
competition for acquisitions 
we compete with other pharmaceutical companies for product and product line acquisitions 
these competitors include biovail corporation  forest laboratories  inc  galen holdings plc  medicis pharmaceutical corporation  shire pharmaceuticals group plc  watson pharmaceuticals  inc  and other companies which also acquire branded pharmaceutical products and product lines  including those in development  from other pharmaceutical companies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to acquire or license commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  companies or technologies  additional competitors will not enter the market  or competition for acquisition of products in development  currently marketed products  companies and technologies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product competition 
additionally  since our currently marketed products are generally established and commonly sold  they are subject to competition from products with similar qualities 
our largest product altace competes in a very competitive and highly genericized market with other cardiovascular therapies 
our product skelaxin competes in a highly genericized market with other muscle relaxants 
our product sonata competes with other insomnia treatments  including in particular ambien  a product of sanofi aventis sa additionally  other potential competitive insomnia products are in development and could enter the market over the next couple of years 
our product levoxyl competes in a competitive and highly genericized market with other levothyroxine sodium products 
we intend to market these products aggressively by  among other things detailing and sampling to the primary prescribing physician groups  and sponsoring physician symposiums  including continuing medical education seminars 
many of our branded pharmaceutical products have either a strong market niche or competitive position 
some of our branded pharmaceutical products face competition from generic substitutes 
for example  the fda approved for sale generic substitutes for florinef in march and in january  for cortisporin ophthalmic suspension in april  and for levoxyl in june the manufacturers of generic products typically do not bear the related research and development costs and  consequently  are able to offer such products at considerably lower prices than the branded equivalents 
there are  however  a number of factors which enable products to remain profitable once patent protection has ceased 
for a manufacturer to launch a generic substitute  it must prove to the fda when filing an application to make a generic substitute that the branded pharmaceutical and the generic substitute have bioequivalence 
we believe it typically takes two or three years to prove bioequivalence and receive fda approval for many generic substitutes 
by focusing our efforts in part on patented products  products with challenging bioequivalence or complex manufacturing requirements and products with a strong brand image with the prescriber or the consumer  supported by the development of a broader range of alternative product formulations or dosage forms  we are better able to maintain market share  gross margins and cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our products will remain exclusive without generic competition  or maintain their market share  gross margins and cash flows as a result of these efforts  the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a warning about forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements relate to analyses and other information which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable

we consider our properties to be generally in good condition  well maintained  and generally suitable and adequate to carry on our business 
item legal proceedings sec investigation and securities litigation as previously reported  in march the sec initiated a formal investigation of king relating to  among other topics  sales of our products to vitarx and prison health services  our best price lists  the pricing of our pharmaceutical products provided to governmental medicaid agencies  the accrual and payment of rebates on the product altace  the products fluogen and lorabid  the king benevolent fund  inc  our calculations related to medicaid rebates  and the audit committee s internal review of issues raised by the sec investigation 
as also previously reported  on november   we received a subpoena duces tecum from the office of inspector general at the department of health and human services requesting the production of documents relating to some of the matters being investigated by the sec and to our sales  marketing and other business practices for altace  aplisol  and levoxyl 
more recently  we have reviewed with the staff of the sec the circumstances giving rise to the restatement of previously issued financial statements as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our determination that we underpaid amounts due to medicaid and other government pricing programs from through  we have continued to engage in discussions with representatives of the sec  the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  the department of justice  the national association of medicaid fraud control units  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the department of veterans affairs  the centers for medicare medicaid services  and the public health service 
our objective in these discussions has been to achieve a comprehensive settlement relating to all the matters being investigated by or discussed with all the governmental authorities 
we have not yet reached any agreements or understandings with respect to the terms of such a settlement and may not ever be able to reach such an agreement 
however  based on the status of the discussions to date  we now believe that it is reasonably likely that we will be able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with all relevant governmental parties on the following terms we have previously accrued million in respect of our estimated underpayments to medicaid and other government pricing programs  and estimated settlement costs with all relevant governmental parties 
this amount includes million accrued for estimated underpayments to medicaid and other government pricing programs and an additional million for estimated settlement costs as an operating expense during the second quarter of to cover interest  costs  fines  penalties and all other additional amounts 
our current expectation is that the aggregate cost to settle with the governmental authorities should not materially exceed the amounts already accrued 
with respect to the matters being investigated by or discussed with the staff of the sec  we currently anticipate that we would settle  without admitting or denying  one or more charges that we failed to maintain adequate books and records and internal controls 
we anticipate that the action to be settled could also include one or more charges that our public filings contained material misstatements or omissions relating to our financial results for some or all of the periods for which results have been restated as discussed under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading restatement of previously issued financial statements 
we do not anticipate being required to restate any results for periods prior to we expect that we will be required to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the department of health and human services  which would require us to submit to audits relating to our medicaid rebate calculations over a five year period 
we do not expect that the resolution of the pending investigations will result in any prohibitions on our sales to medicaid or any related state or federal program  nor do we expect any other material restriction on our ability to conduct our business  although we will be required to incur consultant fees and other expenses in order to comply with the corporate integrity agreement 
we do not expect that any criminal charges will be asserted against the company or against any present or former director  officer or employee in connection with the matters being investigated 
our ability to achieve a settlement on these or other terms is subject to substantial uncertainties 
our discussions to date have been conducted with the staffs of various agencies and other governmental authorities 
we do not yet have any agreements or understandings with any of them 
even if we were to reach such an agreement or understanding with staff personnel  it would be subject to the approval of numerous more senior representatives of the governmental parties  including the members of the us securities and exchange commission  the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  senior officials in the departments of justice  health and human services and veterans affairs  and senior officials in most or all of the states 
we expect that our agreements with the various governmental parties will also require that those governmental parties reach numerous agreements among themselves  and that the consummation of our agreement with each governmental party would be dependent on consummation of our agreements with other governmental parties 
we also expect that some aspects of a comprehensive settlement would require court approval 
in light of these uncertainties  we stress that we may not be able to reach a settlement with the governmental parties  whether on the terms described above or at all 
as a result  the ultimate amount that we will actually have to pay to resolve these matters could be materially more than the amount accrued to date  and the terms could otherwise be materially less favorable than those described above 
because of these uncertainties and the complexity of completing a comprehensive resolution  we are not yet able to estimate with reasonable confidence the amount of time that will be required to enter into and consummate comprehensive settlement agreements 
the possible settlement described above would not apply to the related pending class actions and derivative suits  or any other claims by private plaintiffs 
while we deny any liability  we are unable to predict the outcome of the class actions and derivative suits or reasonably estimate the range of loss  if any 
for additional information  please see the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading governmental investigations and securities litigation 
subsequent to the announcement of the sec investigation described above  beginning in march  purported class action complaints were filed by holders of our securities against us  our directors  former directors  our executive officers  former executive officers  a subsidiary  and a former director of the subsidiary in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  alleging violations of the securities act of and or the securities exchange act of these complaints have been consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee 
in addition  holders of our securities filed two class action complaints alleging violations of the securities act of in tennessee state court 
we removed these two cases to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  where these two cases were consolidated with the other class actions 
plaintiffs in these actions unsuccessfully moved to remand these two cases back to tennessee state court 
these two actions therefore remain part of the consolidated action 
the district court has appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action  and those lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on october  alleging that we  through some of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  and former directors  made false or misleading statements concerning our business  financial condition  and results of operations during periods beginning february  and continuing until march  plaintiffs in the consolidated action have also named the underwriters of our november public offering as defendants 
we and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
on august   the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee ruled on defendants motions to dismiss 
the court dismissed all claims as to jones pharma  inc  a predecessor to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  king research and development  inc  and as to defendants dennis jones and henry richards 
the court also dismissed certain claims as to five other individual defendants 
the court denied the motions to dismiss in all other respects 
following the court s ruling  on september   we and the other remaining defendants filed answers to plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint 
discovery and other proceedings in the case are continuing  and no trial date has been set 
seven purported shareholder derivative complaints have also been filed in federal and state courts in tennessee alleging a breach of fiduciary duty  among other things  by some of our officers and directors 
on october   all of the defendants named in this action filed a partial answer to the amended consolidated derivative and class action complaint 
discovery in this action has commenced 
no trial date has been set 
another purported class action complaint was filed on august  in tennessee state court against us and the members of our board of directors 
this new case largely asserts substantially the same claims and seeks the same relief as the class action claim that was recently added to the state derivative action described above 
defendants in that action filed a motion to dismiss on november   that motion is pending and no hearing date has been set 
additionally  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee under erisa 
as amended  the complaint alleges that we and certain of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  former directors and an employee violated fiduciary duties that they allegedly owed our k retirement savings plan s participants and beneficiaries under erisa 
the allegations underlying this action are similar in many respects to those in the class action litigation described above 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the erisa action on march  the district court judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation 
on december   the magistrate judge held a hearing on this motion  and  on december   he recommended that the district court judge dismiss the action 
the district court judge accepted the recommendation and dismissed the case on february  we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously but are unable currently to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any 
if any governmental sanctions are imposed in excess of those described above  or if we were not to prevail in the pending litigation  neither of which we can predict or reasonably estimate at this time  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
responding to the governmental investigations  resolving the amounts owed to governmental agencies in connection with the underpayments and defending us in the pending litigation has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and the payment of additional professional fees

under the hatch waxman act  any generic manufacturer may file an anda with a paragraph iv certification  challenging the validity or infringement of a patent listed in the fda s orange book four years after the pioneer company obtains approval of its nda 
cobalt has filed a paragraph iv certification alleging invalidity of the patent  and we filed suit on march  in the district court for the district of massachusetts to enforce our rights under that patent 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of that suit provides us an automatic stay of fda approval of cobalt s anda for months from no earlier than february  in march  cobalt stipulated to infringement of the patent 
should the court find in favor of a cobalt summary judgment motion on the patent  we would not receive the full benefit of that month stay 
subsequent to filing our original complaint  we amended our complaint to add an allegation of infringement of the patent 
the patent covers one of altace s three indications for use 
in response to the amended complaint  cobalt informed the fda that it no longer seeks approval to market its proposed product for the indication covered by the patent 
on this basis  the court granted cobalt summary judgment of non infringement of the patent 
the court s decision does not affect cobalt s infringement of the patent 
we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under the and patents

 the patent  and  the patent  two method of use patents relating to skelaxin  are listed in the fda s orange book and do not expire until december  eon labs and corepharma have each filed paragraph iv certifications alleging noninfringement and invalidity of the and patents 
mutual has filed a paragraph iv certification alleging noninfringement and invalidity of the patent 
we filed a patent infringement suit against eon labs on january  in the district court for the eastern district of new york  corepharma on march  in the district court for the district of new jersey subsequently transferred to the district court for the eastern district of new york  and mutual on march  in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania concerning their proposed mg products 
additionally  we filed a separate suit against eon labs on december  in the district court for the eastern district of new york  concerning its proposed mg product 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of the suit against corepharma provides us with an automatic stay of fda approval of corepharma s anda for months from no earlier than january  also pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of the suits against eon labs provides us with an automatic stay of fda approval of eon labs anda for its proposed mg and mg products for months from no earlier than november   and november   respectively 
we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under the and patents to the full extent of the law 
on march   we received a copy of a letter from the fda to all anda applicants for skelaxin stating that the use listed in the fda s orange book for the patent may be deleted from the anda applicants product labeling 
we believe that this decision is arbitrary  capricious  and inconsistent with the fda s previous position on this issue 
we filed a citizen petition on march  supplemented on april  and on july   requesting the fda to rescind that letter  require generic applicants to submit paragraph iv certifications for the patent  and prohibit the removal of information corresponding to the use listed in the orange book  king concurrently filed a petition for stay of action requesting the fda to stay approval of any generic metaxalone products until the fda has fully evaluated our citizen petition 
on march   the fda sent a letter to us explaining that our proposed labeling revision  which includes references to additional clinical studies relating to food  age  and gender effects  was approvable and only required certain formatting changes 
on april   we submitted amended labeling text that incorporated those changes 
on april   mutual filed a petition for stay of action requesting the fda to stay approval of our proposed labeling revision until the fda has fully evaluated and ruled upon our citizen petition  as well as all comments submitted in response to that petition 
discussions with the fda concerning appropriate labeling are ongoing 
corepharma  mutual and we have filed responses and supplements to the pending citizen petition 
if our citizen petition is rejected  there is a substantial likelihood that a generic version of skelaxin will enter the market  and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
prefest patent challenge barr has filed an anda  which included a paragraph iv certification  with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of prefest 
united states patent no 
 the patent  a utility patent with method of treatment claims relating to prefest  and united states patent no

pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of that suit provides us an automatic stay of fda approval of barr s anda for months from no earlier than october  on june   the us patent and trademark office issued united states patent no 
 the patent 
the patent relates to pharmaceutical preparations  pharmaceutical packages and methods of treating a female in need of hormone replacement therapy by administering a specific dose combination of estrogen and progestin 
we have certified that the patent covers the prefest product and  therefore the patent has been listed in the orange book 
on june   we received a notice letter from barr concerning its amended paragraph iv certification to its anda for prefest 
the notice letter outlines barr s assertions of invalidity and noninfringement of the patent 
on july   we filed a complaint in the southern district of new york for infringement of the patent 
on november   we sold all of our rights in prefest for approximately  as a result of this transaction  the lawsuit was dismissed on january  thimerosal vaccine related litigation king and its wholly owned subsidiary  parkedale pharmaceuticals  have been named as defendants in california  mississippi and illinois  along with other pharmaceutical companies which have manufactured or sold products containing the mercury based preservative  thimerosal 
in these cases  the plaintiffs attempt to link the receipt of the mercury based products to neurological defects 
the plaintiffs claim unfair business practices  fraudulent misrepresentations  negligent misrepresentations  and breach of implied warranty  which are all arguments premised on the idea that the defendants promoted products without any reference to the toxic hazards and potential public health ramifications resulting from the mercury containing preservative 
the plaintiffs also allege that the defendants knew of the dangerous propensities of thimerosal in their products 
king s product liability insurance carrier has been given proper notice of all of these matters and defense counsel are vigorously defending our interests 
we have filed motions to dismiss due to  among other things  lack of product identity in plaintiff s complaints 
in  king and parkedale were dismissed on this basis in a similar case 
we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously but are unable to currently predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any 
hormone replacement therapy we have been named as a defendant in four lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of hormone replacement therapy drugs 
numerous pharmaceutical companies have also been sued 
these cases have been filed in alabama  pennsylvania  ohio and mississippi 
the plaintiffs allege that king and other defendants failed to conduct adequate pre approval research and post approval surveillance to establish the safety of the long term hormone therapy regimen  thus misleading consumers when marketing their products 
plaintiffs claims include allegations of negligence  strict liability  breach of implied warranty  breach of express warranty  fraud and misrepresentation 
we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously but are unable currently to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any 
average wholesale pricing litigation in august  king and monarch pharmaceuticals  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of king  were named as defendants along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers in an action brought by the city of new york  which we refer to as nyc  in federal court in the state of new york 
nyc claims that the defendants fraudulently inflated their average wholesale prices and fraudulently failed to accurately report their best prices and their average manufacturer s prices and failed to pay proper rebates pursuant to federal law 
additional claims allege violations of federal and new york statutes  fraud and unjust enrichment 
for the period from to the present  nyc is requesting money damages  civil penalties  declaratory and injunctive relief  restitution  disgorgement of profits  and treble and punitive damages 
in august  a defendant in the nyc action sought to have the action transferred to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts and combined with existing multi district litigation  entitled in re average wholesale pricing litigation  being heard by that court 
a conditional transfer order was issued during september indicating that the action is subject to transfer for pretrial proceedings to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
we intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously but are unable currently to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of loss  if any 
we also have been named as a defendant along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers in four other lawsuits containing allegations of fraudulently inflating average wholesale prices 
these lawsuits have been filed in federal courts in new york and massachusetts  and in state courts in new york and alabama  all of which we will seek to have transferred to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts and combined with the existing multi district litigation 
fen phen litigation many distributors  marketers and manufacturers of anorexigenic drugs have been subject to claims relating to the use of these drugs 
generally  the lawsuits allege that the defendants misled users of the products with respect to the dangers associated with them  failed to adequately test the products  and knew or should have known about the negative effects of the drugs  and should have informed the public about the risks of such negative effects 
the actions generally have been brought by individuals in their own right and have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions throughout the united states 
they seek  among other things  compensatory and punitive damages and or court supervised medical monitoring of persons who have ingested the product 
we are one of many defendants in no more than lawsuits that claim damages for personal injury arising from our production of the anorexigenic drug phentermine under contract for glaxosmithkline 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these suits  we believe that the claims against us are without merit and intend to vigorously pursue all defenses available to us 
we are being indemnified in all of these suits by glaxosmithkline for which we manufactured the anorexigenic product  provided that neither the lawsuits nor the associated liabilities are based upon our independent negligence or intentional acts  and intend to submit a claim for all unreimbursed costs to our product liability insurance carrier 
however  in the event that glaxosmithkline is unable to satisfy or fulfill its obligations under the indemnity  we would have to defend the lawsuits and be responsible for damages  if any  which are awarded against us or for amounts in excess of our product liability coverage 
a reasonable estimate of potential losses related to these suits cannot be made 
in addition  king research and development  successor to jones and a wholly owned subsidiary of king  is a defendant in multi defendant lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine  and phentermine 
these suits have been filed in various jurisdictions throughout the united states  and in each of these suits  king research and development is one of many defendants  including manufacturers and other distributors of these drugs 
although jones did not at any time manufactured dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine  or phentermine  jones was a distributor of a generic phentermine product  and  after its acquisition of abana pharmaceuticals  was a distributor of obenix  its branded phentermine product 
the plaintiffs in these cases claim injury as a result of ingesting a combination of these weight loss drugs and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as medical care and court supervised medical monitoring 
the plaintiffs claim liability based on a variety of theories including but not limited to product liability  strict liability  negligence  breach of warranty  and misrepresentation 
king research and development denies any liability incident to the distribution of obenix or jones generic phentermine product and intends to pursue all defenses available to it 
king research and development has tendered defense of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers for handling and they are currently defending king research and development in these suits 
the manufacturers of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine have settled many of these cases 
in the event king research and development s insurance coverage is inadequate to satisfy any resulting liability  king research and development will have to resume defense of these lawsuits and be responsible for the damages  if any  that are awarded against it 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these suits  we believe that the claims against king research and development are without merit and intend to vigorously pursue all defenses available to it 
we are unable to disclose an aggregate dollar amount of damages claimed because many of these complaints are multi party suits and do not state specific damage amounts 
rather  these claims typically state damages as may be determined by the court or similar language and state no specific amount of damages against king research and development 
additionally  we cannot reasonably estimate potential losses related to lawsuits 
other legal proceedings our rochester facility was one of six pfizer facilities subject to a consent decree issued by the us district court of new jersey in august as a result of fda concerns about compliance issues within pfizer facilities in the period before the decree was entered 
we acquired the parkedale facility from pfizer in february the parkedale facility is currently manufacturing pharmaceutical products subject to the consent decree which prohibits the manufacture and delivery of specified drug products unless  among other things  the products conform to cgmps and are produced in accordance with approved drug applications 
we intend  when appropriate  to petition for relief from the consent decree 
we are involved in various routine legal proceedings incident to the ordinary course of our business

i 
overview introduction we are a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures  markets and sells branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
we seek to capitalize on opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry through the development  including through in licensing arrangements and acquisitions  of novel branded prescription pharmaceutical products in attractive markets and the strategic acquisition of branded products that can benefit from focused promotion and marketing and product life cycle management 
during  we implemented many changes at king pharmaceuticals designed to re establish a firm foundation on which to build the future success of our company 
these changes included the recruitment of new key leadership to enhance our executive management team  which included the appointment of brian a 
markison as our president and chief executive officer 
with new leadership in place  we worked diligently during to rebase our operations and identify our strengths and weaknesses 
we achieved a number of significant accomplishments in furtherance of this goal  including relocating our commercial operations organization to new jersey  expanding our business development group  reprioritizing our research and development portfolio  and implementing new processes and policies to enhance financial controls  institutionalize cost control and improve production planning 
while our actions to financially rebase our company necessarily negatively affected our financial results in  it is important to note that we continued to generate solid cash flow 
commercial operations we have significantly restructured our commercial operations organization 
this process began with the hiring of steve andrzejewski as corporate head of commercial operations  with responsibility for our sales  marketing and managed care activities 
since then  we have worked to right size our sales force and improve compensation to attract talent and reward top performers 
additionally  we strengthened our marketing  market research  and administrative structure 
with our enhanced commercial operations capability  we plan to maximize the potential of our currently marketed products as a revenue generating platform to fund product development and external business development 
business development business development should continue to play a major role in our future growth strategy 
with the addition of new talent and new acquisition criteria  we are working to strengthen our product portfolio 
by diligently adding products with significant growth potential and divesting underperforming assets  we seek to improve our long term prospects 
research and development during  we reprioritized our research and development portfolio  with an enhanced focus on projects with the greatest probability to deliver long term value 
our research and development activities involve the development of chemical compounds  including new chemical entities  to provide us with strategic pipeline opportunities for the commercialization of new branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
in addition to developing these chemical compounds  we pursue means of enhancing the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that may provide additional benefits to patients  and improvements in the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing processes 
binodenoson on december   we commenced the pivotal phase iii clinical trial program involving binodenoson 
binodenoson is an adenosine aa receptor agonist that we are developing for cardiac pharmacologic stress spect imaging  a procedure used to diagnose the presence and severity of coronary artery disease 
the data from the phase ii dose ranging study indicates that binodenoson  at effective doses  is better tolerated than adenosine  the current market leader  which was previously developed by king 
approximately million pharmacologic stress tests are performed in the united states each year to diagnose heart disease in patients who cannot perform traditional exercise stress tests 
adenosine and dipyridamole are the current agents of choice to achieve the coronary vasodilation necessary for cardiac imaging in the united states  but these drugs do not distinguish between the four subtypes of adenosine receptors 
our phase ii clinical trials showed that by targeting the adenosine aa receptor subtype  binodenoson appears to detect myocardial ischemia as well as adenosine  and produces fewer and less severe side effects like heart block  dyspnea and chest pain than adenosine and dipyridamole 
unlike the currently used drugs  which are administered over to minutes  binodenoson will be given as an intravenous bolus dose 
pt on august   we entered into a collaborative agreement with palatin technologies  inc to jointly develop and  on obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  commercialize palatin s pt for the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction 
pt is the first compound in a new drug class called melanocortin receptor agonists under development to treat sexual dysfunction 
this new chemical entity is being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety profile of varying doses of this novel compound in men experiencing ed and women experiencing fsd 
although the current ed market is primarily served by pde inhibitors which target the vascular system  a substantial unmet medical need for alternative sexual dysfunction therapies exists 
many patients are contraindicated for  or non responsive to  pde inhibitors 
for example  pde inhibitors are contraindicated in patients taking nitrates  which are prescribed primarily for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
current clinical data indicates that pt should not have any drug interactions with nitrates 
for additional information regarding pt  please see the section below entitled strategic developments 
sonata modified release formulation pursuant to an agreement between us and elan  elan commenced a phase ii clinical trial program for the purpose of developing a modified release formulation of sonata mr in march however  the phase ii clinical trial results showed that the sonata mr formulations that elan developed did not meet contractually required specifications 
after several months of review  we concluded that it was not possible for elan to develop a sonata mr formulation meeting the contractually required specifications 
accordingly  we decided to discontinue the sonata mr clinical program and intend to terminate the agreement with elan 
although we believe we are entitled to terminate the agreement  we can provide no assurance that we will effectively terminate the agreement and  if we do  under what terms 
the agreement currently requires us to pay up to an additional million if elan achieves certain milestones in connection with the development of a reformulated version of sonata and million as a milestone payment if annual net sales of a reformulated version of sonata exceed million  plus costs associated with the development of a reformulated version of sonata 
mre mre  a new chemical entity  is an adenosine aa receptor agonist that we are developing as a potential topical treatment for chronic diabetic foot ulcers 
this product is designed to utilize a novel approach to treating this condition by concentrating on the inflammation associated with such foot ulcers 
adenosine aa receptor agonists have been shown to promote wound closure in mice and diabetes induced rats by regulating the response of inflammatory cells and mediators  promoting tissue formation through various mechanisms including endothelial cell proliferation and migration  and promoting tissue remodeling 
in january we completed the dosing of the initial concentration of mre in our ongoing phase i clinical trial program evaluating the safety of the drug in patients 
t during the fourth quarter of  we commenced the phase i clinical trial program for t  a new chemical entity that we are developing as a potential treatment for neuropathic pain 
when given orally  t enhances the effect of endogenous adenosine in the spinal cord and should provide effective relief for neuropathic pain by the same mechanism as intrathecally administered adenosine 
adenosine  a neurotransmitter that affects the adenosine a receptors in the spinal cord to normalize the pain response  has been shown to be an effective treatment for neuropathic pain when injected into the spinal cord via intrathecal administration 
the initial phase i trial for t is a single center  randomized double blind  placebo controlled evaluation of the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of this new chemical entity in healthy adult subjects 
altace product life cycle projects during the fourth quarter of  we completed the phase iv clinical trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of altace in the treatment of hypertension high blood pressure in children 
we refer to this important trial as tophat treatment of pediatric hypertension with altace trial 
additionally  we are working to develop an altace diuretic combination product 
cash flow although our total revenues decreased in  primarily as a result of our aggressive reduction of wholesale inventory levels of our products  our cash from operations totaled million during the year 
accordingly  cash and cash equivalents  not including restricted cash  grew to million as of december  from million at the end of restatement of previously issued financial statements we have restated our previously issued financial statements for the years and  including interim periods in  and the first two quarters of  primarily to reflect the correction of methodological errors related to our reserve for product returns 
after experiencing an unusually high level of product returns during late and the first three quarters of  we decided to conduct a thorough evaluation of our returns reserve before formally closing the third quarter of accordingly  on october   we publicly announced that we were conducting such a review and that our preliminary financial results for the third quarter of were subject to change as a result of the review 
we subsequently delayed the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   which we are filing contemporaneously with this annual report on form k 
in connection with our now completed review  we have concluded that the recent large returns were primarily the result of our entry into imas  with our largest wholesalers  together with several product specific developments 
however  we also determined that our methodology for reserving for product returns from the first quarter of through the second quarter of contained errors  with the result that estimated product returns were not recorded in the period required under gaap 
also in connection with our review  we concluded that certain other immaterial items should have been recognized in earlier periods 
the errors described above resulted from policies adopted in good faith and after discussion with our independent auditors 
these errors are unrelated to the ongoing investigations of us by the sec and the oig 
all amounts referenced in this annual report for and  including interim periods in  and the first two quarters of reflect the relevant amounts on a restated basis 
we will not amend our annual reports on form k for the years ended december  or  or our quarterly reports on form q for quarterly periods from january  through june  the previously issued financial statements for   and the first two quarters of should no longer be relied upon 
returns reserve and other restatement items returns reserve 
gaap requires that we reserve for expected product returns when recognizing sales to wholesalers and other customers  who have the right to return products for specified periods 
from the first quarter of through the second quarter of  we used the replacement cost method to value our reserve for product returns 
under that method  our reserve for future product returns was valued at the cost to manufacture replacement product 
we discontinued use of the replacement cost method effective july   and began valuing our returns reserve at the sales value of returned products 
in connection with the recent review of our returns reserve  management has concluded that use of the replacement cost method constituted an error 
from the third quarter of through the second quarter of  we accrued for product returns based in part on our estimate of inventory in the wholesale and retail distribution channels 
management has concluded that this methodology also contained an error  because it did not take into account the shelf life of our products in the wholesale distribution channels 
as a result of these conclusions  we have adopted revised policies and procedures for establishing reserves for product returns 
the revised methodology is described in the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading critical accounting policies 
previously disclosed immaterial medicaid errors 
the restatement has not resulted in any change in the amounts of previously reported errors in respect of medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
the restatement has  however  changed how the immaterial medicaid errors are reflected in the financial statements 
we have previously disclosed immaterial medicaid errors that had arisen during through and recorded those amounts in the fourth quarter of as described below  as part of the restatement  all immaterial errors  including those medicaid errors  which arose prior to and that were previously recorded as charges in have been removed as charges from the income statement 
the aggregate amount of those immaterial errors is instead recorded as part of the adjustment to the opening balance january  of retained earnings in the restated financial statements 
other immaterial items 
in the course of our returns review  we determined that in some instances our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel did not properly reflect relevant data in our possession  and that we thereby inadvertently under accrued for estimated future chargeback amounts 
chargebacks are credits issued to wholesalers who purchase at published wholesale prices when they resell our products to a customer entitled to a discount pursuant to the customer s agreement with us 
the wholesaler allows its customer to purchase at the discounted price  and then the wholesaler recovers the amount of the discount from us via a chargeback 
following our determination that we would restate our financial statements for  and the first two quarters of  we also determined that we would correct for other known miscellaneous immaterial errors made in the application of gaap that arose during those periods 
our restated financial statements reflect each of these items in the period in which it actually arose 
use of estimates in restatement items 
investors should be aware that the amounts being restated are largely estimates  including most importantly estimates of future product returns 
gaap requires that we reserve for expected product returns when recognizing sales to wholesalers and other customers  who have the right to return products for specified periods 
because we identified flaws in the methodology we had used to generate our prior estimates of expected product returns  for purposes of the restatement we have prepared new estimates by retroactively applying our revised methodology commencing january  we believe that the new estimates are reasonable and appropriate for inclusion in the restated financial statements 
nevertheless  estimates require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
our new estimates may or may not be the same as those that we actually would have generated during earlier periods if we had in fact been using our revised methodology during those periods

as a result  in april we successfully entered into imas with each of our three key wholesale customers covering all of our branded products for the purpose of improving our visibility and reducing the level of wholesale inventories of our products 
as we anticipated  entering into the inventory management agreements adversely affected net sales of some of our branded pharmaceutical products during  as we aggressively reduced wholesale inventory levels of these products 
during the fourth quarter of we began working to amend our imas with our key wholesale customers with the objective of further reducing their inventory of our products 
as a result  the average wholesale inventory level of our key products was further reduced during the fourth quarter of we anticipate the substantial completion of wholesale channel inventory reductions of our key products by the end of the first quarter of as of december   the wholesale inventory levels of our four key branded pharmaceutical products  altace  skelaxin  sonata and levoxyl  based on data obtained through our inventory management agreements with our three largest customers and ims america prescription data  were on average at a level of slightly less than months of demand 
we believe this level of approximately months of end user demand represents gross sales of approximately million 
sales of key products altace net sales of altace equaled million for the year ended december   a decrease from million during  while total prescriptions increased to million during in comparison to the prior year according to ndc monthly prescription data 
our lower net sales of altace during was due to wholesale inventory reductions and increased rebates and chargebacks  the combined effect of which was modestly offset by price increases 
we estimate that if net sales of altace during had reflected actual end user demand for the product  altace net sales would have equaled approximately million 
although we anticipate some continued wholesale inventory reductions of altace during the first quarter of  we believe that net sales of this product during the following three quarters of should more closely reflect demand based sales 
for additional information and a description of the effect of wholesale channel inventory on net sales  please see the section above entitled wholesale inventory reductions 
based on altace s unique indication  positive clinical data and prescription trends  we anticipate continued prescription growth for this product during altace s differentiating indication is based on evidence from the heart outcome prevention evaluation hope clinical trial  which proved that altace mg reduces the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack  stroke and cardiovascular death in high risk patients  years of age or older 
for additional information regarding altace  please see under the heading altace patent challenge in the section below entitled other developments 
thrombin jmi net sales of thrombin jmi totaled million in  a increase from million during the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to price increases  as total net units of thrombin jmi sold decreased during compared to the prior year 
while we are near maximum capacity at our facility in madison  wisconsin  which will limit our ability to increase unit sales of thrombin jmi during  we are currently working to expand our production capacity for thrombin jmi 
we anticipate that we should complete a portion of this expanded capacity during the fourth quarter of skelaxin during  net sales of skelaxin totaled million 
we acquired this product from elan on june  wholesale inventories of this product were reduced during we estimate that if net sales of skelaxin during had reflected actual end user demand for the product  skelaxin net sales would have equaled approximately million 
we believe that net sales of this product during should more closely reflect demand based sales 
for additional information and a description of the effect of wholesale channel inventory on net sales  please see the section above entitled wholesale inventory reductions 
as previously disclosed  the skelaxin patents are the subject of multiple challenges 
moreover  during march the fda sent a letter to all anda applicants for skelaxin suggesting that critical information in the product s official packaging circular could be deleted from the labeling proposed by anda applicants and that the anda applicants could then obtain approval of their anda without completing the standard paragraph iv certification process 
we believe that removing the critical language from any metaxalone label could pose serious issues for patients and practitioners 
accordingly  we believe that before approving the applicant s anda the fda should require any skelaxin anda applicant to include the critical language in its label and complete the standard paragraph iv certification process 
under the current circumstances  the continued exclusivity of skelaxin is unpredictable and we cannot assure that the product will remain exclusive for any length of time 
for additional information regarding skelaxin  please see under the heading skelaxin patent challenge in the section below entitled other developments 
the new  convenient mg dose of skelaxin has been well received by physicians 
the formulation offers patients the benefits of muscle pain relief without the complication of sedation  allowing them to pursue normal  everyday activities 
sonata net sales of sonata equaled million in we acquired this product from elan in june we estimate that if net sales of sonata during had reflected actual end user demand for the product  sonata net sales would have equaled approximately million 
although we anticipate some continued wholesale inventory reductions of sonata during the first quarter of  we believe that net sales of this product during the following three quarters of should more closely reflect demand based sales 
physicians have reacted positively to sonata s positioning for patients who have difficulty falling asleep 
because of its shorter half life  we believe that patients experience a faster onset of action and have little or no hang over effect in the morning 
we believe the first quarter launch of the unit dose package should more competitively position sonata in the hospital environment 
levoxyl levoxyl net sales were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million during the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the entry of generic competition for the product in june  an increase in the amount of our rebates for the product in order to better address the entry of generic competition  and the continued reduction in wholesale inventories of levoxyl 
as a result  total net units of levoxyl sold decreased for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
total prescriptions decreased approximately from to  according to ndc monthly prescription data 
entry of generic competition for levoxyl on august   the us food and drug administration  which we refer to as the fda  announced in the federal register fr that orally administered levothyroxine sodium drug products are new drugs 
the notice stated that manufacturers who wish to continue to market these products must submit applications as required by the fdc act by august  on april   the fda issued a second federal register notice extending the deadline for filing these applications until august  on may   the fda approved our new drug application  which we refer to in this report as an nda  for levoxyl  our levothyroxine sodium product 
during and  we filed with the us patent and trademark office in excess of applications for us patents concerning our fda approved product levoxyl 
the first us patent on levoxyl  the patent  a utility patent with composition of matter claims  listed in the fda s orange book  was issued on april  and extends through february  we cannot assure you that any or all of the other patent applications currently under review will be issued 
we filed a citizen petition with the fda on march  requesting that the fda refrain from approving or accepting for filing any abbreviated new drug application  which we refer to as anda  or supplemental abbreviated new drug application  which we refer to as sanda  for levothyroxine sodium drug products until adequate standards for establishing bioequivalence for levothyroxine sodium drug products are adopted in accordance with fda procedures 
a manufacturer of another major levothyroxine sodium product and professional endocrinology societies submitted similar and or related comments to the fda 
mylan and kv pharmaceutical company each filed an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of levoxyl 
no earlier than april   we received notice of mylan s paragraph iv certification  which alleges noninfringement of the patent 
on june   we received notice of kv s paragraph iv certification  which alleges noninfringement and invalidity of the patent 
we have filed separate suits against mylan and kv alleging infringement of the patent 
on june   the fda denied our citizen petition and approved supplemental new drug applications  which we refer to as an snda  filed by alara pharmaceuticals  inc and jerome stevens pharmaceutical  inc 
under b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  usc et seq 
seeking to market their currently approved products levo t and unithroid  respectively as bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent ie  ab rated to our levoxyl 
neither alara nor jerome submitted a patent certification under usc b a against our patent  despite its listing in the orange book as applicable to levoxyl 
in response  we filed an action in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in the form of an order directing the fda to withdraw its approval of the two sndas 
alara intervened in the action 
in an order dated july   however  the court denied our request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on the basis that we could not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of our claim 
in view of the court s order  the parties stipulated to a dismissal of the lawsuit 
on july   the fda approved an sanda filed by mylan under usc j  seeking to market mylan s currently approved levothyroxine sodium tablets as ab rated to levoxyl 
as with alara and jerome stevens  the fda did not require mylan to certify against our patent because unithroid  not levoxyl  is the listed drug referred to in mylan s original anda 
in view of the fda s decision to designate other levothyroxine sodium products as ab rated to levoxyl and in further view of the merger with mylan that was pending at that time  the kv suit was dismissed pursuant to our application for dismissal  and the mylan suit was suspended 
levothyroxine sodium is a drug recognized to have a narrow toxic to therapeutic ratio with significant clinical consequences of excessive or inadequate treatment 
the american thyroid association  the endocrine society  and the american association of clinical endocrinologists have all raised concerns regarding patients being switched among a number of levothyroxine sodium preparations 
accordingly  these organizations have advised physicians caring for patients on levothyroxine sodium therapy to encourage their patients to ask to remain on their current levothyroxine sodium preparation 
nevertheless  sales of levoxyl were materially adversely affected in the third quarter of and will most likely continue to decline in future periods 
strategic developments pt on august   we entered into a collaborative agreement with palatin technologies  inc to jointly develop and  on obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  commercialize palatin s pt for the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  palatin has granted king a co exclusive license with palatin to pt in north america and an exclusive right to collaborate in the licensing or sublicensing of pt with palatin outside north america 
pt is the first compound in a new drug class called melanocortin receptor agonists under development to treat sexual dysfunction 
this new chemical entity is being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety profile of varying doses of this novel compound in men experiencing ed and women experiencing fsd 
although the current ed market is primarily served by pde inhibitors which target the vascular system  a substantial unmet medical need for alternative sexual dysfunction therapies exists 
many patients are contraindicated for  or non responsive to  pde inhibitors 
for example  pde inhibitors are contraindicated in patients taking nitrates  which are prescribed primarily for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
current clinical data indicates that pt should not have any drug interactions with nitrates 
we paid palatin approximately million on entering into the collaborative agreement  which included a million equity investment in palatin 
additionally  we may pay potential milestone payments to palatin of up to million for achieving certain ed and fsd development and regulatory approval targets 
after regulatory approval and commercialization of pt  we may also pay potential milestone payments to palatin of up to million upon achieving specified annual north american net sales thresholds

our rochester facility and intangible assets related to some non key products our rochester facility manufactures products for us and various third party manufacturers 
as of december   the net carrying value of the property  plant  and equipment at the rochester facility was million 
overall production volume at this facility has declined 
we currently have plans to transfer to this facility the manufacture of some of our branded prescription pharmaceutical products that are currently manufactured for us by third parties 
this should increase production and overall profitability at our rochester facility 
management currently believes that these long term assets are not impaired based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  if production volumes continue to decline and or if we are not successful in transferring additional production to the facility  we may have to write off a portion of the property  plant and equipment associated with the facility 
demand for some of our non key products  including but not limited to intal  tilade and corzide  declined over the past year at a rate which triggered a review of the intangible assets associated with these products 
the net intangible assets reviewed for possible impairment totals approximately  million 
we believe that these intangible assets are not currently impaired based on estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
however  if demand for the products associated with these intangible assets declines below current expectations  we may have to write off a portion or all of these intangible assets

ongoing research  referred to as the women s health initiative  is being conducted by the national institutes of health 
data from the trial released in july indicated that an increase in certain health risks may result from the long term use of a competitor s combination hormone replacement therapy for women 
news of this data and the perception it created negatively affected the entire combination hormone therapy and the oral estrogen therapy markets including some of our products 
prescriptions for some of our other women s health products have also continued to decline over the past few years primarily due to the availability of generics 
during the first quarter of  our board of directors approved management s decision to market for divestiture many of our women s health products

however  it should be noted that the determination of whether to classify an item as a special charge involves judgments by us 
cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of special items affecting cost of revenues and lower unit sales of our branded pharmaceutical products in as compared to special items affecting cost of revenues in resulted in a net charge equaling million compared to a net charge of million in special items included in cost of revenues during and are discussed below

other income expense interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to lower balances of invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during as compared to interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our financial results in include a special income item in the amount of million to reflect the decrease in the valuation allowance for the convertible notes receivable from novavax 
novavax repurchased the convertible notes from us in income tax expense the effective tax rate was in and in the effective tax rate in was different than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to favorable adjustments in the overall state tax rate  research and development tax credits  donations of branded prescription pharmaceutical products and tax exempt interest 
the effective tax rate in was higher then the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible in process research and development charges incurred in connection with our acquisition of meridian 
income from continuing operations due to the factors set forth above  income from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in from million in discontinued operations during the first quarter of  our board of directors approved management s decision to market for divestiture some of our women s health products  including prefest and nordette 
these products were divested in these product rights held for sale had identifiable cash flows that were largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities and are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
accordingly  all net sales  cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative costs and amortization associated with prefest and nordette are included in discontinued operations in and during and  loss income from discontinued operations equaled million and million  or million and million net of income tax expense  respectively 
net income due to the factors set forth above  net income decreased million  or  to million in from million in off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  except for operating leases in the normal course of business as described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report  and as reflected in the table below 
the following summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than one to four to more than total one year three years five years five years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total our unconditional purchase obligations are primarily related to minimum purchase requirements under contracts with suppliers to purchase raw materials and finished goods related to our branded pharmaceutical products 
the above table does not reflect any potential milestone payments in connection with research and development projects or acquisitions 
we have a supply agreement with sanofi aventis sa to produce ramipril  the active ingredient in altace 
this supply agreement is reflected in the unconditional purchase obligations above 
this supply agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum levels of ramipril 
if sales of altace do not increase at the currently anticipated rates  if we are unable to maintain market exclusivity for altace in accordance with our current expectations  if our product life cycle management is not successful  or if we do not terminate the supply agreement at an optimal time for us  we may incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreement 
in the event we incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreement  there may be a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and cash flows 
we have binding purchase orders for metaxalone  the active ingredient in skelaxin 
these purchase orders are reflected in the unconditional purchase obligations above 
these purchase orders require us to purchase certain minimum amounts of metaxalone 
if sales of skelaxin do not continue as currently anticipated  we may incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under these purchase orders 
in the event we incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under these purchase orders  there may be a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and cash flows 
we have a supply agreement with eli lilly to produce lorabid which is reflected in the unconditional purchase obligations above 
this supply agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum levels of inventory of lorabid through september  based on changes in estimated prescription trends  we believe our minimum purchase commitments under the supply agreement are greater than that which we will be able to sell to our customers 
as a result  we recorded charges of million during december and million during december related to the liability associated with the amount of our purchase commitments in excess of expected demand 
as of december   we have million of additional exposure related to the supply agreement if prescriptions for lorabid continue to decline 
liquidity and capital resources general we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  our existing revolving credit facility and funds available to us under our universal shelf registration are sufficient to finance our current operations and working capital requirements on both a short term and long term basis 
however  in the event we make significant future acquisitions or change our capital structure  we may be required to raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
as additional consideration for synercid  an injectable antibiotic acquired on december   we agreed to potential milestone payments 
we will pay sanofi aventis a milestone payment of million on december   if there is continued recognition of synercid as an effective treatment for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium on that date 
an additional million milestone is payable to aventis if synercid should receive fda approval to treat methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or we will pay aventis a one time payment of million the first time during any twelve month period net sales of synercid exceed million  and a one time payment of million the first time during any twelve month period net sales of synercid exceed million 
on june   we acquired the primary care business of elan and of some of its subsidiaries in the united states and puerto rico  which includes the rights to two branded prescription pharmaceutical products  sonata and skelaxin 
we will pay royalties on the current formulation of skelaxin from the date of closing 
as discussed above  elan was working to develop sonata mr pursuant to an agreement we had with them 
we recently decided to discontinue the program to develop sonata mr 
accordingly  we intend to terminate the agreement with elan 
although we believe we are entitled to terminate the agreement  we can provide no assurance that we will effectively terminate the agreement and  if we do  under what terms 
the agreement currently requires us to pay up to an additional million if elan achieves certain milestones in connection with the development of a reformulated version of sonata and million as a milestone payment if annual net sales of a reformulated version of sonata exceed million  plus costs associated with the development of a reformulated version of sonata 
as discussed in the pt subsection of the strategic developments section  on august   we entered into a collaborative agreement with palatin to jointly develop and  on obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  commercialize palatin s pt for the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction 
in connection with this agreement  we agreed to pay potential milestone payments to palatin of up to million upon achieving certain development and regulatory approval targets 
following regulatory approval and commercialization of pt  we may also pay potential net sales milestone payments to palatin of up to million 
governmental investigations and securities litigation as previously reported  in march the sec initiated a formal investigation of king relating to  among other topics  sales of our products to vitarx and prison health services  our best price lists  the pricing of our pharmaceutical products provided to governmental medicaid agencies  the accrual and payment of rebates on the product altace  the products fluogen and lorabid  the king benevolent fund  inc  our calculations related to medicaid rebates  and the audit committee s internal review of issues raised by the sec investigation 
as also previously reported  on november   we received a subpoena duces tecum from the office of inspector general at the department of health and human services requesting the production of documents relating to some of the matters being investigated by the sec and to our sales  marketing and other business practices for altace  aplisol  and levoxyl 
more recently  we have reviewed with the staff of the sec the circumstances giving rise to the restatement of previously issued financial statements as discussed under the heading restatement of previously issued financial statements in this section 
in connection with our determination that we underpaid amounts due to medicaid and other government pricing programs from through  we have continued to engage in discussions with representatives of the sec  the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  the department of justice  the national association of medicaid fraud control units  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the department of veterans affairs  the centers for medicare medicaid services  and the public health service 
our objective in these discussions has been to achieve a comprehensive settlement relating to all the matters being investigated by or discussed with all the governmental authorities 
we have not yet reached any agreements or understandings with respect to the terms of such a settlement and may not ever be able to reach such an agreement 
however  based on the status of the discussions to date  we now believe that it is reasonably likely that we will be able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with all relevant governmental parties on the following terms we have previously accrued million in respect of our estimated underpayments to medicaid and other government pricing programs  and estimated settlement costs with all relevant governmental parties 
this amount includes million accrued for estimated underpayments to medicaid and other government pricing programs  and an additional million for estimated in the settlement costs as an operating expense during the second quarter of to cover interest  costs  fines  penalties and all other additional amounts 
our current expectation is that the aggregate cost to settle with the governmental authorities should not materially exceed the amounts already accrued 
with respect to the matters being investigated by or discussed with the staff of the sec  we currently anticipate that we would settle  without admitting or denying  one or more charges that we failed to maintain adequate books and records and internal controls 
we anticipate that the action to be settled could also include one or more charges that our public filings contained material misstatements or omissions relating to our financial results for some or all of the periods for which results have been restated as discussed under the heading restatement of previously issued financial statements in this section 
we do not anticipate being required to restate any results for periods prior to we expect that we will be required to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the department of health and human services  which would require us to submit to audits relating to our medicaid rebate calculations over a five year period 
we do not expect that the resolution of the pending investigations will result in any prohibitions on our sales to medicaid or any related state or federal program  nor do we expect any other material restriction on our ability to conduct our business  although we will be required to incur consultant fees and other expenses in order to comply with the corporate integrity agreement 
we do not expect that any criminal charges will be asserted against the company or against any present or former director  officer or employee in connection with the matters being investigated 
our ability to achieve a settlement on these or other terms is subject to substantial uncertainties 
our discussions to date have been conducted with the staffs of various agencies and other governmental authorities 
we do not yet have any agreements or understandings with any of them 
even if we were to reach such an agreement or understanding with staff personnel  it would be subject to the approval of numerous more senior representatives of the governmental parties  including the members of the us securities and exchange commission  the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  senior officials in the departments of justice  health and human services and veterans affairs  and senior officials in most or all of the states 
we expect that our agreements with the various governmental parties will also require that those governmental parties reach numerous agreements among themselves  and that the consummation of our agreement with each governmental party would be dependent on consummation of our agreements with other governmental parties 
we also expect that some aspects of a comprehensive settlement would require court approval 
in light of these uncertainties  we stress that we may not be able to reach a settlement with the governmental parties  whether on the terms described above or at all 
as a result  the ultimate amount that we will actually have to pay to resolve these matters could be materially more than the amount accrued to date  and the terms could otherwise be materially less favorable than those described above 
because of these uncertainties and the complexity of completing a comprehensive resolution  we are not yet able to estimate with reasonable confidence the amount of time that will be required to enter into and consummate comprehensive settlement agreements 
the possible settlement described above would not apply to the related pending class actions and derivative suits  or any other claims by private plaintiffs 
while we deny any liability  we are unable to predict the outcome of the class actions and derivative suits or reasonably estimate the range of loss  if any 
for additional information  please see the section entitled risk factors under the heading if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid rebate program or other governmental pricing programs  we could be subject to additional reimbursements  penalties  sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
subsequent to the announcement of the sec investigation described above  beginning in march  purported class action complaints were filed by holders of our securities against us  our directors  former directors  our executive officers  former executive officers  a subsidiary  and a former director of the subsidiary in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  alleging violations of the securities act of and or the securities exchange act of these complaints have been consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee 
in addition  holders of our securities filed two class action complaints alleging violations of the securities act of in tennessee state court 
we removed these two cases to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  where these two cases were consolidated with the other class actions 
plaintiffs in these actions unsuccessfully moved to remand these two cases back to tennessee state court 
these two actions therefore remain part of the consolidated action 
the district court has appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action  and those lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on october  alleging that we  through some of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  and former directors  made false or misleading statements concerning our business  financial condition  and results of operations during periods beginning february  and continuing until march  plaintiffs in the consolidated action have also named the underwriters of our november public offering as defendants 
we and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
on august   the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee ruled on defendants motions to dismiss 
the court dismissed all claims as to jones pharma  inc  a predecessor to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  king research and development  inc  and as to defendants dennis jones and henry richards 
the court also dismissed certain claims as to five other individual defendants 
the court denied the motions to dismiss in all other respects 
following the court s ruling  on september   we and the other remaining defendants filed answers to plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint 
discovery and other proceedings in the case are continuing  and no trial date has been set 
seven purported shareholder derivative complaints have also been filed in federal and state courts in tennessee alleging a breach of fiduciary duty  among other things  by some of our officers and directors 
on october   all of the defendants named in this action filed a partial answer to the amended consolidated derivative and class action complaint 
discovery in this action has commenced 
no trial date has been set 
another purported class action complaint was filed on august  in tennessee state court against us and the members of our board of directors 
this new case largely asserts substantially the same claims and seeks the same relief as the class action claim that was recently added to the state derivative action described above 
defendants in that action filed a motion to dismiss on november   that motion is pending and no hearing date has been set 
additionally  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee under the employee retirement income security act erisa 
as amended  the complaint alleges that we and certain of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  former directors and an employee violated fiduciary duties that they allegedly owed our k retirement savings plan s participants and beneficiaries under erisa 
the allegations underlying this action are similar in many respects to those in the class action litigation described above 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the erisa action on march  the district court judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation 
on december   the magistrate judge held a hearing on this motion  and  on december   he recommended that the district court judge dismiss the action 
the district court judge accepted the recommendation and dismissed the case on february  we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously but are unable currently to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any 
if any governmental sanctions are imposed in excess of those described above  or if we were not to prevail in the pending litigation  neither of which we can predict or reasonably estimate at this time  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
responding to the governmental investigations  resolving the amounts owed to governmental agencies in connection with the underpayments and defending us in the pending litigation has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and the payment of additional professional fees 
year ended december  we generated net cash from operations of million for the year ended december  our net cash provided from operations was primarily the result of in net loss from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization from continuing operations of million  intangible asset impairment charges from continuing operations of million  a change in deferred taxes of million and changes in working capital

certain indebtedness and other matters as of december   we had million of long term debt including current portion outstanding  up to million available under our revolving credit facility  and million available under our universal shelf registration 
on september   we registered a billion universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
this universal shelf registration statement allows us to sell any combination of debt and or equity securities in one or more offerings up to a total of billion 
during november  we completed the sale of  newly issued shares of common stock for per share per share net of commissions and expenses resulting in net proceeds of million 
additionally  during november  we issued million of convertible debentures due november  in a private placement 
holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of these debentures on november   november  or november  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrual interest up to but not including the date of repurchase 
on april   we established a million five year senior secured revolving credit facility 
the facility has been collateralized in general by all real estate with a value of million or more and all of our personal property and that of our significant subsidiaries 
our obligations under the senior secured revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by most of our subsidiaries 
the senior secured revolving credit facility accrues interest at our option  at either a the base rate  which is based on the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus one half of  plus an applicable spread ranging from to based on a leverage ratio or b the applicable libor rate plus an applicable spread ranging from to based on a leverage ratio 
in addition  the lenders under the senior secured revolving credit facility are entitled to customary facility fees based on a unused commitments under the facility and b letters of credit outstanding 
we incurred million of deferred financing costs  which are being amortized over five years  the life of the senior secured revolving credit facility 
this facility requires us to maintain a minimum net worth of no less than billion plus of our consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter after april   excluding any fiscal quarter for which consolidated income is negative  an ebitda to interest expense ratio of no less than to  and a funded debt to ebitda ratio of no greater than to prior to april  and of no greater than to on or after april  as of december   we have complied with these covenants 
as described above  on june and june   we drew down a total of million under our senior secured revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our acquisition of elan s primary care business on june  during the third quarter of  we repaid the principal balance owed on our senior secured revolving credit facility and have no outstanding borrowings as of december  as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility  however  we had million outstanding for letters of credit under this facility 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the principal capital expenditures for the year ended december  included property and equipment purchases  building improvements for facility upgrades and costs associated with improving our production capabilities  and costs associated with moving production of some of our pharmaceutical products to our facilities in st 
louis  bristol and rochester 
we anticipate capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  for the year ending december  of approximately million  which will be funded with cash from operations 
the principal capital expenditures are anticipated to include property and equipment purchases  building improvements for facility upgrades  costs associated with improving our production capabilities  and costs associated with moving production of some of our pharmaceutical products to our facilities in st 
louis  bristol and rochester 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while we have passed some price increases along to our customers  we have primarily benefited from sales growth negating most inflationary pressures 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment that requires us to expense costs related to share based payment transactions with employees 
sfas no 
r becomes mandatorily effective on july  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
requires certain abnormal expenditures to be recognized as expenses in the current period 
it also requires that the amount of fixed production overhead allocated to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for the fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effect that sfas no 
will have on our financial reporting 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates for which it is reasonably possible that a material change in estimate could occur in the near term include forecasted future cash flows used in testing for impairments of intangible and tangible assets and loss accruals for excess inventory and fixed purchase commitments under our supply contracts 
forecasted future cash flows in particular require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
in the case of impairment testing  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a material impairment charge and  whether or not they result in an immediate impairment charge  could result prospectively in a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of tangible or intangible assets  which could be material to the financial statements 
other significant estimates include accruals for medicaid and other rebates  returns and chargebacks  allowances for doubtful accounts and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy and accounting for the co promotion agreement with wyeth 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from the related estimates  and our estimates may change from time to time in response to actual developments and new information 
intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights and trademarks  patents  acquired research and development  if any  and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
however  patents have specific legal lives over which they are amortized 
conversely  trademarks and product rights have no specific legal lives 
trademarks and product rights will continue to be an asset to us after the expiration of the patent  as their economic value is not tied exclusively to the patent 
we believe that by establishing separate lives for the patent versus the trademark and product rights  we are in essence using an accelerated method of amortization for the product as a whole 
this results in greater amortization in earlier years when the product is under patent protection  as we are amortizing both the patent and the trademark and product rights  and less amortization after the product has the potential for generic competition  as the amortization on the patent is eliminated 
because we have no discernible evidence to show a decline in cash flows for trademarks and product rights  or for patents  we use the straight line method of amortization for both intangibles 
we review our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in any event  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
this evaluation is performed through our quarterly evaluation of intangibles for impairment 
further  on an annual basis  we review the life of each intangible asset and make adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future if prescriptions for  or sales of  our products are less than current expectations and result in a reduction of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
this may be caused by many factors  including competition from generic substitutes  significant delays in the manufacture of supply of materials  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials  or new legislation or regulatory proposals 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate all of our inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we provide a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed actual inventory quantities which we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 
accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for returns  chargebacks and commercial and medicaid rebates in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
at the time a rebate or chargeback payment is made or a product return is received  which occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of returns  chargebacks and rebates  the actual amount of product returns and claims for chargebacks and rebates may be different from our estimates 
our product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf life of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily based on historical sales and return rates 
we estimate our medicaid rebate and commercial contractual rebate accruals based on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and the terms of our contractual and regulatory rebate obligations 
we estimate our chargeback accrual based on our estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
our accruals for returns  chargebacks and rebates are adjusted as appropriate for specific known developments that may result in a change in our product returns or our rebate and chargeback obligations 
in the case of product returns  we monitor demand levels for our products and the effects of the introduction of competing products and other factors on this demand 
when we identify decreases in demand for products or experience higher than historical rates of returns caused by unexpected discrete events  we further analyzes these products for potential additional supplemental reserves 
accrual for rebates in thousands balance at january  net of prepaid amounts restated current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods product acquisition actual rebates ending balance  net of prepaid amounts accrual for returns in thousands balance at january restated current provision supplemental provision product acquisition actual returns ending balance accrual for chargebacks in thousands balance at january restated current provision actual chargebacks ending balance revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
for the year ended december   we deferred recognition of revenue associated with a purchase of our products by the king benevolent fund 
we have and will recognize the deferred revenue as the purchased products are distributed by the king benevolent fund 
see note  related party transactions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk 
our financial instruments are not currently subject to foreign currency risk or commodity price risk 
we have no financial instruments held for trading purposes 
we have marketable securities which are carried at fair value based on current market quotes 
gains and losses on securities are based on the specific identification method 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates rise and decrease as interest rates fall 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible debentures would be impacted by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the fair value of our long term debt would increase or decrease by approximately million 
at december   and  we did not hold any derivative financial instruments
