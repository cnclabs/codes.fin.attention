vs 
in millions revenues cable networks broadcasting segment operating income cable networks broadcasting nm revenues media networks revenues increased  or billion  to billion  consisting of a increase  or million  at the cable networks  and an increase  or million  at broadcasting 
increased cable networks revenues were primarily due to growth of million from cable and satellite operators and million in advertising revenues 
revenues from cable and satellite operators are generally derived from fees charged on a per subscriber basis  and the increase in the current year was due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth at espn and the disney channels 
increased advertising revenue was due to higher rates at espn and higher ratings at abc family 
the company s contractual arrangements with cable and satellite operators are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
a number of these arrangements are currently in negotiation 
consolidation in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable and satellite programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place 
if this were to occur  revenues from cable networks could increase at slower rates than in the past or could stabilize or decline 
certain of the company s existing contracts with cable and satellite operators as well as contracts in negotiation include annual live programming commitments 
in these cases  revenues subject to the commitment  which are collected ratably over the year  are deferred until the annual commitments are satisfied which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year 
increased broadcasting revenues were due to growth at the abc television network and television production and distribution 
abc television network revenues increased primarily due to higher primetime advertising revenue resulting from higher ratings and advertising rates 
the growth at television production and distribution was driven by higher license fee revenues from domestic markets as a result of the syndication of my wife and kids and higher revenue in international markets from sales of desperate housewives and lost 
costs and expenses costs and expenses  which consist primarily of programming rights costs  production costs  participation costs  distribution and marketing expenses  labor costs and general and administrative costs  increased  or million  to billion consisting of an increase  or million  at the cable networks  and a increase  or million  at broadcasting 
the increase at cable networks was driven by increases at espn from higher general and administrative expenses  increased production costs and investments in new business initiatives  including espn branded mobile phone service 
higher general and administrative expenses  programming expenses and marketing costs at the disney channels also contributed to the increase at cable networks 
the increase at broadcasting was driven by higher production and participation costs at tv production and distribution 
the adoption of sfas r increased expenses in fiscal year at cable networks and at broadcasting by million and million  respectively 
sports programming costs the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of television rights for sports and other programming  including the nba  nfl  mlb  and various college football and basketball conferences and football bowl games 
the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years 
we enter into these contractual commitments with the expectation that  over the life of the contracts  revenue from advertising during the programming and affiliate fees will exceed the costs of the programming 
while contract costs may initially exceed incremental revenues and negatively impact operating income  it is our expectation that the combined value to our networks from all of these contracts will result in long term benefits 
the actual impact of these contracts on the company s results over the term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences 
the initial five year period of the company s contract to televise nfl games was non cancelable and ended with the telecast of the pro bowl 
in february  the nfl did not exercise its renegotiation option and as a result  the company s nfl contract was extended for an additional three years ending with the telecast of the pro bowl 
the aggregate fee for the three year period is billion 
espn recognized its portion of the costs of the initial five year term of the contract at levels that increased each year commensurate with expected increases in nfl revenues 
as a result  espn experienced its highest level of nfl programming costs during fiscal the implementation of the contract extension resulted in a million reduction in nfl programming costs at espn in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of this decrease was in the first quarter of fiscal these costs were relatively level in fiscal and will remain relatively level in fiscal cash payments under the contract were billion for fiscal and fiscal the company entered into a new agreement with the nfl for the right to broadcast nfl monday night football games on espn 
the contract provides for total payments of approximately billion over an eight year period  commencing with the season 
the payment terms of the new contract provide for average increases in the annual payments of approximately per year 
we expect that our expense recognition of the costs of the new contract will reflect this payment schedule 
the company has rights to games in the season  which begins in the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year additionally  subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  the company entered into an eight year agreement with nascar pursuant to which abc and espn will have the right to televise certain nascar races and related programming beginning in the agreement is subject to termination by the espn and nascar boards of directors through december  segment operating income segment operating income increased  or million  to billion for the year due to an increase of million at the cable networks and an increase of million at broadcasting 
the increase at cable networks was due to growth at espn from higher affiliate revenues and advertising revenues  partially offset by higher costs and expenses at espn 
the increase at broadcasting was driven by higher primetime advertising revenues at the abc television network and higher license fee revenues from syndication of my wife and kids and international sales of lost and desperate housewives at television production and distribution

pension and benefit costs pension and post retirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments  with the majority of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment

we expect pension and post retirement medical costs to increase to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate assumption from to  reflecting decreases in prevailing market interest rates on our june  valuation date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
the company s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 
during fiscal  the company contributed million to its pension and postretirement medical plans which included voluntary contributions above the minimum requirements for the pension plans 
the company currently expects to contribute  at a minimum  million to its pension and postretirement medical plans during fiscal the company may make additional contributions into its pension plans in fiscal depending on how the funded status of those plans change and also depending on the outcome of proposed changes to the funding regulations currently being considered by the united states congress 
due to an increase in the present value of pension obligations  pension obligations exceed plan assets for a number of our pension plans 
in this situation  the accounting rules require that we record an additional minimum pension liability 
the additional minimum pension liability adjustment at year end fiscal and fiscal is as follows minimum liability at fiscal year end increase in pretax aftertax the increase in the additional minimum pension liability in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate from to 
the accounting rules do not require that changes in the additional minimum pension liability adjustment be recorded in current period earnings  but rather they are recorded directly to equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
expense recognition under the pension accounting rules is based upon long term trends over the expected life of the company s workforce

effective income tax rate ppt the effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the fiscal effective income tax rate is primarily due to tax reserve adjustments including a million reserve release as a result of the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax issues 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during the year ended october  the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities cash used by investing activities cash used by financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operations decreased or million  to billion  driven by the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as higher income tax payments and pension contributions 
these decreases were partially offset by higher pre tax income adjusted for non cash items 
the company s studio and media networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming 
film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films  animated direct to video programming  television series  television specials  theatrical stage plays or other similar product 
programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the company s broadcast  cable networks and television stations 
programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities 
accordingly  we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability 
the company s film and television production and programming activity for the fiscal years ended  and are as follows in millions beginning balances production and programming assets programming liabilities spending film and television production broadcast programming amortization film and television production broadcast programming change in film and television production and programming costs other non cash activity ending balances production and programming assets programming liabilities investing activities investing activities consist principally of investments in parks  resorts and other property and mergers  acquisition and divestiture activity

the international park spending in primarily reflects hong kong disneyland construction costs where capital expenditures totaled million compared to the prior year amount of million which includes only six months of activity 
our equity partner contributed million in fiscal and million in the second half of fiscal  which are included as sources of cash in financing activities 
capital spending at hong kong disneyland is expected to decrease in fiscal as the theme park opened in september capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers  production facilities and television station facilities 
corporate and unallocated shared capital expenditures were primarily for information technology software and hardware

other activity included a million reduction of euro disney senior debt using cash security deposits and a million decrease due to foreign currency translation as a result of the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro 
the company s bank facilities are as follows committed capacity unused in millions capacity used capacity bank facilities expiring bank facilities expiring total these bank facilities allow for borrowings at libor based rates plus a spread  which depends on the company s public debt rating and can range from to 
as of october   the company had not borrowed under these bank facilities 
the company also has the ability to issue up to million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in  which if utilized  reduces available borrowing 
as of october   letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million had been issued under this facility 
the company expects to use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities  in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow  to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due 
on january   the company filed a shelf registration statement which allows the company to borrow up to billion using various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes  us dollar or foreign currency denominated notes  redeemable notes  global notes and dual currency or other indexed notes 
the company subsequently established a domestic medium term note program under this shelf registration  which permits issuance of billion of debt instruments  of which none have been issued at october  in addition to the shelf  the company also has a european medium term note program  which permits issuance of approximately billion of additional debt instruments  of which billion has been utilized at october  the company declared an annual dividend of per share on december  related to fiscal the dividend is payable on january  to shareholders of record on december  the company paid a million dividend per share during the second quarter of fiscal applicable to fiscal  paid a million dividend per share during the second quarter of fiscal applicable to fiscal  and paid a million dividend per share during the first quarter of fiscal applicable to fiscal during fiscal  the company repurchased million shares of disney common stock for billion 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million shares of disney common stock for approximately million 
no shares of disney common stock were repurchased during fiscal as of october   the company had authorization to repurchase approximately million additional shares  of which the company has repurchased million shares for billion subsequent to year end through december  we believe that the company s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control 
in addition to macroeconomic factors  the company s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which are based  in significant part  on the company s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of october   moody s investors service s long and short term debt ratings for the company were baal and p  respectively  with positive outlook for the long term rating  and standard poor s long and short term debt ratings for the company were a and a  respectively  with stable outlook 
the company s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant  relating to interest coverage  which the company met on october   by a significant margin 
the company s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities  including euro disney and hong kong disneyland  from any representations  covenants or events of default 
hong kong disneyland is subject to financial covenants under its loan agreements beginning in fiscal year euro disney has covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investing and financing activities 
beginning with fiscal year  euro disney must meet financial performance covenants that will necessitate earnings growth 
management currently expects operating results to be sufficient to meet these covenants 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing financial covenants will be met at any given time in the future 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis at october  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in footnotes to the financial statements  as referenced in the table payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years borrowings note operating lease commitments note capital lease obligations note sports programming commitments note broadcast programming commitments note total sports and other broadcast programming commitments other total contractual obligations amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling million  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates for variable rate debt 
other commitments primarily comprise creative talent and employment agreements including obligations to actors  producers  sports personnel  television and radio personalities and executives 
comprised of the following liabilities recorded on the balance sheet commitments not recorded on the balance sheet the company also has obligations with respect to its pension and post retirement medical benefit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contingent commitments and contingencies the company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require the company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur contingent commitments 
the company does not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any amounts being paid by the company 
contractual guarantees see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s contractual guarantees 
information technology outsourcing during the year  the company entered into agreements with two suppliers to outsource certain information technology functions and support services 
the transition of services to the new suppliers began in late july the terms of these agreements extend five to seven years with an option for the company to extend for an additional two to three years 
the company will retain all responsibility and authority for systems architecture  technology strategy  and product standards under the agreements 
payments under these agreements are excluded from the table above because the payments vary depending on usage  but the company anticipates spending approximately billion for these services over the next seven years  which is less than what we estimate we would have spent had we not outsourced these functions 
dvd manufacturing arrangement the company has a sole source arrangement in the united states and a number of international markets with a third party manufacturer to meet the company s dvd manufacturing and warehousing requirements which expires december  payments under this arrangement are excluded from the table above since there are neither fixed nor minimum quantities under the arrangement 
total payments for fiscal were approximately billion 
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters 
accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
film and television revenues and costs we expense the cost of film and television production and participations as well as certain multi year sports rights over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues or on a straight line basis  as appropriate 
these estimates are calculated on an individual production basis for film and television and on an individual contract basis for sports rights 
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly due to a variety of factors  including advertising rates  the level of market acceptance of the production and trends in consumer behavior 
for film productions  estimated remaining gross revenue from all sources includes revenue that will be earned within ten years of the date of the initial theatrical release 
for television series  we include revenues that will be earned within ten years of the delivery of the first episode  or if still in production  five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode  if later 
for acquired film libraries  remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to twenty years from the date of acquisition 
television network and station rights for theatrical movies  series and other programs are charged to expense based on the number of times the program is expected to be shown 
estimates of usage of television network and station programming can change based on competition and audience acceptance 
accordingly  revenue estimates and planned usage are reviewed periodically and are revised if necessary 
a change in revenue projections or planned usage could have an impact on our results of operations 
costs of film and television productions and programming costs for our television and cable networks are subject to valuation adjustments pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology 
a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type 
the company s dayparts are early morning  daytime  late night  primetime  news  children and sports includes network and cable 
the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel 
estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  film  television and programming cost write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments  which are appropriate to the circumstances of each business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies 
we record reductions to revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise  primarily home video  dvd and software products  and for customer programs and sales incentives 
these estimates are based upon historical return experience  current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products 
if we underestimate the level of returns in a particular period  we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the predicted amount 
conversely  if we overestimate the level of returns for a period  we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than predicted 
revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used 
for non expiring  multi day tickets and tickets sold through bulk distribution channels  we recognize revenue based on estimated usage patterns which are derived from historical usage patterns 
a change in these estimated usage patterns could have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we decreased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions at our june  measurement date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
the company s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 
a one percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense for fiscal by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october  by billion  respectively 
a one percent increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease these amounts by million and million  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
our long term expected return on plan assets was in both and  respectively 
a one percent change in the long term return on pension plan asset assumption would impact fiscal annual pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and investments statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed our impairment testing as of october  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the implementation of emerging issues task force topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill eitf d  as described under accounting changes below 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas we established the following reporting units cable networks  television broadcasting  radio  studio entertainment  consumer products and parks and resorts 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flow corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate  except for the television network  a business within the television broadcasting reporting unit 
the television broadcasting reporting unit includes the television network and the owned and operated television stations 
these businesses have been grouped together because their respective cash flows are dependent on one another 
for purposes of our impairment test  we used a revenue multiple to value the television network 
we did not use a present value technique or a market multiple approach to value the television network as a present value technique would not capture the full fair value of the television network and there is little comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks 
we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of the reporting units 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  the impairment test results could differ 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
the company has cost and equity investments 
the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of our investees 
if these forecasts are not met  impairment charges may be required 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 
income tax audits as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reached settlements with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal income tax returns for through  and a settlement with the california franchise tax board regarding assessments proposed with respect to its state tax returns for through these favorable settlements resulted in the company releasing million in tax reserves which are no longer required with respect to these matters 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal income tax returns for through the favorable settlement resulted in the company releasing million in tax reserves that are no longer required with respect to these matters 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company favorably resolved certain state income tax audit issues and released million of related tax reserves 
stock option compensation expense compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes model were  and years for the expected term and  and for the expected volatility for fiscal years  and  respectively 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r see note to the consolidated financial statements  the company reviewed and updated  among other things  its forfeiture  expected term and volatility assumptions 
the weighted average expected option term for reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which was issued in march the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
estimated volatility for fiscal also reflects the application of sab interpretive guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical and implied share price volatility  with implied volatility derived from exchange traded options on the company s common stock and other traded financial instruments  such as the company s convertible debt 
volatility for and was estimated based upon historical share price volatility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information

 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires that new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  such as stock options and restricted stock  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the company adopted sfas r effective october   using the modified retrospective method 
this method allows the restatement of interim financial statements in the year of adoption based on the amounts previously calculated and reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures required by sfas however  fiscal years prior to have not been restated 
the adoption of sfas r in fiscal resulted in the recognition of stock option expense of million and million of net capitalized compensation costs  a reduction in net income of million net of tax benefits of million  a reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share of  a reduction of million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of million in cash flows from financing activities

accordingly  compensation expense for stock option awards was generally not recognized in the consolidated statements of income

sfas and sop in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions sfas 
the fasb issued this statement as a result of guidance provided in american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions sop  which applies to all real estate time sharing transactions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we expect that the impact of adoption will not be material to our financial statements 
fin r in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
variable interest entities vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes 
in connection with the adoption of fin r  the company concluded that euro disney and hong kong disneyland are vies and that we are the primary beneficiary 
as a result  the company began consolidating euro disney and hong kong disneyland s balance sheets on march   the end of the company s second quarter of fiscal  and the income and cash flow statements beginning april   the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal under fin r transition rules  the operating results of euro disney and hong kong disneyland continued to be accounted for on the equity method for the six months ended march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have concluded that the rest of our equity investments do not require consolidation as either they are not vies  or in the event that they are vies  we are not the primary beneficiary 
the company also has variable interests in certain other vies that have not been consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary 
these vies do not involve any material exposure to the company 
eitf the company adopted eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  effective at the beginning of fiscal eitf addresses revenue recognition for revenues derived from a single contractual arrangement that contains multiple products or services 
the rule provides additional requirements to determine when such revenues may be recorded separately for accounting purposes 
previously  the company had recognized the nfl broadcast portion of espn s affiliate revenue when the nfl games were aired  as espn s affiliate contracts provided a basis for allocating such revenue between nfl and non nfl programming 
since the cost of the nfl rights had also been recognized as the games were aired  the company recognized both the nfl revenues and nfl costs in the quarters the games were aired 
under eitf s requirements for separating the revenue elements of a single contract  beginning in fiscal the company no longer allocates espn s affiliate revenue between nfl and non nfl programming for accounting purposes 
as a consequence  the company no longer matches all nfl revenue with nfl costs  as espn affiliate revenue including the nfl portion is generally recognized ratably throughout the year  while nfl contract costs continue to be recognized in the quarters the games are aired 
this accounting change impacts only the timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on cash flow 
as a result of this change  the media networks segment reports significantly reduced revenue and profitability in the first fiscal quarter when the majority of the nfl games are aired  with commensurately increased revenues and profits in the second and third fiscal quarters 
the company elected to adopt this new accounting rule using the cumulative effect approach and recorded an after tax charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting as of the beginning of fiscal year this amount represented the revenue recorded for nfl games in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which has been recorded ratably over fiscal under the new accounting method

forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our shareholders 
such statements may  for example  express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take  including restructuring or strategic initiatives  or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions 
these statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements 
there can be no assurance  however  that our expectations will necessarily come to pass 
significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item a risk factors of this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company s portfolio of borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues 
the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  transactions 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
cross currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk var the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and market sensitive equity financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates  currencies and equity prices a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate  foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end fiscal the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
var on a combined basis decreased from million at september  to million at october  the majority of the decrease is due to lower volatility and a lower market value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  is as follows unaudited  in millions interest rate currency sensitive sensitive equity sensitive financial financial financial combined fiscal year instruments instruments instruments portfolio year end var average var highest var lowest var beginning of year var year end fiscal the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of october  in calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disney s debt rather than interest rate risks 
accordingly  we have excluded euro disney s borrowings from the var calculation
