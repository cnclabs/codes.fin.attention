item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the ten largest truckload carriers in the united states measured by revenue according to transport topics  a publication of the american trucking associations 
we focus on targeted markets where we believe our service standards can provide a competitive advantage 
we are a major carrier for transportation companies such as freight forwarders  less than truckload carriers  and third party logistics providers that require a high level of service to support their businesses as well as for traditional truckload customers such as manufacturers and retailers 
recent results and year end financial condition for the year ended december   total revenue increased  to million from million during freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  increased  to million in from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year compared with million  or per diluted share  for excluding a non cash increase to claims reserves  net income for the year was million  or per diluted share 
excluding the increase to reserves  we achieved the best operating ratio which we define as operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of freight revenue and highest earnings and earnings per share of any year since we believe the improvements in our profitability excluding the increase to reserves were attributable primarily to the continued execution of our operating strategy  which involves allocating our equipment to customers and freight that provide the most favorable returns 
the most significant components of this effort were raising rates  expanding our dedicated business  and continuing to shift assets toward shorter lengths of haul  particularly in our regional truckload operations 
our efforts were aided by stronger freight demand and a better rate environment in primarily due to continued growth in the us economy and a favorable relationship between demand and trucking capacity 
as a result  average freight revenue per loaded mile  increased per mile to  a increase compared with the increase in average freight revenue per loaded mile was offset partially by an increase in our percentage of non revenue miles and a decrease in average miles per tractor  both related to a decrease in average length of haul to miles and a decrease in the percentage of our fleet comprised of team driven tractors 
average freight revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  improved by  to  in compared with  for these factors more than offset a significant increase in costs  primarily attributable to increased costs of driver compensation  revenue equipment  insurance and claims  and fuel 
our operating ratio  excluding the increase to claims reserves  improved to for compared with for at december   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholder s equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio of and a book value of per share 
in addition  during december we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to million  lower our interest rate grid  and extend the term for five years 
at december   we had a combined million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and securitization facility 
non gaap reconciliation the net income and earnings per diluted share results that exclude the increase to claims reserves are non gaap measures 
management believes these measures provide an alternative presentation of results that more accurately reflects our on going operations  without the distorting effect of the non cash adjustment 
these measures should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  net income and earnings per diluted share 
the following table reconciles net income and earnings per diluted share  excluding the adjustment charge  to net income and earnings per diluted share calculated in accordance with gaap  which includes the adjustment numbers in thousands  except per share twelve months ended december  net income per share net income and earnings per diluted share  excluding increase to claims reserves after tax increase to claims reserves  total and per share net income and earnings per diluted share 
table of contents increase to claims reserves during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash  after tax increase to claims reserves of million  or per diluted share 
between and  we increased our primary retention amounts from  per occurrence for workers compensation and casualty claims to million for workers compensation and million for casualty claims 
later during that period  we experienced substantial increases in the frequency of accidents and workers compensation claims 
because of the significant increases in our retention amounts and in the frequency of claims  we engaged an independent third party actuary as part of our process of assessing our claims reserve estimates 
based on the actuarial report and our own evaluation  we recorded an aggregate million pre tax adjustment to our claims reserves during the fourth quarter of the adjustment included an million increase to our casualty reserve  which was reflected in insurance and claims on our consolidated statement of operations  and a million increase to our workers compensation reserve  which was reflected in salaries  wages  and benefits on our consolidated statement of operations 
the actuary also recommended a range of future accrual rates for workers compensation and casualty claims 
the expected range for workers compensation accruals going forward is consistent with the rates we used over the last two years 
this expense is recorded in salaries  wages and related expenses in our income statement 
the expected range for casualty accruals going forward is between and per mile including premiums  which would be approximately to of freight revenue based on our fourth quarter results 
the expected range for future accruals is based on our historical incident trends 
our actual future accrual rates will depend on a number of factors  including the frequency and severity of claims and our self insured retention amounts 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver availability  and our average length of haul 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
prior to  we measured freight revenue  before fuel and accessorial surcharges  in addition to total revenue 
in  we reclassified accessorial revenue  other than fuel surcharges  into freight revenue  and our historical financial statements have been conformed to this presentation 
we continue to report fuel surcharge revenue separately 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment and operating terminals 
we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel 
the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past three years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the united states economy has expanded  many trucking companies have been able to raise freight rates to cover the increased costs 
this is primarily due to industry wide tight capacity of tractors and trailers  which in general has arisen because many fleets have stated they will not add equipment until margins improve 
in addition  competition for drivers has become increasingly intense  as the expanding economy has provided alternative jobs at the same time as increasing freight demand 
to obtain capacity  shippers have been willing to accept the largest rate increases in recent memory 
as long as freight demand continues to exceed truck capacity  we expect increases in driver pay by many carriers  which we may do as well  and higher freight rates 

table of contents revenue equipment we operate approximately  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors  at december   approximately  were owned   were financed under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers  at december   approximately  were owned and approximately  were financed under operating leases 
we recognized pre tax impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of in relation to the reduced value of our model year through tractors 
in addition  we increased the depreciation rate and decreased salvage values on our remaining tractors to reflect our expectations concerning market value at disposition 
our assumptions represent management s best estimate  and actual values could differ by the time those tractors are scheduled for trade 
because of the increases in purchase prices and lower residual values  the annual expense per tractor on model year and tractors is expected to be higher than the annual expense on the units being replaced 
we finance a portion of our tractor fleet and most of our trailer fleet with off balance sheet operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers 
in april  we entered into a sale leaseback arrangement covering approximately  of our trailers 
this arrangement is more fully described below in the revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation discussion 
we changed our process on our tractor trade cycle from a period of approximately four years to three years 
we evaluated the decision based on maintenance costs  capital requirements  prices of new and used tractors  and other factors 
this resulted in substantial capital expenditures in and and lower maintenance expense in independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
the payments to independent contractors and the financing of equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using net margin as well as operating ratio 
outlook looking forward  our profitability goal is to return to an operating ratio of approximately 
we expect this to require additional improvements in revenue per tractor per week  particularly in revenue per mile  to overcome expected additional cost increases to expand our margins 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
for  the key factors that we expect to have the greatest effects on our profitability are our freight revenue per tractor per week  our compensation of drivers  our cost of revenue equipment  our fuel costs  and our insurance and claims expense 
we expect our costs for driver compensation to increase in connection with an expected two cent per mile increase for employee drivers and a four cent per mile increase for our independent contractor drivers in march and an additional one cent per mile increase for our team drivers in april 
to overcome these cost increases and improve our margins  we will need to achieve significant increases in freight revenue per tractor  particularly in revenue per mile 
operationally  we will seek improvements in safety  driver recruiting and retention  and executing our regional truckload business 
our success in these areas primarily will affect revenue  driver related expenses  and insurance and claims expense 
we believe that improving our regional truckload service offers the largest opportunity for improving our profitability 

table of contents results of operations for comparison purposes in the table below  we use freight revenue  or total revenue less fuel surcharges  in addition to total revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe excluding this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue excludes million  million and million of fuel surcharges in each of   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to total revenue and freight revenue total revenue freight revenue operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses fuel expense fuel expense operations and maintenance operations and maintenance revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims insurance and claims communications and utilities communications and utilities general supplies and expenses general supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization  including gains losses on disposition of equipment and impairment of assets depreciation and amortization  including gains losses on disposition of equipment and impairment of assets total operating expenses total operating expenses operating income operating income other expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes income before income taxes income tax expense income tax expense net income net income freight revenue is total revenue less fuel surcharges

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in freight revenue excludes million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million in for comparison purposes in the discussion below  we use freight revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe removing this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharges increased million  to million in  from million in revenue per tractor per week  a key statistic that we use to evaluate our asset productivity  increased to  in from  in our revenue per tractor per week increase was primarily generated by a increase in average freight revenue per loaded mile which was partially offset by lower miles per tractor and an increase in our percentage of non revenue miles 
our rates have increased primarily due to a strong freight market  tightened truck capacity  a decrease in our average length of haul  and an improvement in our freight selection 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until fleet production and profitability improve 
salaries  wages  and related expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses increased to in  from in driver pay increased million  to of freight revenue in from of freight revenue in the increase was largely attributable to pay increases and new retention bonus programs 
driver wages are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  due to a planned two cent per mile pay increase that will go into effect march and an additional one cent per mile pay increase for team drivers in april if the shortage of qualified drivers continues  additional driver pay increases may be necessary in the future 
our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers remained relatively constant at of freight revenue in and of freight revenue in health insurance  employer paid taxes  workers compensation  and other employee benefits remained essentially constant at of freight revenue in and of freight revenue in workers compensation expense increased in and during the fourth quarter of  we incurred a million non cash increase to our workers compensation claims reserves as a result of a change of estimated ultimate liability 
in  we incurred an approximately  claim relating to a natural gas explosion in our indianapolis terminal that injured four employees 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  remained constant at million in and million in fuel prices increased sharply during and remained at high levels in as a percentage of freight revenue  net fuel expense remained relatively constant at in and fuel surcharges amounted to per revenue mile in and per revenue mile in  which partially offset the increased fuel expense 
fuel costs may be affected in the future by price fluctuations  volume purchase commitments  the terms and collectibility of fuel surcharges  the percentage of miles driven by independent contractors  and lower fuel mileage due to government mandated emissions standards that have resulted in less fuel efficient engines 
at december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
operations and maintenance  which consist primarily of vehicle maintenance  repairs and driver recruitment expenses  decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance expense decreased to of freight revenue from in the decrease resulted in part from the implementation of our equipment plan to change our four year tractor trade cycle back to a period of approximately three years  which has reduced the average age of our tractor fleet 
accordingly  maintenance costs have decreased 
the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets decreased substantially during and remained relatively low during at december   the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets was approximately and months  respectively 
the maintenance savings are expected to be partially offset by increased driver recruiting expense due to the greater demand for trucking services and a tighter supply of drivers 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation remained essentially constant at million and million in during  revenue equipment rental expense increased and was offset by a decrease in purchased transportation 
revenue equipment rental expense increased million  or  to million in from million in as we financed more equipment under operating leases 
as of december  we had financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases as compared to tractors and  trailers under operating leases as of december payments to independent contractors decreased million to million in from million in  mainly due to a decrease in the independent contractor fleet to an average of during versus an average of in we have experienced difficulty in retaining our independent contractors due to the challenging operating conditions 
in an effort to retain and attract more independent contractors  we have planned a four cents per mile increase that will go into effect march payments due to independent contractors could increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods if the independent contractor fleet remains at its current level 

table of contents operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at million in and million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in and in insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance and claims expense increased to in from in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million non cash increase to our reserves for casualty claims 
excluding the effect of that adjustment  insurance and claims was of freight revenue in and of freight revenue in insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense  and the level of self insured retention and may cause our insurance and claims expense to be higher or more volatile in future periods than in historical periods 
communications and utilities decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in and in general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  general supplies and expenses remained essentially constant at in and in an increase in public company expenses relating to sarbanes oxley requirements affected this category of expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in the increase primarily related to trade in preparation costs and losses on the sale of equipment 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the value of owned revenue equipment being depreciated due to more equipment being leased instead of purchased 
to the extent equipment is leased under operating leases  the amounts will be reflected in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the disposal of tractors and trailers 
loss on the disposal of tractors and trailers was approximately million in compared to a gain of million in other expense  net  increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  other expense remained essentially constant at in and in the increase is due to a million interest charge related to a proposed disallowed irs transaction and higher interest expense 
these increases were partially offset by a million pre tax  non cash gain in related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
 compared to a gain of million in the other expense category includes interest expense  interest income  and pre tax non cash gains or losses related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due to permanent differences related to a per diem pay structure implemented in due to the nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates 
as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of the foregoing  our net margin decreased to in from in excluding the million non cash  after tax increase to claims reserves  net income increased million  or  to million  for a net margin of 

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in freight revenue excludes million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million in for comparison purposes in the discussion below  we use freight revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe removing this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue increased million  to million in  from million in revenue per tractor per week increased to  in from  in the revenue per tractor per week increase was primarily generated by a higher rate per loaded mile which was partially offset by an increase in non revenue miles 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until fleet production and profitability improve 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased to in  from in the decrease was largely attributable to our utilizing a larger percentage of single driver tractors  with only one driver per tractor to be compensated and implementing changes in our pay structure 
driver wages are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  due to a pay increase that will go into effect march  management expects wages to increase approximately three cents per mile or approximately million pre tax on an annualized basis 
our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers remained relatively constant at of freight revenue in and of freight revenue in health insurance  employer paid taxes  workers compensation  and other employee benefits decreased to of freight revenue in from of freight revenue in  mainly due to improving claims experience in our workers compensation plan 
as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses was impacted during the year in part by an approximately  claim relating to a natural gas explosion in our indianapolis terminal that injured four employees  which was partially offset by favorable workers compensation experience otherwise 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  remained constant at million in and as a percentage of freight revenue  net fuel expense remained relatively constant at in and in fuel prices increased sharply during due to unrest in venezuela and the middle east and low inventories 
however  fuel surcharges amounted to 
per loaded mile in compared to 
per loaded mile in  which partially offset the increased fuel expense 
higher fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 
fuel costs may be affected in the future by volume purchase commitments  the collectibility of fuel surcharges  and lower fuel mileage due to government mandated emissions standards that were effective october   and have resulted in less fuel efficient engines 
operations and maintenance consist primarily of vehicle maintenance  repairs and driver recruitment expenses 
operations and maintenance increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance expense remained relatively constant at in and we extended the trade cycle on our tractor fleet from three years to four years in  which resulted in an increase in the number of required repairs during the first half of we are in the process of changing our tractor trade cycle back to a period of approximately three years  and we expect maintenance costs to decrease as the reduced maintenance cost of the new tractors is no longer offset by the high cost of preparing used tractors for disposition 
the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets decreased to and months at december  from and months as of december  respectively 
driver recruiting expense is expected to increase because of greater demand for trucking services and a tighter supply of drivers 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to in from in the increase is due principally to two factors 
first  the revenue equipment rental expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in as of december  we had financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases as compared to tractors and  trailers under operating leases as of december on april   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving approximately  dry van trailers 
we sold the trailers to a finance company for approximately million in cash and leased the trailers back under three year walk away leases 
the approximately million gain on the sale leaseback transaction will be amortized over the life of the lease 
also in april  we entered into an agreement with a finance company to sell approximately  dry van trailers for approximately million in cash and to lease  model year dry van trailers over the next twelve months 
the leases on the new trailers are seven year walk away leases 
the approximately million loss on the dry van transaction will be recognized with additional depreciation expense from the date of the transaction until the units are sold 
our revenue equipment rental expense is expected to increase in the future to reflect these transactions  which will be partially offset by no longer recognizing depreciation and interest expense with respect to these trailers or tractors 
in addition  in september  we entered into an agreement with volvo for the lease with an option to purchase of up to new tractors  with these units being leased under month walk away leases 
the increase in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation is also due to the payments to independent contractors increasing million to million in from million in  mainly due to an increase in the independent contractor fleet to an average of in versus an average of in payments due to independent contractors are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  due to the approximately three cents per mile increase in compensation to independent contractors that will go into effect march  the financial impact will be approximately million pretax on an annualized basis 

table of contents operating taxes and licenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in and in insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance and claims expense increased to in from in insurance and claims expense has increased greatly since the increase is a result of an industry wide increase in insurance rates  which we addressed by adopting an insurance program with significantly higher deductible exposure  and our unfavorable accident experience over the past three years 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense  and the level of self insured retention 
because of another increase in self insured retentions  effective march   our future expenses of insurance and claims may be higher or more volatile than in historical periods 
communications and utilities increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in and general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  general supplies and expenses remained essentially constant at in and in depreciation  amortization and impairment charge  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in the decrease in part resulted because we did not have an impairment charge in the period  as we recorded a million impairment charge in the period 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the disposal of tractors and trailers 
gains on the disposal of tractors and trailers were approximately million in compared to a loss of million in in addition  we executed the april sale leaseback transaction  discussed under the revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation discussion above 
these factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense on our tractors and on our new tractors 
we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership and or leasing to increase in future periods 
the increase is expected to result from a combination of higher initial prices of new equipment  lower resale values for used equipment  and increased depreciation expense on some of our existing equipment over their remaining lives in order to better match expected book values or lease residual values with market values at the equipment disposal date 
to the extent equipment is leased under operating leases  the amounts will be reflected in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
to the extent equipment is owned or obtained under capitalized leases  the amounts will be reflected as depreciation expense and interest expense 
those expense items will fluctuate with changes in the percentage of our equipment obtained under operating leases versus owned and under capitalized leases 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from five acquisitions 
goodwill amortization ceased beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 and we evaluate goodwill and certain intangibles for impairment  annually 
during the second quarter of and  we tested our goodwill for impairment and found no impairment 
other expense  net  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  other expense decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower debt balances and more favorable interest rates 
included in the other expense category are interest expense  interest income  and pre tax non cash adjustments related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
 which amounted to a million gain in and a million loss in during the first quarter of  we prepaid the remaining million in previously outstanding ten year  private placement notes with borrowings from the credit agreement 
in conjunction with the prepayment of the borrowings  we recognized an approximate million pre tax charge to reflect the early extinguishment of debt 
the losses related to the write off of debt issuance and other deferred financing costs and a premium paid on the retirement of the notes 
upon adoption of sfas in  we reclassified the loss and it is no longer classified as an extraordinary item 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due to permanent differences related to a per diem pay structure implemented in due to the nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of the foregoing  our net margin increased to in from in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business requires significant capital investments 
in recent years  we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under credit facilities  cash flows from operations  and long term operating leases 
our primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  proceeds under the securitization facility and borrowings under our credit agreement  each as defined in notes and to our consolidated financial statements contained herein  and operating leases of revenue equipment 
over the past several years  we have financed a large and increasing percentage of our revenue equipment through operating leases 
this has reduced the net value of revenue equipment reflected on our balance sheet  reduced our borrowings  and increased our net cash flows compared to purchasing all of our revenue equipment 
certain items could fluctuate depending on whether we finance our revenue equipment through borrowings or through operating leases 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of trade ins  to be approximately to million in  exclusive of acquisitions of companies  assuming all revenue equipment is purchased 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and projected needs for at least the next twelve months 
on a longer term basis  based on anticipated future cash flows  expected availability under our credit agreement and securitization facility  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in our primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income increased by depreciation and amortization 
net income decreased in due to a million pre tax insurance adjustment and we experienced increases in receivables associated with detention accessorial revenue 
our number of days sales in accounts receivable increased to days in from days in due to difficulty in resolving and collecting detention accessorial revenue related to the hours of service regulations that went into effect in net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash was used was primarily for the acquisition of new revenue equipment net of trade ins using proceeds from the credit agreement 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in  primarily to reduce debt 
during  we reduced outstanding balance sheet debt by million 
during  we reduced our outstanding balance sheet debt by million  which included million of proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million  consisting of million in the securitization facility and million drawn under the credit agreement 
we also repaid a million interest bearing note to the former primary stockholder of srt in september in addition  we used approximately million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock 
in may  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan for up to million company shares to be purchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions subject to criteria established by the board 
during  we purchased a total of  shares with an average price of 
the stock repurchase plan expires may  material debt agreements in december  we amended and restated our credit agreement with a group of banks 
the facility matures in december borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate  which floats daily  or libor  which accrues interest based on one  two  three  or six month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on a consolidated leverage ratio 
the applicable margin was at december  at december   we had only libor borrowings in the amount of million outstanding on which the interest rate was 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and all of our subsidiaries except cvti receivables corp 
and volunteer insurance limited 
the credit agreement has a maximum borrowing limit of million with an accordion feature which permits an increase up to a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or the maximum borrowing limit 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement is secured by a pledge of the stock of all of the subsidiaries that guaranty the credit agreement 
a commitment fee  that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on consolidated leverage ratio  is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement with approximately million of available borrowing capacity 
at december  and december   we had undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  consolidated leverage ratio  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness and is cross defaulted with the securitization facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with the credit agreement covenants 

table of contents in december  we entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility 
on a revolving basis  we sell our interests in our accounts receivable to crc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary 
crc sells a percentage ownership in such receivables to an unrelated financial entity 
we can receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible receivables  and pay a service fee recorded as interest expense  based on commercial paper interest rates plus an applicable margin of per annum and a commitment fee of per annum on the daily unused portion of the facility 
the net proceeds under the securitization facility are required to be shown as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
as of december  and december   we had received million and million  respectively  in proceeds  with a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
crc does not meet the requirements for off balance sheet accounting  therefore  it is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the securitization facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  consolidated leverage ratio  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness and is cross defaulted 
as of december   we were in compliance with the securitization facility covenants 
sale leaseback transactions in april  we engaged in a sale leaseback transaction involving approximately  dry van trailers 
we sold the trailers to a finance company for approximately million in cash and leased the trailers back under three year walk away leases 
the resulting gain was approximately million and is being amortized over the life of the lease 
the monthly cost of the lease payments will be higher than the cost of the depreciation and interest expense  however  there will be no residual risk of loss at disposition 
in april  we also entered into an agreement with a finance company to sell approximately  dry van trailers and to lease an additional  model year dry van trailers 
we sold the trailers  which consisted of model year to model year dry van trailers  to the finance company for approximately million in cash and leased the  dry van trailers back under seven year walk away leases 
the monthly cost of the lease payments will be higher than the cost of the depreciation and interest expense  however  there will be no residual risk of loss at disposition 
the transaction was completed in the first quarter of and the leases begin to expire in june contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total there after long term debt  including current maturities securitization facility operating leases lease residual value guarantees purchase obligations diesel fuel equipment total contractual cash obligations in  this amount represents proceeds drawn under our securitization facility 
the net proceeds under the securitization facility are required to be shown as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
we expect the securitization facility to be renewed in december this amount represents volume purchase commitments through our truck stop network 
we estimate that these amounts represent approximately and of our fuel needs for and  respectively 
amount reflects the total purchase price or lease commitment of tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery throughout net of estimated trade in values and other dispositions  the estimated amount due under these commitments is approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be financed by debt  proceeds from sales of existing equipment  cash flows from operations  and operating leases 
we have the option to cancel commitments relating to tractor equipment with days notice 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases 
vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
our revenue equipment rental expense was million in  compared to million in the total amount of remaining payments under operating leases as of december   was million 
in connection with various operating leases  we issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
as of december   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we believe that the proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and was approximately million on tractors and trailers in we depreciate revenue equipment excluding day cabs over five to ten years with salvage values ranging from to 
we evaluate the salvage value  useful life  and annual depreciation of tractors and trailers annually based on the current market environment and our recent experience with disposition values 
any change could result in greater or lesser annual expense in the future 
gains or losses on disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation in our statements of operations 
we also evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment by analyzing the operating performance and future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the need to adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
impairment can be impacted by our projection of the actual level of future cash flows  the level of actual cash flows and salvage values  the methods of estimation used for determining fair values and the impact of guaranteed residuals 
any changes in management s judgments could result in greater or lesser annual depreciation expense or additional impairment charges in the future 
insurance and other claims our insurance program for liability  property damage  and cargo loss and damage  involves self insurance with high risk retention levels 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim and estimates of future claims development based on historical trends  as well as the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
because of our significant self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  our profitability would be adversely affected 
the rapid and substantial increase in our self insured retention makes these estimates an important accounting judgment 
during we engaged an independent  third party actuarial firm to assist us in evaluating our claims reserves estimates 
as a result of the actuarial study and our own procedures we recorded a million non cash  pretax increase to claims reserves during the fourth quarter of we have incorporated several procedures suggested by the actuary into our claims estimation process for future periods 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention layers  we also must make judgments concerning our aggregate coverage limits 
from to present  we carried excess coverage in amounts that have ranged from million to million in addition to our primary insurance coverage  although for the period from july through november  our aggregate coverage limit was million because of a fraudulently issued binder for our excess coverage 
if any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount  and our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims from this period were to exceed the then effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents lease accounting and off balance sheet transactions operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment  computer equipment and company airplane 
in connection with the leases of a majority of the value of the equipment we finance with operating leases  we issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
as of december   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation on all operating leases 
the estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments 
as leases are entered into determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives 
accounting for income taxes in this area  we make important judgments concerning a variety of factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on future company performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
in connection with an audit of our and tax returns  the irs proposed to disallow three of our tax strategies 
we have filed an appeal in the matter and have not yet been contacted by the irs appeals division to schedule a hearing 
in april  we submitted a million cash bond to the internal revenue service to prevent any future interest expense in the event of an unsuccessful defense of the strategies 
in addition  we have accrued amounts that we believe are appropriate given our expectations concerning the ultimate resolution of the strategies 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet and are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities tax benefits and liabilities expected to be realized in the future are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense 
on a periodic basis we assess the need for adjustment of the valuation allowance 
no valuation reserve has been established at december   because  based on forecasted income  we believe that it is more likely than not that the future benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
during  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of income tax liabilities 
however  should our tax positions be challenged  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported through our consolidated statement of operations 
inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
new emissions control regulations and increases in commodity prices  wages of manufacturing workers  and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the cost of fuel also has risen substantially over the past three years 
we believe this increase primarily reflects world events rather than underlying inflationary pressure 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates  certain cost control efforts and the effects of fuel prices through fuel surcharges 

table of contents seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
for the reasons stated  first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year 
our equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and because of general increases in shipping demand during those months 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by our dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting our equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during  and we believe that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality for our business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
equipment utilization table miles per tractor per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter factors that may affect future results the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
some of the most significant of these factors include excess tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry  declines in the resale value of used equipment  strikes or other work stoppages  increases in interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  and license and registration fees  rising costs of healthcare 
we also are affected by recessionary economic cycles  changes in customers inventory levels  and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as retail and manufacturing  where we have a significant concentration of customers  and regions of the country  such as california  texas  and the southeast  where we have a significant amount of business 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against any foreign state  heightened security requirements  or other related events 
such events  however  could negatively impact the economy and consumer confidence in the united states 
such events could also have a materially adverse effect on our future results of operations 
moreover  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher repairs and maintenance costs 
we self insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure  which could significantly increase the volatility of  and decrease the amount of  our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expense could reduce our earnings and make our earnings more volatile 
we currently self insure for a portion of our claims exposure and accrue amounts for liabilities based on our assessment of claims that arise and our insurance coverage for the periods in which the claims arise 
in general  for casualty claims after march   we are self insured for the first million of each personal injury and property damage claim and the first million of each cargo claim 
we are also responsible for a pro rata portion of legal expenses relating to such claims 
we maintain a workers compensation plan and group medical plan for our employees with a deductible amount of million for each workers compensation claim and a stop loss amount of  for each group medical claim 
because of our significant self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  our profitability would be adversely affected and could vary significantly from period to period 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million adjustment to our claims reserves  and we cannot assure you that future adjustments will not occur 

table of contents we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance carriers 
our insurance and claims expense could increase when our current coverages expire or we could raise our self insured retention 
if these expenses increase  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
our current aggregate primary and excess casualty insurance provides coverage up to a maximum per claim amount of million 
we do not maintain directors and officers insurance coverage  although we are obligated to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur while serving in such capacities 
if any claim were to exceed our coverage  we would bear the excess  in addition to our other self insured amounts 
any such claim could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
ongoing insurance requirements could constrain our borrowing capacity 
the increase in our self insured retention has caused our outstanding undrawn letters of credit in favor of insurance companies to increase 
at december   our revolving line of credit had a maximum borrowing limit of million  outstanding borrowings of million  and outstanding letters of credit of million 
we expect outstanding letters of credit to increase in the future 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the available borrowings under our credit agreement  which could negatively affect our liquidity should we need to increase our borrowings in the future 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability 
these factors include we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers  railroads  and other transportation companies  many of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do 
many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business 
many of our customers are other transportation companies  and they may decide to transport their own freight 
many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved  service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 
competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates 
economies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
in the aggregate  subsidiaries of cnf  inc accounted for approximately of our revenue in we do not expect these percentages to change materially for generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to use our services or that they will continue at the same levels 
for some of our customers  we have entered into multi year contracts and we cannot assure you that the rates will remain advantageous 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
increases in compensation or difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
our ability to attract and retain drivers could be adversely affected by increased availability of alternative employment opportunities in an economic expansion and by the potential need for more drivers due to more restrictive driver hours of service requirements imposed by the us department of transportation effective january  if we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package  let trucks sit idle  or operate with fewer independent contractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands  all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we may not be successful in improving our profitability 
we have implemented certain initiatives designed to improve our profitability 
in our net margin improved 
in our net margins excluding the million non cash  after tax increase to claims reserves  increased further 
however  we face significant cost increases in  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to improve our profitability 
if we fail to sustain or improve our profitability  our stock price could decline 

table of contents our growth may not return to historical rates  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we experienced significant growth in revenue between our founding in and since  however  our revenue base has remained relatively constant 
there can be no assurance that our revenue growth rate will return to historical levels or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
we can provide no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
slower or less profitable growth could adversely affect our stock price 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
our operations are regulated and licensed by various us  canadian  and mexican agencies 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the united states department of transportation  or dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to us and canadian regulations 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours of service  ergonomics  or other matters affecting safety or operating methods 
future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices  influence the demand for transportation services  or require us to incur significant additional costs 
higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices would adversely affect our results of operations 
beginning in  motor carriers were required to comply with several changes to dot hours of service requirements that may have a positive or negative effect on driver hours and miles and our operations 
a citizens advocacy group successfully petitioned the courts that the new rules were developed without driver health in mind 
pending further action by the courts or the effectiveness of new rules addressing these issues  congress has enacted a law that extends the effectiveness of the new rules until september  we cannot predict whether there will be changes to the hours of service rules  the extent of any changes  or whether there will be further court challenges 
given this uncertainty  we are unable to determine the future effect of driver hour regulations on our operations 
the dot is also considering implementing higher safety requirements on trucks 
these regulatory changes may have an adverse affect on our future profitability 
the irs has audited our and tax returns and proposed the disallowance of deductions related to certain of our tax planning structures  which could affect our effective tax rate 
federal  state  and local taxes comprise a significant part of our expenses 
as such  we actively manage these expenses when executing our business strategy 
consequently  when we believe it is appropriate  we use a number of structures to permanently decrease our overall tax liability or to defer tax payments 
during  we implemented two structures of a type that have been subject to heightened irs scrutiny 
in the first of these structures  we formed a trust to fund the payment of certain contested third party claims 
we deducted the contributions to the trust in the form of our right to receive payment on certain notes issued by our subsidiaries 
in the second of these structures  we changed our k plan year to end on december  and as a result deducted our plan year contribution in both of these structures were designed to accelerate deductions to an earlier date than when they otherwise would have been available 
the irs has proposed the disallowance of the deductions relating to the trust and k plan structures 
the irs also reviewed a captive insurance company that we established in  and that also was disclosed  and proposed the disallowance of deductions for premium payments made by certain insured subsidiaries 
we are prepared to vigorously defend these deductions  and accordingly have filed a formal protest with the irs 
this protest is subject to review by and a formal hearing with the irs appeals division 
irs appeals has acknowledged the timely filing of our protest  but a hearing has not yet been scheduled 
in april  we submitted a million cash bond to the irs  which stopped the running of interest expense in the event of a successful challenge by the irs of all issues under protest 
in addition  we have accrued amounts that we believe are appropriate given our expectations concerning the ultimate resolution of these matters 
a successful challenge by the irs of the trust and k plan deductions would affect only the timing  not the ultimate deductibility of  the related deductions  and there would consequently be no effect on income tax expense or the effective tax rate 
if the irs successfully challenges the captive insurance company deductions  we would incur additional income tax expense related to  and of approximately million  which would adversely impact our effective tax rate both in the year of payment and prospectively 

table of contents we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms 
the truckload industry is capital intensive  and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually 
for the past few years  we have depended on cash from operations  our credit facilities  and operating leases to fund our revenue equipment 
our budget for capital expenditures  net of any offsets from sales or trades of equipment  is to million in  exclusive of acquisitions 
if we elect to expand our fleet in future periods  our capital needs would increase 
we expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our line of credit  proceeds under the securitization facility and operating leases of revenue equipment 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into less favorable financing arrangements  or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
we currently have trade in or fixed residual agreements with certain equipment suppliers concerning the substantial majority of our tractor fleet 
if the suppliers refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements  or if we decline to purchase the relevant number of replacement units from the suppliers  we may suffer a financial loss upon the disposition of our equipment 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments  may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political  and other factors beyond our control 
for example  our average price for diesel fuel was per gallon in  as compared to per gallon in fuel also is subject to regional pricing differences and often costs more on the west coast  where we have significant operations 
from time to time we have used fuel surcharges  hedging contracts  and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations 
although we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts  these arrangements do not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
we currently do not have any fuel hedging contracts in place 
if we do hedge  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
a small portion of our fuel requirements for are covered by volume purchase commitments 
based on current market conditions  we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures  fluctuations in fuel prices  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not make acquisitions in the future  or if we do  we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy 
we made nine acquisitions between and  including four between september and august accordingly  acquisitions have provided a substantial portion of our growth 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  negotiating  or consummating any future acquisitions 
if we fail to make any future acquisitions  our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected 
any acquisitions we undertake could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or incurring indebtedness 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees  and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials  fuel storage tanks  air emissions from our vehicles and facilities  and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
we also maintain above ground bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at two of our facilities 
a small percentage of our freight consists of low grade hazardous substances  which subjects us to a wide array of regulations 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  we could be subject to liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

table of contents increased prices  reduced productivity  and restricted availability of new revenue equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
we have experienced higher prices for new tractors over the past three years  partially as a result of government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines 
more restrictive environmental protection agency  or epa  emissions standards for will require vendors to introduce new engines  and some carriers may seek to purchase large numbers of tractors with pre engines  possibly leading to shortages 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors and trailers for these or other reasons 
as a result  we expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses and related financing costs for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the new engines are expected to reduce equipment productivity and lower fuel mileage and  therefore  increase our operating expenses 
we have agreements covering the terms of trade in and or repurchase commitments from our primary equipment vendors for disposal of a substantial portion of our revenue equipment 
the prices we expect to receive under these arrangements may be higher than the prices we would receive in the open market 
we may suffer a financial loss upon disposition of our equipment if these vendors refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements  if we fail to enter into definitive agreements that reflect the terms we expect  if we fail to enter into similar arrangements in the future  or if we do not purchase the required number of replacement units from the vendors 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
for enterprises that are not small business issuers  fin r is to be applied to all variable interest entities by the end of the first reporting period ending after march  our adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments  an amendment of fasb and on accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas r is effective for most public companies with interim or annual periods beginning after june  we will adopt this statement effective july  our adoption of sfas r will impact our results of operations by increasing salaries  wages and related expenses 
the amount of the expected impact is still being reviewed by the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
commodity price risk from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in accordance with sfas  we adjust any derivative instruments to fair value through earnings on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
historically  we have used a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
our variable rate obligations consist of our credit agreement and our securitization facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  are based on the banks base rate  which floats daily  or libor  which accrues interest based on one  two  three  or six month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on a consolidated leverage ratio  which is generally defined as the ratio of borrowings  letters of credit  and the present value of operating lease obligations to our earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  and rental payments under operating leases 
the applicable margin was at december  at december   we had variable  base rate borrowings of million outstanding under the credit agreement 

table of contents during the first quarter of  we entered into two million notional amount interest rate swap agreements to manage the risk of variability in cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
the swaps expire january and march due to the counter parties embedded options to cancel  these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and consequently are marked to fair value through earnings  in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
at december   the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million 
our securitization facility carries a variable interest rate based on the commercial paper rate plus an applicable margin of per annum 
at december   borrowings of million had been drawn on the securitization facility 
assuming variable rate borrowings under the credit agreement and securitization facility at december  levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates could increase our annual interest expense by approximately
