general ultralife batteries  inc is a global provider of power solutions for diverse applications 
the company develops  manufactures and markets a wide range of non rechargeable and rechargeable batteries  charging systems and accessories for use in military  industrial and consumer portable electronic products 
through its range of standard products and engineered solutions  ultralife is able to provide the next generation of power systems 
the company believes that its technologies allow the company to offer batteries that are flexibly configured  lightweight and generally achieve longer operating time than many competing batteries currently available 
effective december   the company changed its fiscal year end from june to december the financial results presented in this report reflecting the calendar year ended december  are referred to as 
the financial results presented in this report reflecting the six month period ended december  are referred to as transition 
the financial results presented in this report reflecting the full twelve month fiscal periods that ended june prior to transition are referred to as fiscal years 
for instance  the year ended june  is referred to as fiscal  and the year ended june  is referred to as fiscal 
the financial results pertaining to the twelve month period ended december  and the six month period ended december  were derived from unaudited financial statements  due to the company s change in its fiscal year end 
the company reports its results in three operating segments non rechargeable batteries  rechargeable batteries  and technology contracts 
the non rechargeable batteries segment includes volt  cylindrical and various other non rechargeable specialty batteries 
the rechargeable batteries segment includes the company s lithium polymer and lithium ion rechargeable batteries and battery chargers and accessories 
the technology contracts segment includes revenues and related costs associated with various government and military development contracts 
the company looks at its segment performance at the gross margin level  and does not allocate research and development or selling  general and administrative costs against the segments 
all other items that do not specifically relate to these three segments and are not considered in the performance of these segments are considered to be corporate charges 
currently  the company does not experience significant seasonal trends in non rechargeable battery revenues and does not have enough sales history on the rechargeable batteries to determine if there is seasonality 
subsequent to the company s fourth quarter earnings release dated february   a review of the company s tax accounts indicated that the computation of its deferred tax asset required an adjustment due to certain deductions for gains from exercises of stock options that were not granted under a shareholder approved plan 
as a result  the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  has been adjusted accordingly  resulting in a decrease of approximately million in the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding decrease in additional paid in capital 
the consolidated statement of operations was not impacted by this adjustment

although the company has reserved for expenses related to this potential exposure  there can be no assurance that such reserve will be the maximum amount 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
the company typically offers warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a year warranty on its volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
the company provides for a reserve for this potential warranty expense  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event the company s experiences a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that the company s reserves are sufficient

outlook in december  the company was awarded a five year battery production contract by the us defense department  up to a maximum value of  related to the us military s next gen ii phase iv solicitation for non rechargeable lithium manganese dioxide batteries 
the company expects to recognize some revenue under this contract as early as the second quarter of  with substantial revenues anticipated in the second half of the year 
in addition  in february  the company was awarded a five year production contract by the us defense department  to provide its ba non rechargeable lithium manganese dioxide batteries to the us military  valued at up to  the company expects to complete the qualification process before the end of after which it will begin production shipments 
both of these contract awards by the us defense department have been protested by certain competitors of the company during the first quarter of  preventing the government from participating in any work that is performed while the protests are being adjudicated 
the government is required to respond within days after a protest has been filed and no further action is required on the company s part 
looking ahead for the full calendar year of  the company is optimistic about its growth prospects and the status of manufacturing operations 
at this time  the company expects revenues to increase in the range of to over this growth is expected to result from continued success in growing commercial business  in key target markets such as medical and automotive telematics 
this revenue growth target also assumes sizeable order activity from the us military  in conjunction with the award of the next gen ii phase iv contract as well as a favorable resolution of the recent protest of that contract in a timely fashion and other anticipated contract activity 
order activity and shipments are expected to increase throughout the year  as commercial orders take hold and the military business stabilizes 
operating income in is expected to show steady growth throughout the year  returning to profitability in the second quarter and moving toward the company s near term operating margin target of by year end 
management s operating income guidance excludes any potential impact from expensing stock options  which if the current accounting standards remain unchanged  the company would be required to recognize beginning no later than the third quarter of management expects that its overall effective income tax rate will be in the range of of pre tax earnings during  although actual cash payments for income taxes are expected to be nominal as the company utilizes its net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
for the first quarter ending april   management currently projects revenues of approximately  and an operating loss of approximately  on march   the company received and announced a  order for ba batteries with the us military 
the first quarter revenue projection anticipates that a substantial portion of this contract will be delivered within the quarter 
due to the timing of the receipt of this contract  it is possible that some revenue may shift into the second quarter 
the results in each of the quarters can be subject to fluctuations as the timing of some customer orders is not often easily predictable 
in particular  volt revenues are dependent upon continued demand from the company s customers  some of which are dependent upon retail sell through 
similarly  revenues from sales of cylindrical products  primarily to military customers  are dependent upon a variety of factors  including the timing of the battery solicitation process within the military  the company s ability to successfully win contract awards  successful qualification of the company s products in the applicable military applications  the timing of shipments related to lot 
table of contents acceptance  and the timing of order releases against such contracts 
additionally  there is always a risk that congressional appropriations might vary from what is needed or expected 
some of these factors are outside of the company s direct control 
over the next three to four years  with anticipated growth in various target markets  such as military  medical  automotive telematics  and search and rescue  the company has targeted an annual growth rate in revenues of approximately  heading toward  while the company s revenues were comprised of approximately from us military sales in  this percentage is expected to decline over time as the company generates increased sales from customers in commercial and industrial markets 
as sales continue to grow  manufacturing efficiencies are realized  and investments in operating expenses r d and sg a are closely monitored  the company believes it can generate favorable returns to scale in the range of to on incremental revenues  depending on product mix 
conversely  decreasing volumes will likely result in the opposite effect 
within the next several quarters  the company believes that its gross margins can reach a range of as it nears approximately  million in quarterly revenues  resulting from ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and an increase in the mix of products with higher margins 
management has set an overall target of gross margins for the longer term  as revenues reach a range of approximately  per quarter 
r d costs in are expected to be modestly higher than the company has invested additional resources to continue its recent focus on developing power solutions for new applications  most of which are various commercial and industrial market opportunities 
while the r d expense line is expected to grow modestly  the company will also continue to enhance these efforts with technology contracts  the revenues and related costs for which are reported as a part of the technology contracts segment 
while the company continues to monitor its operating costs very closely  sg a costs are expected to increase in order to support the needs of a growing business 
within the next several quarters  the company believes that its operating expenses will be in the range of of revenues at the point where revenues are in the range of  per quarter  and it has set a target to reach of revenues in the longer term when total sales amount to a range of  per quarter 
as gross margins improve and as the company continues to control its operating expenses  operating income as a percentage of revenues is projected to be in the range of at a revenue level of approximately  per quarter  with a longer term target of at a revenue level of approximately  per quarter 
at december   the company had approximately  in net operating loss nol carryforwards available to offset current and future taxable income 
at the end of  the company determined there was sufficient positive evidence in accordance with fas to record a deferred tax asset at december  related to the company s us nols  which amounted to  of the total 
as a result  the company recorded a  net deferred tax asset primarily related to the anticipated future benefit from the nols  based in part on recent military contracts 
related to the recognition of a deferred tax asset  the company recognized a  deferred income tax credit in its consolidated statement of operations in  in addition to an increase in additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet related to the tax benefit from previous stock option exercises 
in  the company expects to reflect a consolidated effective income tax rate in the range of in the consolidated statement of operations 
however  the vast majority of the expense is expected to have a non cash impact on the company as it utilizes the benefits from the nol carryforwards to offset taxable income 
in addition  in early  the company determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  had occurred during the fourth quarter of  resulting in an annual limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
the company currently estimates that the amount of such limitation will be in the range of approximately  annually 
if the company s us taxable income were to exceed this annual limitation  it could result in a higher than anticipated current tax expense for any year in which this occurs 
during  the company projects that it will spend approximately  to  on capital expenditures for machinery and equipment 
a portion of these expenditures will be to increase capacity at the company s uk manufacturing facility for growth related to that facility s award of a portion of the next gen ii phase iv contract with the us military 
other planned expenditures include energy savings projects and vertical integration programs to reduce material costs 
pursuant to its  credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants 
in particular  the company monitors a debt to earnings ratio based on trailing month earnings 
the result of this ratio 
table of contents impacts the overall cost of borrowing to the company and also may limit the overall amount of debt that the company may obtain under this facility 
if the company s debt to earnings ratio changes adversely  such changes may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on the company s outlook for the first quarter of and the associated trailing month earnings  the company s borrowing capacity may be significantly limited due to a total debt outstanding allowed under the agreement of two times earnings  as defined in the agreement 
the company is working with the banks to alleviate this situation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition battery sales in general  revenues from the sale of batteries are recognized when products are shipped 
when products are shipped with terms that require transfer of title upon delivery at a customer s location  revenues are recognized on date of delivery 
a provision is made at the time the revenue is recognized for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers do not have a general right of return on products shipped 
technology contracts the company recognizes revenue using the proportional effort method based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
the company allocates costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
under certain research and development arrangements with the us government  the company may be required to transfer technology developed to the us government 
the company has accounted for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
the company  where appropriate  has recognized a liability for amounts that may be repaid to third parties  or for revenue deferred until expenditures have been incurred 
in may  the company adopted the provisions of eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
adoption of this issue had no significant impact on the company s revenue recognition policy or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the bulletin s primary purpose was to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this should not be considered a change in accounting principle 
the issuance did not have a material impact on the company 
warranties the company maintains provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
the company evaluates these reserves monthly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date 
impairment of long lived assets the company regularly assesses all of its long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used by the company in its evaluation approximates the company s weighted average cost of capital 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 

table of contents environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
investments in affiliates the company regularly reviews the carrying value of its investments in affiliates to ensure that these amounts are appropriate 
if the carrying value of an investment is impaired and is deemed to be other than temporary  the company will adjust the value of such an investment accordingly 
investments in which the company holds a greater than interest are recorded by the company on a consolidated basis of accounting  investments in which the company holds between and are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and investments in which the company holds less than a interest are recorded using the cost method 
stock based compensation the company applies accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations which require compensation costs to be recognized based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of the stock on the grant date and the exercise price 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as all options granted to employees under such plans had an exercise price at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and given the fixed nature of the equity instruments  no stock option based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income 
income tax liabilities the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how an entity should evaluate impairment for certain investments  specifically  how to define other than temporary impairment and how such impairment should be accounted for by the cost method under apb subsequently  in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a final fasb staff position  fsp eitf issue that delays the effective date for measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs of eitf although implementation of the issue has been delayed  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on october   president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of hr 
the act contains numerous corporate tax provisions that could affect the company s current and future tax provisions 
the company is currently assessing any potential impact of these provisions 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no

risk factors dependence on continued demand for the company s existing products a substantial portion of the company s business depends on the continued demand for products using our batteries sold by original equipment manufacturers oem 
therefore  the company s success depends significantly upon the success of those oems products in the marketplace 
the company is subject to many risks beyond its control that influence the success or failure of a particular product manufactured by an oem  including competition faced by the oem in its particular industry  market acceptance of the oem s product  the engineering  sales  marketing and management capabilities of the oem  technical challenges unrelated to our technology or products faced by the oem in developing its products  and the financial and other resources of the oem for instance  in the year ended december   of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of its volt batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales to smoke alarm oems in the us in  of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of its volt batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to smoke alarm oems in the us if the retail demand for long life smoke detectors decreases significantly  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  in the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of us cylindrical batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales made directly or indirectly to the us military 
in  of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of us cylindrical batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales made directly or indirectly to the us military 
if the demand for cylindrical batteries from the us military were to decrease significantly  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to adjustment of certain government contracts the company has had certain exigent  non bid contracts with the government which have been subject to an audit and final price adjustment which have resulted in decreased margins compared with the original terms of the contracts 
as of december   there were no outstanding exigent contracts with the government 
as part of its due diligence  the government will be conducting post audits of the completed exigent contracts to ensure that information used in supporting the pricing of exigent contracts did not differ materially from actual results 
if any material differences are found  which the company believes is unlikely  such adjustments could reduce margins and have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks related to development of rechargeable battery business although the company is developing and is in production of certain rechargeable cells and batteries  it cannot assure that volume acceptance of its rechargeable products will occur due to the highly competitive nature of the business 
there are many new company and technology entrants into the marketplace  and the company must continually reassess the market segments in which its products can be successful and seek to engage customers in these segments that will adopt the company s products for use in their products 
in addition  these companies must be successful with their products in their markets for the company to gain increased business 
increased competition  failure to gain customer acceptance of products or failure of the company s customers in their markets could have a further adverse effect on the company s rechargeable battery business 
risks relating to growth and expansion continued rapid growth of the company s battery business could significantly strain management  operations and technical resources 
if the company is successful in obtaining rapid market growth of its batteries  the company will be required to deliver large volumes of quality products to customers on a timely basis at a reasonable cost to those customers 
for example  the large contracts recently received from the us military for the company s cylindrical products could strain the current capacity capabilities of the company s uk facility and require additional equipment and time to build a sufficient support infrastructure at that location 
this demand could also create working capital issues for the company  as it may need increased liquidity to fund purchases of raw materials and supplies 
the company cannot assure  however  that business will rapidly grow or that its efforts to expand manufacturing and quality control activities will be successful or that the company will be able to satisfy commercial scale production requirements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company will also be required to continue to improve its operations  management and financial systems and controls 
the failure to manage growth effectively could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on us military procurement of batteries the company will continue to develop both non rechargeable and rechargeable battery products to meet the needs of the us military forces 
the company believes it has a high probability for success in solicitations for these batteries  as well as meeting delivery schedules for orders released under contract 
any delay of solicitations or anticipated purchase orders by  or future failure of  the us government to purchase batteries manufactured by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company is typically required to successfully meet contractual specifications and to pass various qualification testing for the batteries under contract by the military 
an inability by the company to pass these tests in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
when a government contract is awarded  there is a government procedure that allows for companies to formally protest such award if they believe they were unjustly treated in the evaluation process 
in early  competitor s of the company protested the company s award of the  next gen ii phase iv contract with the us military and the  contract to provide ba u batteries used to power thermal weapon sights for the us military 
as a result the government is precluded from progressing under these contracts until the protests are resolved 
a prolonged delay in the resolution of a protest  or a reversal of an award resulting from such a protest could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to competition and technological obsolescence the company competes with large and small manufacturers of alkaline  carbon zinc  seawater  and high rate batteries as well as other manufacturers of lithium batteries  both rechargeable and non rechargeable 
the company cannot assure that it will successfully compete with these manufacturers  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  distribution  marketing  sales and other resources 
the market for the company s products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards  often resulting in product obsolescence or short product lifecycles 
although the company believes that its batteries are comprised of state of the art technology  there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop technologies or products that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or less marketable 
non rechargeable batteries the non rechargeable battery industry is characterized by intense competition with a number of companies offering or seeking to develop products similar to the company s 
the company is subject to competition from manufacturers of non rechargeable batteries  such as carbon zinc  alkaline and lithium batteries in various configurations  including volt  aaa  aa  c  d  a and other cell sizes 
manufacturers of non rechargeable batteries

panasonic 
manufacturers of specialty lithium batteries include saft and eagle picher industries 
many of these companies have substantially greater resources than the company  and some have the capacity and volume of business to be able to produce their products more efficiently than the company at the present time 
in addition  these companies are developing batteries using a variety of battery technologies and chemistries that are expected to compete with the company s technology 
if these companies successfully market their batteries before the introduction of the company s products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rechargeable batteries the rechargeable battery industry is also characterized by intense competition with a large number of companies offering or seeking to develop technology and products similar to the company s 
the company is subject to competition from manufacturers of traditional rechargeable batteries  such as nickel cadmium batteries  from manufacturers of rechargeable batteries of more recent technologies  such as nickel metal hydride  lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries  as well as from companies engaged in the development of batteries incorporating new technologies

ltd  lg chemical  ltd  skc  samsung sdi co  ltd  and kokam engineering co  ltd  which was acquired by eagle picher industries in many companies with substantially greater resources are developing a variety of battery technologies  including lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries  which are expected to compete with the company s technology 
if these companies successfully market their batteries before the introduction of the company s products  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel because of the specialized  technical nature of the business  the company is highly dependent on certain members of management  marketing  engineering and technical staff 
the loss of these services or these members could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to developing manufacturing capacity to produce high volumes of batteries  the company must attract  recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees 
the company s ability to pursue effectively its business strategy will depend upon  among other factors  the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced managerial  marketing  engineering and technical personnel 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to retain or recruit this type of personnel 
an inability to hire sufficient numbers of people or to find people with the desired skills could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
safety risks  demands of environmental and other regulatory compliance due to the high energy density inherent in lithium batteries  the company s batteries can pose certain safety risks  including the risk of fire 
although the company incorporates safety procedures in research  development  manufacturing processes and the transportation of batteries that are designed to minimize safety risks  the company cannot assure that accidents will not occur 
although the company currently carries insurance policies which cover loss of the plant and machinery  leasehold improvements  inventory and business interruption  any accident  whether at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of the products  may result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
these types of losses could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
national  state and local laws impose various environmental controls on the manufacture  storage  use and disposal of lithium batteries and or of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of lithium batteries 
although the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations and that  except as noted below  there are no environmental conditions that will require material expenditures for clean up at the present or former facilities or at facilities to which it has sent waste for disposal  there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on the company or otherwise subject it to future liabilities 
moreover  state and local governments may enact additional restrictions relating to the disposal of lithium batteries used by customers that could have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  
table of contents the us department of transportation and certain foreign regulatory agencies that consider lithium to be a hazardous material regulate the transportation of batteries that contain lithium metal 
the company currently ships lithium batteries in accordance with regulations established by the us department of transportation 
there can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture  transportation  storage  use and disposal of materials used to manufacture the company s batteries or restricting disposal of batteries will not be imposed or how these regulations will affect the company or its customers 
in connection with the company s purchase lease of its newark  new york facility in  the company entered into a payment in lieu of tax agreement which provides the company with real estate tax concessions upon meeting certain conditions 
see item  legal proceedings  for additional information 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
furthermore  the company may face claims resulting in substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and the results of operations in the period in which such claims are resolved 
limited sources of supply and increases in material costs certain materials used in products are available only from a single or a limited number of suppliers 
as such  some materials could become in short supply resulting in limited availability and or increased costs 
additionally  the company may elect to develop relationships with a single or limited number of suppliers for materials that are otherwise generally available 
due to the company s involvement with supplying military batteries to the government  the company could receive a government preference to continue to obtain critical supplies to meet military production needs 
however  if the government did not provide the company with a government preference in such circumstances  the difficulty in obtaining supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
although the company believes that alternative suppliers are available to supply materials that could replace materials currently used and that  if necessary  the company would be able to redesign its products to make use of such alternatives  any interruption in the supply from any supplier that serves as a sole source could delay product shipments and have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company has experienced interruptions of product deliveries by sole source suppliers  these interruptions have not had a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company cannot guarantee that it will not experience a material interruption of product deliveries from sole source suppliers 
additionally  the company could face increasing pricing pressure from its suppliers dependent upon volume  due to rising costs by these suppliers that could be passed on to the company in higher prices for its raw materials  which could have a material effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on proprietary technologies the company s success depends more on the knowledge  ability  experience and technological expertise of its employees than on the legal protection of patents and other proprietary rights 
the company claims proprietary rights in various unpatented technologies  know how  trade secrets and trademarks relating to products and manufacturing processes 
the company cannot guarantee the degree of protection these various claims may or will afford  or that competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the company protects its proprietary rights in its products and operations through contractual obligations  including nondisclosure agreements with certain employees  customers  consultants and strategic partners 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection these contractual measures may or will afford 
the company  however  has had patents issued and patent applications pending in the us and elsewhere 
the company cannot assure i that patents will be issued from any pending applications  or that the claims allowed under any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology  ii that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or iii as to the degree or adequacy of protection any patents or patent applications may or will afford 
if the company is found to be infringing third party patents  there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain licenses with respect to such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses could delay product shipment or the introduction of new products  and costly attempts to design around such patents could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of products 
risks related to china joint venture program in july  the company entered into several agreements related to the establishment of a manufacturing facility in changzhou  china  for the production and distribution in and from china of a lithium non rechargeable batteries 
changzhou ultra power battery co  ltd  a company organized in china china battery  purchased certain technology  equipment  training and consulting services relating to the design and operation of a lithium battery manufacturing plant 
china battery was required to pay approximately million to the company over the first two years of the agreement  of which approximately million has been paid 
the company attempted to collect the balance due under this contract 

table of contents however  china battery has indicated that it will not make these payments until certain contractual issues have been resolved 
due to china battery s questionable willingness to pay  the company wrote off in fiscal the entire balance owed as well as its investment aggregating  since china battery has not purchased technology  equipment  training or consulting services to produce batteries other than a lithium batteries  the company does not believe that china battery has the capacity to become a competitor 
the company does not anticipate that the manufacturing or marketing of a lithium batteries will be a substantial portion of its product line in the future 
however  in december  china battery sent a letter demanding reimbursement of an unspecified amount of losses they have incurred plus a refund for certain equipment that was sold to china battery 
the company has attempted to initiate negotiations to resolve the dispute 
however  an agreement has not yet been reached 
although china battery has not taken any additional steps  there can be no assurance that china battery will not further pursue such a claim which  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that such a claim is without merit 
ability to insure against losses because certain of the company s non rechargeable batteries are used in a variety of security and safety products and medical devices  it may be exposed to liability claims if such a battery fails to function properly 
the company maintains what it believes to be sufficient liability insurance coverage to protect against potential claims  however  there can be no assurance that the liability insurance will continue to be available  or that any such liability insurance would be sufficient to cover any claim or claims 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and possible volatility of stock price the company s future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as the timing and shipment of significant orders  new product introductions  delays in customer releases of purchase orders  the mix of distribution channels through which the company sells its products and general economic conditions 
frequently  a substantial portion of the company s revenues in each quarter is generated from orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
as a result  revenue levels are difficult to predict for each quarter 
if revenue results are below expectations  operating results will be adversely affected as the company has a sizeable base of fixed overhead costs that do not vary much with the changes in revenue 
in addition to the uncertainties of quarterly operating results  future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  including technological innovations or commercial products  litigation or public concerns as to the safety or commercial value of one or more of its products  may cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
risks related to product warranty claims the company typically offers warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a year warranty on its volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
the company provides for a reserve for this potential warranty expense  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event the company experiences a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that the company s reserves are sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to company s ability to finance ongoing operations and projected growth while the company believes that its revenue growth projections and its ongoing cost controls will allow it to generate cash and achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  there is no assurance as to when or if the company will be able to achieve its projections 
the company s future cash flows from operations  combined with its accessibility to cash and credit  may not be sufficient to allow the company to finance ongoing operations or to make required investments for future growth 
the company may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in this regard 
risks related to company s relationship with ultralife taiwan  inc in june  the company recorded a  non cash  non operating charge related to the company s ownership interest in ultralife taiwan  inc uti that consisted of a write off of its  note receivable from uti  including accrued interest  and the book value of its  equity investment in uti 
the company decided to record 
table of contents this charge due to events that had caused increasing uncertainty over uti s near term financial viability  including a failure by uti to meet commitments made to the company and its other creditors to secure additional financial support before july  based on these factors  and uti s operating losses over several years  the company s investment has had an other than temporary decline in fair value and the company believes that the probability of being reimbursed for the note receivable is remote 
the company continues to hold a equity interest in uti  and it is working with uti to help it through its financial difficulties in an effort to ensure a satisfactory outcome for all parties involved 
uti continues to manufacture product for the company and the company has taken steps to establish alternate sources of supply 
if uti becomes insolvent and is therefore unable to deliver product to the company and or its customers  and if alternative supply is not immediately available  such an event might cause a disruption in meeting customer demand which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has provided prepayments to uti to assist that company with the purchase of raw materials and the payment of payroll costs applicable to manufacturing the products made for the company 
at december   the net amount of prepayments made to uti was  if uti continues to have financial difficulty  it is possible that the company may not receive shipments of product for which prepayments have been made  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to maintaining debt obligations the company has certain debt covenants that must be maintained
