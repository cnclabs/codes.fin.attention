item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures and markets high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials for the electronics  military  aerospace  wireless communication  specialty and industrial markets 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china currently under construction  france two facilities  connecticut  new york  arizona and california 
the company operates under the fibercote  nelco and neltec names 
the global electronics manufacturing industry  which had become extremely and unsustainably overheated in the s and into calendar year  collapsed in calendar year  and has not recovered since that collapse 
the company believes that that industry has become a mature industry  and the company does not expect significant non cyclical  sustainable growth from that industry in the future 
although the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products improved somewhat in the second half of the fiscal year and the first half of the fiscal year  those markets weakened in the second half of the fiscal year 
however  the company s sales increased during the fiscal year  with increased sales of printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials in all regions 
while the company s sales from continuing operations increased modestly in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  the company s net earnings increased significantly in the fiscal year compared to the company s net profit from continuing operations and net earnings in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from continuing operations were less in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year preimarily because of the million pre tax gain in the fiscal year related to the payment by delco electronics corporation  a subsidiary of general motors corp 
delco  of the judgment against delco in favor of the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc nti 
despite anemic conditions in almost all markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials  the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was significantly greater than its gross profit in the fiscal year as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
the increases in sales and profits during the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year were the result of increases in sales by nearly all the company s operations  although the improvements were attributable principally to increases in sales of the company s high technology printed circuit materials  cost reductions resulting from the realignments of the company s volume printed circuit materials operations in the and fiscal years and increases in sales by the company s fibercote advanced composite materials business 
the printed circuit materials industry began to improve slightly at the end of the fiscal year second quarter and continued to improve in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters and in the fiscal year first quarter 
however  the printed circuit materials industry slowed down to some extent in the fiscal year second quarter 
consequently  sales of the company s printed circuit materials operations declined in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year compared to the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
although the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials improved to some degree during september  those markets were anemic during the remainder of the fiscal year 
consequently  sales of the company s printed circuit materials continuing operations declined in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters compared to the fiscal year first and second quarters and compared to the fiscal year third and fourth quarters 
however  the military  aerospace  wireless communication and industrial markets for the company s fibercote advanced composite materials business were healthy during the fiscal year third quarter  with particular strength coming from the rocket motor  airframe and radome components of those markets  and  as a result  sales of the company s advanced composite materials increased in each quarter of the fiscal year compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year 
while the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials continue to be very difficult to forecast  the company believes that the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials in the fiscal year first quarter is similar to the condition of such markets during the fiscal year third and fourth quarters 
on the other hand  the military  aerospace and specialty applications markets for the company s advanced composite materials business continues to be healthy during the fiscal year first quarter  with particular strength coming from the rocket motor  unmanned aerial vehicle and commercial aircraft components of those markets 
the company believes that the markets for its advanced composite materials will continue to be healthy during the fiscal year first quarter 
the company continues to invest its human and financial resources in the higher technology portions of its printed circuit materials business and in its advanced composite materials business 
during the fiscal year  the company installed one of its latest generation  high technology treaters in its newly expanded facility in singapore  and the company is completing the installation of an additional large treater at its fibercote advanced composite materials facility in waterbury  connecticut  which will effectively double fibercote s treating capacity 
while the company continued to expand and invest in its business in asia during the fiscal year  it made additional adjustments to its volume printed circuit materials businesses  particularly in north america  which resulted in workforce reductions at the company s north american and european volume printed circuit materials operations as a result of which the company recorded pre tax charges of million in the company s fiscal year third quarter 
in addition  in may  the company announced that it was reducing the size of the workforce at its neltec europe sas subsidiary in mirebeau  france  as a result of further deterioration of the european market for high technology printed circuit materials and that it expects to record a one time termination benefits charge of approximately million during the fiscal year first quarter ending may  in the fiscal year third quarter  the company also settled an insurance claim for property and business interruption losses sustained by the company in singapore as a result of an explosion in one of the four treaters located at its nelco manufacturing facility in singapore and recorded a pre tax gain of million as a result of the settlement 
during the fiscal year  the company opened a facility at its advanced products business unit in arizona that had been completed in its fiscal year and that is now being well utilized  and completed the construction of its facility expansion in singapore 
during the first half of the fiscal year  the company realigned its north american volume printed circuit materials operations located in new york and california 
as part of the realignment  the new york operation was scaled down to a smaller  focused operation and the california operation was scaled up to a larger volume operation  and there were workforce reductions at the company s new york facility and workforce increases at the company s california facility  with the end result being a net reduction in the company s workforce in north america 
a portion of the new york facility was mothballed 
the realignment was designed to help the company achieve improved operating and cost efficiencies in its north american volume printed circuit materials operations and to help the company best service all of its north american customers 
as a result of the company s realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations and related workforce reductions  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million and million in the company s fiscal year first quarter and second quarter  respectively 
the company also recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from the sale of real estate previously used by its nelco uk subsidiary  which had ceased operations after its closure in the fiscal year third quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the realignment and closure 
in february  the company discontinued its financial support of dielektra gmbh  the company s wholly owned subsidiary located in cologne  germany dielektra  which supplied electronic materials to european circuit board manufacturers 
the company discontinued its support of dielektra because the market in europe had eroded to the point where the company believed it would not be possible  at any time in the foreseeable future  for the dielektra business to be viable 
dielektra had required substantial financial support from the company 
the discontinuation of the company s financial support resulted in the filing of an insolvency petition by dielektra 
the company believes that the insolvency procedure in germany will result in the eventual reorganization  sale or liquidation of dielektra 
the company continues to service the higher technology european digital and rf circuit board markets through its neltec europe sas business located in mirebeau  france  and its neltec sa business located in lannemezan  france 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company treated dielektra as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the company reclassified dielektra s operating losses and charges and recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra  million related to the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation and related workforce reductions in the fiscal year first quarter and million for the write off of assets of dielektra and other costs  and the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million for after tax fixed asset impairment charges 
the company s sales for the fiscal year did not include any sales by dielektra  and dielektra had no impact on the company s results of operations during the fiscal year 
furthermore  the company s sales from its continuing operations did not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million related to the write downs of fixed assets at its continuing operations in north america resulting from the realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations in new york and california  workforce reductions at a north american business unit  and the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility 
these charges were only slightly offset by the pre tax gain of million realized by the company during the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of its dielectric polymers  inc dpi subsidiary for million cash 
see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the asset write downs  workforce reductions and closure and the sale of dpi 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in its fiscal year third quarter for the cost of closing its nelco uk manufacturing facility located in skelmersdale  england in response to the almost complete collapse of the uk high technology circuit board industry 
for many years  nelco uk was one of the most vital parts of the company s global high technology circuit materials business  but the uk high technology circuit board industry had been devastated  and the closure of the nelco uk facility was unavoidable  as there was not enough business available in the entire uk market to justify the company s having an operation in the uk the company is supplying its few remaining customers in the uk with product produced at its neltec facility located in mirebeau  france and will continue to provide these uk customers with local account management  technical service and materials and inventory support 
in addition  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million during the fiscal year third quarter for severance payments for workforce reductions at a north american business unit 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the closure and severance payments 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  the company reassessed the recoverability of the fixed assets of those operations based on cash flow projections and determined that such fixed assets were impaired  and the company recorded pre tax impairment charges of million in the company s fiscal year fourth quarter to reduce the book values of such fixed assets to their estimated fair values 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the asset impairment charges 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total worldwide sales were to delco  and the company s wholly owned subsidiary  nti located in tempe  arizona  had been delco s principal supplier of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials  commonly known as mass lamination  which were used by delco to produce finished multilayer printed circuit boards 
however  in march  the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
as a result  the company s sales to delco declined during the three month period ended may   were negligible during the remainder of the fiscal year and have been nil since that time 
in may  the company and nti filed a complaint against delco and the delphi automotive systems unit of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nti and that delphi interfered with nti s contract with delco  that delco breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract  that delco engaged in negligent misrepresentation and that delco fraudulently induced nti to enter into the contract 
in november  a jury awarded damages to nti in the amount of million  and in december the judge in the united states district court for the district of arizona entered judgment for nti on its claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with damages in the amount of million 
both parties appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco  and in may  a panel of three judges in the court of appeals for the ninth circuit rendered a unanimous decision affirming the jury verdict 
in june  the united states district court for the district of arizona entered final judgment in favor of nti  and  on july   nti received a net amount of million in payment of such judgment 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter related to such payment 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the gain on the lawsuit against delco and item of part i of this report for additional information regarding the lawsuit against delco 
the company is not engaged in any related party transactions involving relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with the company or the company s related parties  or in any transactions with parties with whom the company or its related parties have a relationship that enables the parties to negotiate terms of material transactions that may or would not be available from other  more clearly independent parties on an arm s length basis  or in any trading activities involving non exchange traded commodity or other contracts that are accounted for at fair value or otherwise or in any energy trading or risk management activities  other than certain limited foreign currency contracts intended to hedge the company s contractual commitments to pay certain obligations or to realize certain receipts in foreign currencies and certain limited energy purchase contracts intended to protect the company from increased utilities costs 
the company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures  which include special items  such as realignment and severance charges and the gains on the insurance claim settlement  the delco lawsuit and the sale of real estate 
accordingly  in addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with gaap  the company discloses non gaap operating results that exclude certain items in order to assist its shareholders and other readers in assessing the company s operating performance  since the company s on going  normal business operations do not include such special items 
such non gaap financial measures are provided to supplement the results provided in accordance with gaap 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s sales of both its printed circuit materials and its advanced composite materials increased in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february   after a slight decline in the company s sales of printed circuit materials in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the increase in sales of printed circuit materials was accomplished despite the continued anemic conditions in the north american and european markets and  to a lesser extent  in the asian markets for printed circuit materials 
the increased sales in the fiscal year and a further improvement in the company s gross profit margin in the fiscal year  following a substantial improvement in the fiscal year compared to the and fiscal years  enabled the company s continuing operations to generate a larger gross profit than in the prior fiscal year 
the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was substantially higher than the gross profit in the prior fiscal year as a result of increased sales  the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales by the company of its higher margin  high technology printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials 
these improvements in gross profits occurred despite slightly lower levels of total sales in the fiscal year fourth quarter than in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and lower levels of sales of printed circuit materials in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters than in the comparable periods of the fiscal year and than in the fiscal year first and second quarters 
in addition  the operating inefficiencies resulting from operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities and the competitive pressures that existed in the fiscal year persisted in the fiscal year 
the company s financial results of operations were enhanced by the pre tax gain of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from its settlement of an insurance claim for property and business interruption losses sustained by the company in singapore as a result of an explosion in november in one of the four treaters located at its nelco manufacturing facility in singapore  which was only partially offset by the pre tax charges of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year third quarter related to workforce reductions at the company s north american and european volume printed circuit materials operations 
operating results of the company s advanced composite materials business improved during the fiscal year primarily as a result of higher sales volumes related to strength in the rocket motor and airframe components of the military  aerospace  wireless communication and industrial markets for advanced composite materials 
sales of the fibercote advanced composite materials business unit increased to of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year compared with of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year 
results of operations net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended february  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  the increase in net sales from continuing operations was the result of increased sales by the company s operations in all regions and increased sales of the company s high technology printed circuit materials and an increase in sales of the company s advanced composite materials 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total net sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total net sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year and and  respectively  of total net sales worldwide from continuing operating during the and fiscal years 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year as sales by the company s operations in both singapore and france increased 
for the fiscal year ended february   the company s sales in north america  asia and europe were  and  respectively  of the company s total net sales worldwide compared with the same percentages for the fiscal year ended february  the company s sales in north america increased  its sales in asia increased and its sales in europe increased in the fiscal year over the fiscal year 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide continuing operations improved to during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin was attributable to reduced operating costs resulting from the realignments of the company s north american volume printed circuit materials operations in the and fiscal years and higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high temperature printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials 
high temperature printed circuit materials accounted for of the company s total net printed circuit materials sales worldwide from continuing operations for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin during the fiscal year also was attributable to increased sales of the company s printed circuit materials and the company s advanced composite materials from the fiscal year  which were only partially offset by slightly lower levels of total sales in the fiscal year fourth quarter than in the fiscal year fourth quarter and lower levels of sales of electronic materials in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters than in the fiscal year comparable quarters and than in the fiscal year first and second quarters 
in addition  the operating inefficiencies resulting from operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities and the competitive pressures that existed in the fiscal year persisted in the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company s total net sales worldwide of high temperature printed circuit materials  which included high performance non fr materials  were of the company s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials  compared with for last fiscal year  while the company s net sales of such high temperature printed circuit materials in north america were of the company s total net sales of printed circuit materials in north america  compared with for last fiscal year  and the company s net sales of such materials in asia and europe combined were of the company s total net sales of printed circuit materials in asia and europe combined  compared with for last fiscal year 
the company s high temperature printed circuit materials include its high performance non fr materials  which consist of high speed low loss materials for digital applications requiring increased  high bandwidth signal integrity  bismalimide triazine bt materials  polyimides for applications that demand extremely high thermal performance  cyanate esters  and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials for rf microwave systems that operate at frequencies up to ghz 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company s total net sales worldwide of high performance non fr printed circuit materials were of the company s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials  compared with for last fiscal year  while the company s net sales of such high performance printed circuit materials in north america were of the company s total net sales of printed circuit materials in north america  compared with for last fiscal year  and the company s net sales of such materials in asia and europe combined were of the company s total net sales of printed circuit materials in asia and europe combined  compared with for last fiscal year 
the company s cost of sales increased in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year in support of higher production volumes compared to the prior fiscal year  but decreased as a percentage of sales as a result of personnel reductions and cost savings resulting from the company s realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations  and other cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including workforce reductions and the reduction of overtime 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  as these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year resulted from the higher volume of sales  lower shipping costs incurred by the company to meet its customers customized manufacturing and quick turn around requirements and cost reductions resulting from the realignment of the company s volume printed circuit materials operations 
in the fiscal year third quarter  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million resulting from the settlement of an insurance claim for property and business interruption losses sustained by the company in singapore as a result of an explosion in november in one of the four treaters located at its nelco manufacturing facility in singapore 
in the same quarter  the company also recorded pre tax charges of million for severance payments resulting from workforce reductions at the company s north american and european fr business operations 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from the sale of real estate in skelmersdale  england previously used by its nelco uk subsidiary  which had ceased operations after its closure in the fiscal year third quarter  and a pre tax gain of million during the fiscal year second quarter related to the payment by delco of the judgment against delco in favor of the company s subsidiary  nti  in its lawsuit against delco 
the company also recorded pre tax charges totaling million in the fiscal year first and second quarters in connection with the realignment of its north american fr business operations and related workforce reductions 
the net pre tax gain for all these items for the fiscal year was million  and the net after tax gain for the fiscal year was million 
interest and other income  net  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was attributable to an increase in cash available for investment and higher prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments 
the company incurred no interest expense during the  or fiscal years 
see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year compared to for the fiscal year 
the company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations  excluding the pre tax gains and the pre tax charges described above  for the fiscal year was compared to for the fiscal year 
for the reasons set forth above  the company s net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year  including the pre tax gain described above resulting from the insurance settlement and the pre tax charges described above for severance payments resulting from workforce reductions  were million compared with net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year of million  including the pre tax gains described above resulting from the sale of real estate in england and the payment by delco of the judgment in favor of nti and the pre tax charges described above related to the realignment of the company s north american fr business operations and related workforce reductions 
the net impacts of the gains and the charges described above were to increase the net earnings from continuing operations by million for the fiscal year and by million for the fiscal year 
the company reported net earnings of million for the fiscal year  including the gain and charges described above  and a net loss of million for the fiscal year  including the gains and charges described above and the loss from the discontinued dielektra operations 
basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  including the gain and charges described above  were and per share  respectively  for the fiscal year compared to basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of and per share  respectively  including the gains and charges described above  for the fiscal year 
the net impacts of the gains and charges described above were to increase the basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by for the fiscal year and by for the fiscal year 
the basic and diluted losses per share were and  respectively  for the fiscal year  including losses from the discontinued dielektra operations of and per share  respectively  and the pre tax gains and charges described above 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s volume printed circuit materials operations in north america and europe continued to be weak during the fiscal year ended february  as the north american  european and  to a lesser extent  asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials continued to experience depressed conditions 
nevertheless  the company s continuing operations generated a profit during the fiscal year as a result of a significant improvement in the company s gross profit 
the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was substantially higher than the gross profit in the prior fiscal year and improved significantly in the six months ended february  as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales by the company of its higher margin  advanced technology printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials 
these improvements in gross profits occurred despite slightly lower levels of sales of printed circuit materials in the fiscal year and only slightly increased sales in the third and fourth quarters  operating inefficiencies resulting from operating certain facilities at levels far below their designed manufacturing capacities and from the company s realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations  and competitive pressures 
the company s financial results of operations were substantially enhanced by the pre tax gain of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year second quarter related to the payment by delco of the judgment against delco in favor of nti in its lawsuit against delco  which more than offset the pre tax charges of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year related to the company s realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations in the first and second quarters 
in the fiscal year  the company reclassified dielektra s operating losses and charges and accordingly recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million as a result of the company s discontinuation of its financial support of dielektra in february  the ensuing insolvency of dielektra  and the company s treatment of dielektra as a discontinued operation 
the net loss from discontinued operations was comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra  million related to the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation and related workforce reductions in the fiscal year first quarter and million for the write off of assets of dielektra and other costs 
in the fiscal year  the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million for after tax fixed asset impairment charges 
operating results of the company s advanced composite materials business also improved significantly during the fiscal year primarily as a result of increased sales and higher percentages of sales of higher margin products 
results of operations net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended february  declined less than to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales from continuing operations was principally the result of lower unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s volume printed circuit materials operations in north america and europe  almost entirely offset by higher unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s operations in asia 
the company s sales from continuing operations did not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year and of total sales worldwide from continuing operating during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year due to increases in sales in asia and france while sales by the company s operations in england were nil during the fiscal year 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide continuing operations improved to during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin was attributable to higher percentages of sales of higher margin  advanced technology printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials  as high temperature printed circuit materials accounted for of total net printed circuit material worldwide sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year  and reductions in the company s costs from the fiscal year  which were only partially offset by lower sales volumes and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities 
the company s cost of sales decreased in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to personnel reductions and cost savings resulting from the company s realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations  other cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including workforce reductions and the reduction of overtime  and lower production volumes during the first and second quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition  the company continued to implement an annual salary freeze for significant numbers of salaried employees  especially senior management employees  and paid no performance bonuses or significantly reduced bonuses and other incentives 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  and these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year was a result of increased shipping costs incurred by the company to meet its customers customized manufacturing and quick turn around requirements 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from the sale of real estate in skelmersdale  england previously used by its nelco uk subsidiary  which ceased operations after its closure in the fiscal year third quarter  and a pre tax gain of million during the fiscal year second quarter related to the payment by delco of the judgment against delco in favor of nti in its lawsuit against delco 
the company also recorded pre tax charges totaling million in the fiscal year first and second quarters in connection with the realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations and related workforce reductions 
the net pre tax gain for all these items for the fiscal year was million  and the net after tax gain for the fiscal year was million 
in the fiscal year fourth quarter  the company recorded pre tax  fixed asset impairment charges of million related to the write downs of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america 
the after tax impact of these fixed asset impairments was million

liquidity and capital resources at february   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at february   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the company s working capital which includes cash and temporary investments was million at february  compared with million at february  the increase in working capital at february  compared with february  was due principally to higher inventories and lower accrued liabilities  offset in part by higher income taxes payable 
the increase in inventories at february  compared with february  was attributable mainly to an increase in raw material stocks required by higher production and sales volumes  especially fibercote s sales of advanced composite materials for aerospace applications  during the fiscal year 
the lower accrued liabilities were the result principally of the elimination of the reserve for self insured medical costs resulting from the substitution of a fully insured medical program for the self insured program and the reduction in the restructuring accrual due to payments made during the fiscal year 
the increase in income taxes payable was attributable mainly to the receipt of a million income tax refund during the first quarter of the fiscal year

the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future

in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties

critical accounting policies and estimates in response to financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other employee benefit programs  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized at the time title to product is transferred to a customer 
all material sales transactions are for the shipment of manufactured prepreg and laminate products and advanced composite materials 
the company ships its products to customers based upon firm orders  with fixed selling prices  when collection is reasonably assured 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s products are made to customer specifications and tested for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers 
there are no future performance requirements other than the products meeting the agreed specifications 
the company s bases for providing sales allowances for returns are known situations in which products may have failed due to manufacturing defects in the products supplied by the company 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
the amounts of returns and allowances resulting from defective or damaged products have been approximately of sales for each of the company s last three fiscal years 
allowance for bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly

the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
pension and other employee benefit programs dielektra has significant pension costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and wage inflation rates 
the pension liability of dielektra has been included in liabilities from discontinued operations on the company s balance sheet 
the company s obligations for workers compensation claims are effectively self insured 
the company uses an insurance company administrator to process all such claims and benefits 
the company accrues its workers compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator and historical experience 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries have a non contributory profit sharing retirement plan covering their regular full time employees 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries have various bonus and incentive compensation programs  some of which are determined at management s discretion 
the company s reserves associated with these self insured liabilities and benefit programs are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each quarterly reporting period
