item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer and builder of single family homes in the rapidly growing southern and western united states based on the number of home closings and revenue 
we focus on providing a broad range of first time  move up  active adult and luxury homes to our targeted customer base 
we believe that the relatively strong population  job and income growth as well as the favorable migration characteristics of our markets will continue to provide significant growth opportunities for us 
at december   we were actively selling homes in communities  with base prices ranging from  to  we achieved record home closings  home sales  revenues and net earnings in home closing revenue increased in to billion and net earnings increased to million 
in addition  in we closed  homes  up from and we received  new orders for homes  up from at december   we have  homes in backlog up from  with a value of billion 
in general  we focus on minimizing land risk by purchasing property only after full entitlements have been obtained and typically begin development or construction immediately after close 
we acquire land primarily through rolling option contracts  allowing us to purchase individual lots as our building needs dictate 
these arrangements allow us to control lot inventory typically on a non recourse basis without incurring the risks of land ownership or financial commitments other than relatively small non refundable deposits 
at december   we owned or had options to acquire approximately  housing lots  of which approximately were under rolling option and land purchase contracts 
we believe that the lots we own or have the right to acquire represent an approximate five year supply  and that we are well positioned for future growth 
we have completed seven acquisitions over the last seven years  including our february acquisition of colonial homes 
our recent acquisitions have provided us with an entry into important new markets 
our acquisition of perma bilt homes provided us entry into the fast growing las vegas market and our january acquisition of citation homes of southern california provided us entry into the los angeles metro area market  which is the second largest single family housing market in the united states 
our acquisition of hancock phoenix and tucson and our acquisition of hammonds homes dallas  houston and austin have strengthened our positions in our important arizona and texas markets 
we began start up operations in the high growth markets of denver  colorado and orlando  florida in and we believe that these new geographic markets possess demographic and growth characteristics that meet our growth criteria 
we expect closings to begin in these markets toward the latter half of in march we announced our entry into the reno  nevada market through a start up operation 
we plan to begin delivering homes in reno in mid in february we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the homebuilding assets of colonial homes of fort myers naples  florida 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash plus the assumption of accrued liabilities of approximately million 
in addition  we have the right to acquire approximately  lots over a four year period pursuant to an option agreement entered into between meritage and colonial 
we anticipate that the colonial acquisition will allow us to expand our presence in the florida market 
in addition to single family homes  colonial homes is also involved in the construction and sale of multi story condominiums 
we plan to develop condominium units in our fort myers naples market  and we are exploring expanding into condominium construction and sales in other markets in which we operate 
in february we announced a series of refinancing transactions that we believe will enhance our liquidity and  in the long term  result in significant cash interest savings to the company 
on march   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
on march   we completed the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to the company  after commissions  discounts and fees of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from these transactions to repurchase pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due in connection with this tender officer and repurchase  we will report in the first quarter of fiscal a one time charge of approximately million for premiums  commissions and expenses associated with the tender offer and the write off of existing offering costs associated with the senior notes  net of the accretion of existing note premiums on the senior notes and taxes 
approximately million of the senior notes remain outstanding and subject to tender until march  this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our judgments and assumptions on an on going basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  include our estimates of costs to complete our individual projects  the ultimate recoverability or impairment of these costs  goodwill impairment  the likelihood of closing lots held under option or contract  the ability to determine the fair value of consolidated real estate not owned and liabilities related to such  certain estimates and assumptions related to the application of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  and the ability to estimate expenses and accruals  including legal and warranty reserves 
should we under or over estimate costs to complete individual projects  gross margins in a particular period could be misstated and the ultimate recoverability of costs related to a project from home sales may be uncertain 
furthermore  non refundable deposits paid for land options or contracts may have no economic value to us if we do not ultimately purchase the land 
our inability to accurately estimate expenses  accruals  or an impairment of real estate or goodwill could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
the estimates and assumptions we make relating to our application of fin r  if not accurate  could result in us incorrectly including or excluding certain contractual land acquisition arrangements as variable interest entities in  or from  respectively  our consolidated financial statements 
home closing revenue  home orders and order backlog the tables provided below show operating and financial data regarding our homebuilding activities dollars in thousands 
years ended december  home closing revenue total dollars homes closed average sales price texas dollars homes closed average sales price arizona dollars homes closed average sales price california dollars homes closed average sales price nevada dollars homes closed average sales price home orders total dollars homes ordered average sales price texas dollars homes ordered average sales price arizona dollars homes ordered average sales price california dollars homes ordered average sales price nevada dollars homes ordered average sales price years ended december  order backlog total dollars homes in backlog average sales price texas dollars homes in backlog average sales price arizona dollars homes in backlog average sales price california dollars homes in backlog average sales price nevada dollars homes in backlog average sales price home closing revenue 
home closing revenue in increased to a company record of billion  compared to billion in contributing to our record year in home closing revenue was beginning with a record year end order backlog of million 
additionally  our record high home closing revenue benefited from a increase in the average sales price of homes closed and a increase in the number of homes closed led by our arizona and california regions where the housing markets are very strong in general and where we believe we have honed our competitive advantage 
we have benefited from continued strong demand in our markets where we have positioned ourselves to have the right product at the right price and in the right locations 
we increased the number of actively selling communities through organic growth as well as our january acquisition of citation homes in the southern california market 
the number of closings in our texas region increased to  in  reflecting somewhat more competitive market conditions 
our arizona region posted a increase in the number of homes closed in to  the increase in arizona is primarily due to the increase in closings of more affordable homes in arizona  particularly in our active adult communities in arizona  representing a shift in our historical product mix in this market 
the average closing price per home in arizona declined in as a result of this shift in product mix 
our california region  which offers our highest priced homes  posted an increase in the number of homes closed  resulting in an increase in home closing revenue in the increase in home closings in california is primarily due to a generally strong housing market and a increase in actively selling communities 
in nevada  closings were off moderately for the year because we sold out of several communities faster than anticipated in  before our replacement communities were open for sales 
in  we benefited from increasingly positive demographic factors in the southern and western united states  an increasing home ownership rate and favorable employment statistics 
home closing revenue in increased over  resulting primarily from a increase in the number of homes closed and a increase in the average sales price year over year 
we benefited from an increase in the number of communities that closed homes  from continued strong demand for homes and from an overall increase in the us home ownership rate in  which was at an all time high of at the end of the year 
the number of home closings in texas increased to  from  mainly representing the full year impact of our mid year hammonds acquisition 
while the slower demand experienced in both our austin and monterey phoenix divisions in stabilized in  the number of home closings in california was up in  resulting from the strong california homebuilding market and an increase in actively selling communities 
the number of homes closed in nevada increased from to  due to the full year impact in of our fourth quarter acquisition of perma bilt 
somewhat offsetting these increases was a reduction in the number of home closings in arizona of  due to the earlier than anticipated sell out of some communities and delays in opening their replacements 
the overall increase in the average home closing price was primarily the result of a shift in mix toward our higher priced homes  particularly in california 
as a whole  we benefited from positive demographic factors  an historically high home ownership rate and generally favorable employment statistics 
home orders 
home orders for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include orders contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
historically  we have experienced a cancellation rate of approximately of the gross sales  which we believe is consistent with industry norms 
we ended the fiscal year with  homes ordered compared to  representing a increase in home orders 
our arizona and california regions posted particularly strong results  primarily due to healthy housing markets in both states as well as communities that are thoughtfully designed  in good locations and that meet the needs of our homebuyers 
orders in arizona rose due to newly opened communities and the diversification of our product offerings to take advantage of emerging demographic trends such as maturing baby boomers in the form of active adult communities 
our active adult communities generated sales orders in  as compared to in in california  sales orders increased primarily due to an increase in active communities in northern california  the acquisition of citation homes in january and continued strong demand for homes 
during the latter half of  we opened several new communities in nevada for sales  tripling our number of actively selling communities to six 
overall  our home orders in nevada declined to  but our fourth quarter orders reflected the increase in our actively selling communities by generating a increase in the quarter  year over year  which is evidence that the nevada housing market is strong 
the dollar value of sales contracts in increased over this increase was driven by a increase in the number of new home orders and a increase in average selling price 
the number of new home orders increased by in texas  a portion of which represents the full year impact of our hammonds acquisition 
the number of orders in arizona increased during  primarily the result of a increase in actively selling communities and continued strong demand for homes 
the number of orders in california was relatively stable  up over  reflecting the earlier than anticipated sellout of communities in the beginning of however  the number of orders was up in the fourth quarter of in california versus the prior year s fourth quarter  due to the introduction of new communities during the second half of new home orders increased in nevada from in to in  as a result of the full year impact of our perma bilt acquisition 
we believe the demand for our homes can be attributed in part to the continuing maturation of first and second generation baby boomers and increases in immigration to the south and west 
order backlog 
our backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
our optimism regarding is anchored in our very strong backlog at year end  and the market conditions and order flow driving that backlog 
as a result of the accelerating order momentum during the second half of  we ended with  homes in backlog  a increase compared to year end  resulting in a dollar backlog of billion for year end  an increase over year end in addition to a increase in the number of homes in order backlog  the increase in dollar backlog was also due to a increase in the average sales price of those homes 
our arizona region more than doubled their number of homes in backlog at the end of compared to  with an increase of 
in california  the number of units and average sales price of the units in backlog increased and  respectively  to units and million  primarily as a result of the increased active selling communities in northern california and also due to the acquisition of citation homes in january our nevada region ended with million in backlog  an increase of over year end  mainly due to a increase in the average selling price of homes in order backlog 
the price increase was primarily due to a strong housing market in nevada represented by our year end order backlog with higher priced selling communities compared to lower priced selling communities for year end in texas  our backlog increased to million at year end from year end  primarily due to an increase in unit orders of 
total dollar backlog at december  increased over the amount at year end due to a increase in the number of homes in backlog and a increase in the average sales price of those homes 
unit backlog was up in arizona and in california due to an increase in the number of communities and continued strong demand for homes in those markets during from year end to year end  the number of active communities in arizona and california increased and  respectively 
unit backlog in nevada increased at the end of  and the average home price in backlog increased due to a shift in product mix  resulting in the dollar value of backlog increasing by 
unit backlog in texas on december  was relatively in line with december   up 
however  the average selling price in backlog in texas increased  resulting in the dollar value of backlog increasing year over year 
other operating information years ended december  in thousands home closing gross profit dollars percent of home closing revenue commissions and other sales costs dollars percent of home closing revenue general and administrative expenses dollars percent of total revenue income taxes dollars percent of earnings before income taxes home closing gross profit 
home closing gross profit represents home closing revenue less cost of home closings 
cost of home closings include developed lot costs  direct home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
home closing gross profit as a percentage of home closing revenue was consistent in and at 
home closing gross profit as a percentage of home closing revenue was in  up from in this improvement can be attributed to home closing prices in increasing at a greater rate than cost of home closings 
average home closing prices were up in while the average cost of home closings increased by 
land closings 
the sale of land is not a significant component of our business plan and takes place occasionally as we sell excess land that is not needed in our homebuilding operations 
incidental sales of land may continue in the future  but could fluctuate substantially 
a summary of land closings is presented below years ended december  in thousands land closing revenue cost of land closings land closing gross profit land closings for the year ended december  primarily related to one land closing in nevada during the third quarter of for million  which resulted in a million gain 
commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  were of home closing revenue in  down from in this decrease was primarily the result of our ability to leverage our fixed and semi fixed sales and marketing costs with our increase in home closing revenue 
for the year ended december   commissions and other sales costs were of home closing revenue  up from in this increase was primarily the result of the rising use of independent brokers who are paid higher commissions than our employee brokers  along with costs associated with opening new communities for sale 
our marketing expenses are incurred in connection with the promotion of new communities  and these expenses are often incurred in advance of actual home closings  which tend to lag sales by a period of four to nine months 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative costs as a percent of total revenue remained relatively consistent in at of total revenue compared to for and income taxes 
income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  up from in this increase was mainly due to the increase in pre tax earnings in arizona and california  which have higher state tax rates than nevada and texas 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable for by approximately million  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  down from in this reduction was mainly due to the increase in pre tax earnings in texas and nevada  which have minimal or no state taxes 
also  the tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable by approximately million  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital for the year ended december  were for operating expenses  land and property purchases  lot development  home construction  the repurchase of common stock  income taxes  interest and investments in joint ventures 
we used a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
future cash flows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of closings includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
except for our specific performance options  none of these agreements require us to purchase lots 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts 
at december   we had entered into option purchase contracts with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note variable interest entities and consolidated real estate not owned in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in december we increased the capacity of our unsecured credit facility by million  raising the total commitment to million 
the facility is with a consortium of banks  led by guaranty bank and bank one  na 
the revised agreement also lengthened the term of the facility by months  extending the maturity date to may  and expanded the number of banks participating in the facility from seven to ten 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately million was outstanding in letters of credit that collateralize our obligations under various land purchase and other contracts 
after considering our most restrictive bank covenants  our borrowing availability under the bank credit facility was approximately million at december   as determined by borrowing base limitations defined by our agreement with the lending banks 
this credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including covenants requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million plus of net income earned since january  plus of the aggregate net increase in tangible net worth resulting from the sale of capital stock and other equity interests as defined  prohibiting our ratio of indebtedness including accrued expenses to tangible net worth from being greater than to  requiring us to maintain a ratio of ebitda including interest amortized to cost of sales to interest incurred as defined of at least to  prohibiting the net book value of our land and lots where construction of a home has not commenced to exceed of tangible net worth and prohibiting the net book value of our raw land where grading or infrastructure improvements have not begun to exceed of tangible net worth  limiting the number of unsold housing units and model units that we may have in our inventory at the end of any fiscal quarter as follows unsold homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and model homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and prohibiting us from entering into any sale and leaseback transaction  excluding the sale and leaseback of model homes and prohibiting us from creating or incurring any off balance sheet liability 
for purposes of our credit facility  off balance sheet liabilities include certain liabilities arising under asset securitization transactions  monetary obligations under synthetic leases  tax retention or off balance sheet lease transactions that upon the application of any debtor relief law to us would be characterized as indebtedness  any other monetary obligation with respect to any transaction which upon the application of any debtor relief law to us would be characterized as indebtedness or which is the functional equivalent of or takes the place of borrowing but which does not constitute a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
notwithstanding the above  our credit facility specifically provides that liabilities i under rolling options and similar contracts for the acquisition of real property and ii arising under model home leases  and iii liabilities arising under guarantees shall not be deemed off balance sheet liabilities 
we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  which were originally issued in may and subsequent add on financings in february and september in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due approximately million of this amount was used to pay down our senior unsecured credit facility 
the indentures for our senior notes and our senior notes require us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not apply to most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  non recourse indebtedness and other indebtedness up to million  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with the credit facility and senior note covenants 
in february we announced a series of refinancing transactions that we believe will enhance our liquidity and  in the long term  result in significant cash interest savings to the company 
on march   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
on march   we completed the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to the company  after commissions  discounts and fees of approximately million 
the indenture which governs the new senior notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the indentures which govern our existing senior notes and senior notes  except that  among other things  the new indenture does not require us to maintain a certail level of minimum tangible net worth  provides that the exceptions to the limitation of the amount of additional indebtedness we may acquire with respect to purchase money indebtedness and non recourse and other indebtedness is unlimited  provides that the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make is limited to million plus i of net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  increases the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the new indenture  and provides for a suspension of certain covenants if the new senior notes have investment grade ratings  as defined in the indenture  including covenants relating to change of control  limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interest and certain limitations on investments and asset sales 
on march   we used the proceeds from these transactions to repurchase pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due in connection with this tender offer and repurchase  we will report in the first quarter of fiscal a one time charge of approximately million for premiums  commissions and expenses associated with the tender offer and the write off of existing offering costs associated with the senior notes  net of the accretion of existing note premiums on the senior notes and taxes 
approximately million of the senior notes remain outstanding and subject to tender until march  we believe that our current borrowing capacity  cash on hand and anticipated net cash flows from operations are and will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we believe our future cash needs will include funds for the completion of projects that are underway  the maintenance of our day to day operations  and the acquisition or start up of additional homebuilding operations  should the opportunities arise 
there is no assurance  however  that future cash flows will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
the amount and types of indebtedness that we incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and by the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 
in august  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million  with an increase of million approved in january  to repurchase shares of our common stock 
by december   we had purchased  shares of our common stock under the august program at an average price of per share 
for the fiscal year ended december   we repurchased  shares at an average price of  completing the august program 
in august  the board of directors approved a new stock buyback program  authorizing the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   no shares were purchased under this program 
no date for completing the program has been determined  but we will purchase shares subject to applicable securities law  and at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate 
effective april   the construction costs and related debt associated with model homes which are owned and leased to us by others that we use to market our communities are included in our balance sheet 
we do not legally own the model homes  but we are reimbursed by the owner for our construction costs  and we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase these homes 
although we have no legal obligation to repay any amounts received from third party owners  the amounts are recorded as debt and are typically deemed repaid when we simultaneously exercise our option to purchase the model home and sell such model home to a third party home buyer 
should we elect not to exercise our rights to purchase these model homes  the model costs and related debt under the model home lease program will be eliminated upon the termination of the lease  which is generally between one and three years from the origination of the lease 
off balance sheet arrangements we often acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements 
this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
under these purchase agreements  we are usually required to make deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit  which may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement 
at december   we had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  by making deposits of approximately million in the form of cash and approximately million in letters of credit 
occasionally  we enter into land development joint ventures 
the company and or its partners occasionally provide limited repayment guarantees on debt of certain unconsolidated entities on a pro rata share basis 
at december   the company had limited repayment guarantees of million 
we and our joint venture partners are also typically obligated to the project lenders to complete land development improvements if the joint venture does not perform the required development 
provided we and the other joint venture partners are in compliance with these completion obligations  the project lenders would be obligated to fund these improvements through any financing commitments available under the applicable joint venture development and construction loans 
in addition  we and our joint venture partners have from time to time provided unsecured environmental indemnities to joint venture project lenders 
in some instances  these indemnities are subject to caps 
these indemnities obligate us to reimburse the project lenders only for claims related to environmental matters for which such lenders are held responsible 
as part of our project acquisition due diligence process to determine potential environmental risks  we generally obtain an independent environmental review from outside consultants 
additionally  we and our joint venture partners have agreed to indemnify third party surety providers with respect to performance bonds issued on behalf of certain of our joint ventures 
if a joint venture does not perform its obligations  the surety bond could be called 
if these surety bonds are called and the joint venture fails to reimburse the surety  we and our joint venture partners would be obligated to indemnify the surety 
these surety indemnity arrangements are generally joint and several obligations with our other joint venture partners 
as of december   there were approximately million of surety bonds outstanding subject to these indemnity arrangements 
none of these bonds have been called to date and we believe it is unlikely that any of these bonds will be called 
we also obtain letters of credit and performance  maintenance  and other bonds in support of our related obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies depending on the stage and level of our development activities 
in the event the letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million in performance bonds for such purposes 
we believe it is unlikely that any of these letters of credit or bonds will be drawn upon 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years principal  senior notes interest  senior notes other borrowing obligations interest  other borrowing obligations operating lease obligations specific performance option obligations total as a part of our model home construction activities  we enter into lease transactions with third parties  the monthly payments for which are typically calculated by applying a libor based rate to the agreed upon basis of the leased asset 
as discussed in note  at december   approximately million of these transactions were included in our balance sheet as model home inventory with a corresponding debt balance  which is included in the other borrowings category above 
the portion of the lease payments relating to that debt is included in the above table in interest  other borrowing obligations 
the remainder of the lease payments relating to the model home leases and other operating leases is included in the operating lease obligations category 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or seasonality we historically close more homes in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half  due in part to the slightly seasonal nature of the market for our move up and luxury products 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue  although it may vary as our operations continue to expand

is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect our future results and financial condition future operating results and financial condition depend on our ability to successfully design  develop  construct and sell homes that satisfy dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are factors that we must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
these operating and financial factors  along with many other factors  could affect the price of our common stock and notes 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results and financial condition could include the factors discussed below 
interest rates and mortgage financing 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs and the unavailability of mortgage financing 
most of our buyers finance their home purchases through third party lenders providing mortgage financing 
if mortgage interest rates increase and  consequently  the ability of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely affected  home sales  gross margins and cash flow may also be adversely affected and the impact may be material 
interest rates are currently near historically low levels  however  it is impossible to predict future increases or decreases in market interest rates 
in addition  homebuilding activities depend upon the availability and costs of mortgage financing for buyers of homes owned by potential customers  as those customers move up buyers often must sell their residences before they purchase our homes 
any reduction of financing availability could adversely affect home sales 
future expansion 
we may continue to consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in other areas of the country 
our expansion into new or existing markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or profitability 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future expansion will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
new acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations  the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities or expenses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
dependence on subcontractors 
we conduct our construction operations only as a general contractor 
virtually all architectural and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our homes 
we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
in addition  inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse affect on our business 
operating and financial limitations 
the indentures for our senior notes and the agreement for our senior unsecured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness or liens  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase our stock  make investments  sell assets  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the indentures for our senior notes and our senior unsecured credit facility require us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and our credit facility requires us to maintain other specified financial ratios 
we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
colonial homes acquisition 
in february we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the homebuilding operations of colonial homes of fort myers naples  florida 
the integration of colonial homes into our operations following the acquisition will involve a number of risks 
in particular  the combined companies may experience attrition among management and personnel 
the integration process could also disrupt the activities of our current business 
the combination of the two companies will require  among other things  coordination of management  administrative and other functions 
failure to overcome these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition of colonial homes could cause our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position to decline 
our integration of the colonial homes acquisition assumes certain synergies and other benefits 
we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the intended benefits of the acquisition in whole or in part 
in connection with the acquisition of colonial  we will be involved in the construction and sale of multi story condominium homes 
prior to this acquisition  our business has involved only the construction and sale of single family homes 
the construction and sale of condominium homes involves different construction processes and subcontractors and  to a degree  different customers 
in addition  condominium homes typically involve more extensive sales and warranty regulations 
although we now employ most of the colonial homes employees that were involved with the colonial business including condominium construction and sales  we have no prior experience in the condominium business 
in addition  we are exploring expanding into condominium construction and sales in other markets in which we operate and we would face similar challenges and risk with such an endeavor 
dependence on key personnel 
our success largely depends on the continuing services of certain key employees  including our co chief executive officers  john r 
landon and steven j 
hilton  and our continued development depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we have employment agreements with messrs 
landon and hilton  but we do not have employment agreements with certain other key employees 
we believe that messrs 
landon and hilton each possess valuable industry knowledge  experience and leadership abilities that would be difficult in the short term to replicate 
the loss of the services of key employees could harm our operations and business plans 
limited geographic diversification 
we have operations in texas  arizona  california  nevada  colorado and florida 
our limited geographic diversification could adversely impact us if the homebuilding business in our current markets should decline  since there may not be a balancing opportunity in a stronger market in other geographic regions 
increased insurance costs 
recently  lawsuits have been filed against builders asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential dwellings 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
we believe that we have maintained adequate insurance coverage to insure against these types of claims for homes completed before october  insurance carriers have been excluding claims from policies arising from the presence of mold for many builders and  as of october   our insurance policy began excluding mold coverage 
if our retentions are not sufficient to protect against these types of claims or if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could result if we are exposed to claims arising from the presence of mold in the homes that we sell 
natural disasters 
we have significant homebuilding operations in texas  california and florida 
some of our markets in texas and florida occasionally experience extreme weather conditions such as tornadoes or hurricanes 
california has experienced a significant number of earthquakes  flooding  landslides and other natural disasters in recent years 
we do not insure against some of these risks 
these occurrences could damage or destroy some of our homes under construction or our building lots  which may result in losses that exceed our insurance coverage 
we could also suffer significant construction delays or substantial fluctuations in the pricing or availability of building materials 
any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue  cash flows and earnings 
inflation 
we  like other homebuilders  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  mainly because of higher land and construction costs 
also  higher mortgage interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective buyers 
inflation increases our cost of financing  materials and labor and could cause our financial results or growth to decline 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers through higher sales prices 
to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  inflation could impact our future operating results 
home warranty factors 
construction defect and home warranty claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
while we maintain product liability insurance and generally require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work  we cannot assure you that these insurance rights and indemnities will be adequate to cover all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be held liable 
for example  we may be responsible for applicable self insured retentions  which have increased recently  and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits 
homebuilding industry factors 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in economic and other conditions such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
these factors can negatively affect demand for and cost of our homes 
we are also subject to various risks  many of which are outside of our control  including delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in governmental regulations such as no or slow growth initiatives  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  and raw materials and labor costs 
we are also subject to the potential for significant variability and fluctuations in the cost and availability of real estate 
although historically we have generally developed parcels ranging from to lots  in order to achieve and maintain an adequate inventory of lots  we are beginning to purchase larger parcels  in some cases with a joint venture partner 
write downs of our real estate could occur if market conditions deteriorate and these write downs could be material in amount 
write downs may also occur if we purchase land at higher prices during stronger economic periods and the value of that land subsequently declines during slower economic periods 
fluctuations in operating results 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in home sales and net earnings on a quarterly basis 
as a result of such variability  our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results 
factors that contribute to this variability include timing of home deliveries and land sales  our ability to acquire additional land or options for additional land on acceptable terms  conditions of the real estate market in areas where we operate and of the general economy  the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  changes in prevailing interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  costs and availability of materials and labor  and delays in construction schedules due to strikes  adverse weather  acts of god  reduced subcontractor availability and governmental restrictions 
competition 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete for sales in each of our markets with national  regional and local developers and homebuilders  existing home resales and  to a lesser extent  condominiums and available rental housing 
if we are unable to successfully compete  our financial results and growth could suffer 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources or lower costs than we do 
competition among both small and large residential homebuilders is based on a number of interrelated factors  including location  reputation  amenities  design  quality and price 
competition is expected to continue and become more intense  and there may be new entrants in the markets in which we currently operate and in markets we may enter in the future 
additional financing  limitations 
the homebuilding industry is capital intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
accordingly  we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities 
at december   we had approximately million of indebtedness and other borrowings 
if we require working capital greater than that provided by operations or available under our credit facility  we may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including bank financing and securities offerings 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as capital expenditures  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations 
if we do not have sufficient funds  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow additional funds 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives 
government regulations  environmental conditions 
regulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant liabilities and costs and could restrict our business activities 
we are subject to local  state and federal statutes and rules regulating certain developmental matters  as well as building and site design 
we are subject to various fees and charges of government authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements 
we may be subject to additional costs and delays or may be precluded entirely from building projects because of no growth or slow growth initiatives  building permit ordinances  building moratoriums  or similar government regulations that could be imposed in the future due to health  safety  welfare or environmental concerns 
we must also obtain licenses  permits and approvals from government agencies to engage in certain activities  the granting or receipt of which are beyond our control  but could cause delays in our homebuilding projects 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
environmental laws or permit restrictions may result in project delays  may cause substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or geographic areas 
environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials  such as lumber 
beginning in late  we established relationships with title insurance companies in three states where we do business  pursuant to which one of our subsidiaries receives a portion of the fees and premiums on title insurance purchase by certain of our homebuyers and reinsures a portion of the policy risk 
the california insurance commissioner and regulators in other states are investigating these types of arrangements 
we are in the process of terminating those arrangements that have not been expressly approved by a state regulator 
in total  these arrangements contributed approximately  to our fiscal pre tax earnings 
acts of war 
acts of war or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power  including the conflict with iraq  may cause disruption to the economy  our company  our employees and our customers  which could impact our revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
special note of caution regarding forward looking statements in passing the private securities litigation reform act of pslra  congress encouraged public companies to make forward looking statements by creating a safe harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward looking statements 
we intend to qualify both our written and oral forward looking statements for protection under the pslra 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  forecast  plan  and project and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
all statements other than of historical fact are forward looking statements and are within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements in this annual report and form k include statements concerning the demand for and the pricing of our homes  the growth potential of the markets we operate in  our acquisition strategy  positive demographic and other trends related to the homebuilding industry in general and our ability to capitalize on them  the future supply of housing inventory in our markets and the homebuilding industry in general  our ability to renew existing leases on comparable terms  our expectation that existing letters of credit and performance bonds will not be drawn on  the adequacy of our insurance coverage and warranty reserves  our ability to deliver existing backlog  the expected outcome of legal proceedings against us  the sufficiency of our capital resources to support our growth strategy  the future impact of deferred tax assets or liabilities  the expectation of continued positive operating results in and beyond and the expected benefits of our acquisitions 
such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements  and that could negatively affect our business are discussed in this report under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results and financial condition 
forward looking statements express expectations of future events 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to these inherent uncertainties  the investment community is urged not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
in addition  we undertake no obligations to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of anticipated events or changes to projections over time 
as a result of these and other factors  our stock and note prices may fluctuate dramatically 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and eurodollar lending rates 
at december   we had no advances drawn under our revolving credit facility that would be subject to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of our million in principal of our senior notes and million of our senior notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to refinance such debt 
the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
information regarding interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity and average interest rates for the years ended december  and follows december  for the years ended december  thereafter total fair value at december  dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a variable rate b b average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is based on quoted market prices by independent dealers 
b amount relates to our model home lease program 
although we have no legal obligation to repay this amount  generally accepted accounting principles require we include this liability and a related asset in our consolidated financial statements 
the lease payments required under this program are based on libor per annum  which is comparable to current market rates  therefore the cost basis approximates fair value 
no amounts were outstanding at december  relating to our revolving credit facility which carries a variable interest rate of libor plus or prime 
december  for the years ended december  thereafter total fair value at december  dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a variable rate b b average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is based on quoted market prices by independent dealers 
b our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate of libor plus or prime  which is comparable to current market rates  therefore the cost basis approximates fair value 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
