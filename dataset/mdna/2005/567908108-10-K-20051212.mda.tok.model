potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues  including in some cases  management succession and related matters 
as a result of these and other factors  a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated

application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from boat  motor  and trailer sales and parts  service  and storage operations at the time the boat  motor  trailer  or part is delivered to or accepted by the customer or service is completed 
we recognize commissions earned from a brokerage sale at the time the related brokerage transaction closes 
we recognize revenue from slip and storage services on a straight line basis over the term of the slip or storage agreement 
we recognize commissions earned by us for placing notes with financial institutions in connection with customer boat financing when the related boat sales are recognized 
we also recognize marketing fees earned on credit life  accident and disability  and hull insurance products sold by third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the insurance product as evidenced by contract execution  or when the related boat sale is recognized 
we also recognize commissions earned on extended warranty service contracts sold on behalf of third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the service contract terms as evidenced by contract execution  or recognition of the related boat sale 
certain finance and extended warranty commissions and marketing fees on insurance products may be charged back if a customer terminates or defaults on the underlying contract within a specified period of time 
based upon 
table of contents our experience of terminations and defaults  we maintain a chargeback allowance that was not material to our financial statements taken as a whole as of september  or should results differ materially from our historical experiences  we would need to modify our estimate of future chargebacks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
vendor consideration received in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf establishes the accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of cash consideration paid by a vendor to a reseller 
eitf is effective for interim period financial statements beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
in march  the eitf revised certain provisions of its previously reached conclusions on eitf and provided additional transitional guidance 
eitf does not provide for restatement or reclassification of prior year amounts  rather  it requires prospective application for new agreements or modifications of existing agreements entered into subsequent to december  we determined that eitf impacted our accounting for certain consideration received from vendors beginning july  with the renewal of and amendments to our dealer agreements with the manufacturers of our products 
eitf most significantly requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders 
also  based on the requirements of our co op assistance programs from our manufacturers  eitf permits the netting of the assistance against related advertising expenses 
we adopted eitf prospectively for fiscal during the quarter ended december  had we been required to adopt eitf at the beginning of fiscal  approximately million of interest assistance that was originally recorded as a reduction of interest expense would have been accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales 
inventories inventory costs consist of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  net of vendor consideration and purchase discounts  the cost of equipment added  reconditioning costs  and transportation costs relating to relocating inventory prior to sale 
new and used boat  motor  and trailer inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a specific identification basis  or market 
parts and accessories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out basis  or market 
if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to reflect fair value 
we utilize our historical experience and current sales trends as the basis for our lower of cost or market analysis 
if events occur and market conditions change  causing the fair value to fall below carrying value  further reductions may be required 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets and reported separately from goodwill 
we have determined that our most significant acquired identifiable intangible assets are dealer agreements  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of goodwill or an identifiable intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss 
we measure any potential impairment based on various business valuation methodologies  including a projected discounted cash flow method 
we completed our last annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on financial information as of the third quarter of fiscal  which resulted in no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in the application of sfas 
table of contents we will continue to test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
prior to the adoption of sfas  all purchase price in excess of the net tangible assets was recorded as goodwill and no identifiable intangible assets were recognized 
net goodwill and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million and million  respectively  at september  the most significant estimates used in our goodwill valuation model include estimates of the future growth in our cash flows and future working capital needs to support our projected growth 
should circumstances change causing these assumptions to differ materially than expected  our goodwill may become impaired  resulting in a material adverse effect on our operating margins

this increase in boat and yacht sales on a comparable store basis helped generated an increase in revenue from our parts  service  finance  and insurance products of approximately million 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margins on boat sales and improvements in service  finance  insurance  parts  and brokerage revenues  which generally yield higher gross margins than boat sales

this decrease incurred by our comparable store locations resulted from the leveraging of our operating expense structure  which resulted in 
table of contents decreases in personnel costs and fixed expenses as a percentage of revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate million increase in marketing expenses associated with achieving our level of comparable store sales growth  the addition and expansion of various product lines  increases in inventory maintenance costs related to support our increase in comparable store sales and the addition and expansion of various product lines  and an increase in our accrued litigation expense related to a single lawsuit award that we are currently appealing 
additionally  the reduction of the comparable store expenses was partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with stores opened or acquired that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base 
these opened or acquired stores generally operate at a higher expense structure than our other locations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of a less favorable interest rate environment  which accounted for approximately million of the increase  coupled with an increase in the average borrowings associated with our revolving credit facility and mortgages  which accounted for approximately income tax provision

gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately basis points as a result of the implementation of eitf  which requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to additional expenses  including marketing  incurred by our comparable store locations associated with the comparable store sales increase and approximately  to protect and repair our facilities and inventories from hurricanes in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was attributable to additional leveraging of our expense structure resulting from our comparable store sales increase  partially offset by the hurricane related expenses and stores opened or acquired that operate at a higher expense structure than our other locations 

table of contents interest expense

income tax provision 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  as a result of increased earnings 
our effective tax rate decreased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  as a result of a review of our effective tax rate calculation for the jurisdictions in which we currently operate 
quarterly data and seasonality our business  as well as the entire recreational boating industry  is highly seasonal  with seasonality varying in different geographic markets 
with the exception of florida  we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories  and related short term borrowings  in the quarterly periods ending december and march the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in january stimulates boat sales and allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
our business could become substantially more seasonal as we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the united states 
our business is also subject to weather patterns  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels or excessive rain  may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient  thereby curtailing customer demand for our products 
in addition  unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations 
hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities  as was the case during the and hurricane season when florida and other markets were affected by numerous hurricanes 
although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area  these conditions will continue to represent potential  material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for each of our last eight quarters 
the information has been derived from unaudited financial statements that we believe reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for the fair presentation of such quarterly financial information

we regularly monitor the aging of our inventories and current market trends to evaluate our current and future inventory needs 
we also use this evaluation in conjunction with our review of our current and expected operating performance and expected growth to determine the adequacy of our financing needs 
these cash needs have historically been financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our line of credit facility 
we currently depend upon dividends and other payments from our consolidated operating subsidiaries  and our line of credit facility to fund our current operations and meet our cash needs 
currently  no agreements exist that restrict this flow of funds from our operating subsidiaries 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operating activities approximated million

for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from common shares issued through the february public offering  upon the exercise of stock options  and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayments of long term debt 
as of september   our indebtedness totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was associated with our real estate holdings and million was associated with financing our inventory and working capital needs 
during february  we entered into an amended and restated credit and security agreement with four financial institutions 
the credit facility provides us a line of credit with asset based borrowing availability of up to million for working capital inventory financing  with the amount of permissible borrowings determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula 
the credit facility also permits approved vendor floorplan borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility accrues interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus to basis points  with the interest rate based upon the ratio of our net outstanding borrowings to our tangible net worth 
the credit facility is secured by our inventory  accounts receivable  equipment  furniture  and fixtures 
the credit facility requires us to satisfy certain covenants  including maintaining a leverage ratio tied to our tangible net worth 
the credit facility matures in march  with two one year renewal options remaining 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants 
prior to the february amended and restated credit and security agreement  our line of credit provided us with asset based borrowing availability of up to million for working capital and inventory financing and permitted million in approved vendor floorplan borrowings  all of which were determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula 
the facility bore interest at libor plus to basis points  which was determined in accordance with a performance pricing grid  as defined in the credit facility 
the credit facility required us to satisfy certain covenants  including maintaining a tangible net worth ratio 
during the fiscal years ended september    and  we completed the acquisition of five marine retail operations 
we acquired the net assets  related property  and buildings and assumed or retired certain liabilities  including the outstanding floorplan obligations related to new boat inventories  for approximately million in cash  including acquisition costs 
except as specified in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements  we have no material commitments for capital for the next months 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months  except for possible significant acquisitions 

table of contents contractual commitments and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  year ending line of long term operating september  credit debt leases total amounts in thousands thereafter total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   approximately of our short and long term debt bore interest at variable rates  generally tied to a reference rate such as the libor rate or the prime rate of interest of certain banks 
changes in interest rates on loans from these financial institutions could affect our earnings as a result of interest rates charged on certain underlying obligations that are variable 
at september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate obligations would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in annual pre tax interest expense 
this estimated increase is based upon the outstanding balances of all of our variable rate obligations and assumes no mitigating changes by us to reduce the outstanding balances or additional interest assistance that would be received from vendors due to the hypothetical interest rate increase 
products purchased from the italy based ferretti group are subject to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate  which ultimately may impact the retail price at which we can sell such products 
accordingly  fluctuations in the value of the euro as compared with the us dollar may impact the price points at which we can sell profitably ferretti group products  and such price points may not be competitive with other product lines in the united states 
accordingly  such fluctuations in exchange rates ultimately may impact the amount of revenue  cost of goods sold  cash flows  and earnings we recognize for the ferretti group product line 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure that could have a significant impact on our operations 
if and when we do engage in material foreign currency exchange hedging transactions  we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations
