item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations for purposes of financial reporting  the company operates in two industry segments the fuller brands segment  which is involved in developing  manufacturing  distributing  and marketing branded consumer and commercial cleaning and personal care products in north america and internationally  and the cpac imaging segment  which includes the company s color photographic  health care  and graphic arts imaging operations in the united states  belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand 
the products of each segment are manufactured and marketed both in the us and in other parts of the world 
sales between segments are not material 
the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended march  include an after tax charge of per diluted share for an impairment loss recognized on an investment it owned  an after tax charge of per diluted share for its equity in losses of tura see note to the consolidated financial statements  and an after tax charge of per diluted share for the recognition of a valuation reserve on its consolidated deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended march  include an after tax charge of per diluted share for the imaging restructuring initiative see note to the consolidated financial statements  an after tax charge of per diluted share for its equity in losses from tura  ag of duren  west germany now required to be recognized due to the change in accounting as a result of cpac s increased ownership  and an after tax charge of per diluted share related to the recognition of an impairment loss on the company s investment in tura see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding tura charges 
net sales the company s net sales decreased in as compared to and in as compared to decreased and  respectively  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange 
for the fuller brands segment  net sales for fiscal increased as compared to the fuller brush operation continued its exceptional performance with sales increases of compared to continued growth in fuller s home shopping business  coupled with sales from its newly launched retail initiatives  drove the strong increase 
stanley home products net sales declined in as compared to in fiscal  stanley continued the process of updating its product packaging  product offering  and independent representative compensation plan to attract new recruits 
recruiting numbers improved as a result  but not significantly enough to offset attrition of older field sales leaders 
the new compensation plan was introduced in a high growth hispanic area of the country  and after a six to twelve month learning curve  has been successfully adopted 
stanley is focused on implementing the plan in another hispanic region of the country in fiscal and on using it to open new green field territories 
given the rate of attrition and acceptance of change by the current field  the company expects improvement to be gradual 
cleaning technologies group net sales also declined in as compared to  primarily from lower sales to distributors and continued reductions in its existing kmart business 
the operation remains focused on expanding nationwide coverage through manufacturing representative agencies that are currently being trained 
national accounts business  with longer selling cycles  has been slower to realize  and year to date gains have not offset the decline in kmart business 
ctg has successfully introduced a line of environmental green cleaning products and continues to focus on new products to meet floor care needs for safety  convenience  and value 
the commercial cleaning industry is considered to be fragmented  and the company believes there are opportunities to acquire or partner with other firms to strengthen its competitive position in the marketplace 
for the fuller brands segment  net sales for decreased as compared to fuller experienced a net sales decline for as compared to the decline was largely attributable to a decrease in certain private label business  lessened by an increase in the home shopping network business 
stanley net sales declined in as compared to with its hiring of a new president  stanley defined a new strategic direction  which emphasized new product development and improvement in recruitment of independent sales representatives  coupled with increased average order size 
these improvements  once instituted  were expected to slow rates of sales declines 
ctg net sales also declined in as compared to ctg s business in fiscal was impacted by lower distributor sales to school districts  due to state and local budget constraints 
to help offset the decline  ctg developed a strategy to diversify its customer mix by focusing on sales to national accounts  retail chains  and gsa scheduled business for government procurement 
these measures were also expected to mitigate and reverse sales declines in future periods 
in the imaging segment  net sales decreased for as compared to decreased  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange 
the shift from conventional film based to digital imaging continues to negatively impact sales of the company s medical and photographic chemistry and equipment 
in domestic markets  sales declines were in the range of to in fiscal versus fiscal although the company removed capacity in the us last year by consolidating manufacturing plants  the revenue shortfall has continued to depress profitability 
as the industry consolidates  the company is currently pursuing outsource manufacturing opportunities within its markets and believes it is in good position as a competitive supplier for north america 
in europe  both the shift to digital  coupled with the strengthening of the euro versus the dollar  impacted the company s operations in belgium and italy and the markets they serve 
both companies had significant reductions in sales and profitability in as compared to the european difficulties in were offset  however  with continued strong results at cpac asia and cpac africa see foreign operations discussions for international operations results 
the company s imaging segment believes that it is uniquely positioned to leverage its strategic  worldwide locations  product formulation capabilities  and market expertise to become a competitive  outsource private label imaging chemical supplier to major industry players  as they invest resources in digital technology 
this strategy  coupled with a plan for necessary reduction in future  fixed operating costs is anticipated to improve segment performance 
in the imaging segment  net sales decreased for as compared to decreased  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange 
most imaging operations  domestically and internationally  with the exception of cpac asia and cpac africa  had lower net sales in as compared to on a local currency basis 
this reflected the worldwide slowdown in the traditional imaging marketplace  due partly to the advances of digital products  fierce competition from larger entities  and currency pressures overseas  due to the stronger euro and japanese yen versus the us dollar 
domestically  the company s medical imaging and photo imaging had decreases in as compared to ranging from to 
the advances of digital technology will continue to impact both of these operations in future periods 
reduction in revenue was anticipated  spurring the imaging restructuring plan  which enabled the company to manufacture all domestic imaging products at one locati on see foreign operations discussion for international operation s annual results 
gross margins consolidated gross margins were for versus and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
gross margins in the fuller brands segment were   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
although the segment experienced raw material price increases for its chemical and petroleum based products in  these increases were offset by fluctuations in product mix 
the decline in gross margins in versus reflected the impact of lower production volume through the great bend  kansas  manufacturing facility  due to lower sales in each operation 
pricing for certain products are being reviewed for fiscal  in light of higher material costs in an effort to improve gross margins 
however  increasing manufacturing through put in the great bend facility is a key factor in maintaining and improving gross margins in future periods gross margins in the imaging segment were   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the decline in gross margins in versus reflected reductions in revenues occurring quicker than fixed cost reductions in the company s domestic manufacturing operations 
volume increases at cpac asia and cpac africa helped to mitigate the margin decline  as well as realization of manufacturing efficiencies in the segment s norcross  georgia  manufacturing facility late in the fiscal year 
despite this  the company believes that margins may continue to erode slightly  due to pricing pressures and declining domestic volumes 
the decline in versus reflected the continued pressures on pricing  due to the declining worldwide photographic and medical imaging markets  coupled with lower volumes of production 
selling  administrative and engineering expenses consolidated selling  administrative  and engineering costs in were of net sales  versus and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
for the fuller brands segment  selling  administrative  and engineering expenses for were of net sales  as compared to and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage in over is a function of certain non recurring selling and marketing expenses incurred in  prior to the company s entry into the retail marketplace 
as the company s business through the home shopping network and retail industry increases  the segment s selling  administrative  and engineering expenses may increase as a percentage of net sales  as these distribution channels have higher selling costs 
the increase in the percentage in versus reflects additional expense related to increased sales and marketing management  packaging revisions  and other initiatives related to fuller s expansion into the retail marketplace 
the increase also reflects the reduction in revenues in all operations 
during s fourth quarter  the segment undertook a comprehensive review of its fixed costs  which resulted in small reductions in personnel and other discretionary spending 
in the imaging segment  selling  administrative  and engineering costs for  exclusive of the imaging restructuring charges  were of net sales  as compared to and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in versus  as a percentage of net sales reflects revenue declines exceeding expense containment efforts in the segment s domestic and european operations 
this was offset somewhat by increased revenues with minimal increases in expenses at cpac asia and cpac africa 
the increase in versus is largely a result of revenues declining at a greater rate than expenses  especially in the segment s domestic operations 
while the imaging restructuring plan helped eliminate duplicate costs in the domestic imaging operations  the segment also continued to reduce fixed costs in light of falling revenues  including headcount and other discretionary spending during the fourth quarter of the company continued to seek fixed cost reductions in its european operations  which were impacted by increasing digital imaging competition  as well as adverse currency pressures 
research and development expenses research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales were approximately of net sales for  versus and of net sales for and  respectively 
the level of expense reflects the company s emphasis of focusing on improving existing products or developing complementary products  based on customer needs 
for  the fuller brands segment will need to continue developing new products to accelerate its entry into the retail marketplace and sustain its growing television shopping business  stimulate recruitment efforts in its direct selling business  as well as continuing to enhance ctg s commercial cleaning product offerings to compete in the highly competitive janitorial sanitation business 
in the imaging segment  continued effort will be placed on developing easy to use prepackaged  chemical formulations and innovative wrap around programs  involving chemistry  paper  and equipment for use in domestic and overseas imaging markets 
these efforts are not expected to increase research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  significantly from prior periods 
net interest expense net interest expense interest expense less interest income decreased in versus lower foreign debt levels in versus contributed to the decline 
net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased in versus while interest expense declined  due to lower debt levels  interest income declined even greater  due to lower levels of invested cash 
income taxes the company s consolidated income tax provision and resulting effective tax rate for were impacted significantly by the million valuation reserve that was recorded in the fourth quarter against the company s domestic net deferred tax assets 
a soft fourth quarter for the fuller brands segment  coupled with higher than expected fourth quarter operating losses in the domestic imaging segment  increased the company s year to date loss  where  under criteria specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes cumulative losses experienced over several years  the company is no longer able to assert that realization of its future tax benefits was more likely than not 
the income tax provision also reflects a tax benefit from the carry back of substantially all of the domestic net operating losses against previously remitted federal taxes 
in fiscal and beyond  any future domestic net operating losses would only be available to offset future taxable income 
in addition  the provision reflects the benefits of the cpac asia tax holiday in thailand computed to be approximately  or per diluted share  under a seven year tax holiday on manufacturing operation earnings  expiring in august  as well as the utilization of cpac africa s net operating loss carryforward to offset taxable income 
cpac europe and cpac italia s tax provisions in were not material 
the company s provision also recognized a tax liability based on the american jobs creation act of the act  which became law in the united states on october  included in the act was a provision that allowed for a one time tax dividends received deduction of of the foreign earnings remitted by foreign subsidiaries to us parent companies through december  the earnings available for remittance were those earnings previously designated as reinvested indefinitely 
the company evaluated the legislation and determined that certain previously unremitted earnings related only to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary  cpac asia imaging products limited  would be repatriated 
in march of  cpac asia declared a special dividend of  payable to cpac  inc a portion of its previously unremitted earnings and remitted the amount prior to march  in accordance with the act requirements  the use of these funds was described in a d omestic reinvestment plan approved by the company s senior management and board of directors 
the company has recorded the applicable  tax liability  after the one time dividends received deduction  in its tax provision 
at march   all other income of the company s foreign subsidiaries is considered to be permanently reinvested  and as such  deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the consolidated tax provision 
for  the company expects to maintain a valuation allowance on future tax benefits related to its domestic income  until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or it is able to develop additional tax planning strategies that would generate taxable income 
until then  the company s tax provision will include the net tax expense or benefit attributable to certain foreign operations and the expense or benefit from us operations will be recorded as an adjustment to the valuation allowance 
in the company recorded a net tax benefit of  or of the pretax loss 
the benefit was primarily attributable to domestic losses that were carried back to offset previous year s earnings  resulting in various state and us refundable taxes 
the net benefit was reduced somewhat by foreign tax expense  resulting from earnings at cpac europe  cpac italia  and cpac africa 
the company s asian subsidiary continued to enjoy the tax savings from its seven year tax holiday granted in thailand  which amounted to approximately  per diluted share 
the effective tax rate for income before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was in  as compared to in the continued reduction in the company s effective tax rate in resulted from a lower provision from its italian operation  who received certain tax credits and benefits related to its facility relocation  as well as the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards at its african operation 
similar to  the effective rate shows the benefits of the seven year tax holiday existing for the company s asian subsidiary  as well as lower state taxes due to reduced domestic earnings 
in conjunction with the sfas no 
goodwill adjustment recognized by the company in the first quarter of amounting to  a tax benefit of  was recorded 
this deferred asset in was expected to be realized over the next nine years  as the goodwill was deducted for income tax purposes 
at march  the company had recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately  with no valuation reserve 
these deferred tax assets consisted primarily of domestic us federal and state tax benefits for items which have been recognized for financial reporting purposes  but which will be reported on tax returns to be filed in the future and approximately  representing tax effected foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the domestic portion of the net deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the united states during future years 
despite domestic pretax losses for the year ended march   the company believed they were primarily attributable to the asset impairment and equity in losses from its investment in tura and the imaging restructuring plan and that the company would return to profitability in fiscal likewise  realization of the deferred tax asset related to the foreign net operating loss carryforward was also dependent on future  foreign income 
although realization for both was not assured  the company believed at march   in following the criteria specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  that it was more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
net loss the company s net loss for the year ended march  increased  as compared to the year ended march  the recognition of a valuation reserve against consolidated net deferred tax assets  an impairment adjustment related to a third party investment  and equity losses recognized on the company s investment in tura  coupled with revenue declines in versus in the imaging segment  all contributed to the increase in the company s net loss 
the company s income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended march  decreased  from the prior year 
the imaging restructuring expenses  the increasing losses of tura required to be recognized under the equity method of accounting  the impairment charge related to the company s investment in tura  and the reduced revenues in both segments contributed to the decline 
the net loss after the cumulative effect adjustment was  or a diluted share 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and recorded a one time  non cash expense of  net of a tax benefit of  or per diluted share 
the adjustment related to the fuller brands segment s cleaning technologies group investment in fiscal  whose goodwill was determined to be impaired  based on calculating the present value of future cash flows 
ctg had been impacted by several factors  including continued  reduced operating performance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations the results of operations for the company s foreign subsidiaries  including the impact of currency exchange  are reported on a three month lag 
intercompany sales between foreign operations have been eliminated in discussions of year over year fluctuations on a us dollar basis  as well as disclosures concerning amounts and percentages  with foreign currency impacts excluded 
combined net sales for the company s operations in thailand  south africa  belgium  and italy for fiscal as compared to decreased approximately  or or decreased approximately  or  excluding the impact of currency exchange 
for fiscal cpac europe and cpac italia net sales combined decreased decreased  after removing currency impact 
cpac asia s sales decreased less than decreased  after removing currency impact 
cpac africa continued to demonstrate growth  as net sales increased approximately  or  or  after removing currency impact

cpac asia s sales increased increased  after removing currency impact 
cpac africa s net sales increased approximately  or  or  after removing currency impact 
combined pretax profits for fiscal  prior to minority interests and equity in losses of tura  decreased approximately  approximately  excluding impact of currency exchange  as compared to fiscal cpac europe and cpac italia s pretax profits combined decreased approximately  approximately  excluding impact of currency exchange 
cpac africa s fiscal pretax income increased approximately  approximately  after removing currency impact  while cpac asia s profits were up approximately  approximately  after removing currency impact over fiscal combined pretax profits for fiscal  prior to minority interests and equity in losses of tura  increased approximately  approximately  excluding impact of currency exchange  as compared to fiscal cpac europe and cpac italia s pretax profits combined increased approximately approximately  excluding impact of currency exchange 
cpac africa s fiscal pretax income declined approximately  approximately  after removing currency impact  while cpac asia s profits were up approximately  approximately  after removing currency impact over fiscal over  of this increase resulted from the fiscal cpac asia bad debt provision increase  due to a troubled distributor account 
as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  the company accounts for its investment in tura under the equity method 
however  the company s recognition of the share of the losses of tura during the first six months of fiscal effectively reduced the basis of its investment to zero 
the company was not obligated to fund any losses or record its share of tura equity earnings or losses in future periods  unless tura became profitable 
over the last six months  tura attempted to restructure its operations by reducing its workforce  replacing its former president  and terminating financial management in an effort to reduce operating losses and improve cash flows 
however  tura was unsuccessful and is currently undergoing liquidation under german government supervision 
during  the company increased the investment in tura to requiring the change in accounting for this investment to the equity method 
commencing in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded its share of tura s net loss  plus the amortization of the purchase price in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded its of tura s net loss  plus the amortization of the purchase price 
tura s results reflected the worldwide economic pressures on the traditional film markets  as well as the stronger euro against the dollar 
in may the company met with the investee s primary lending institution to discuss the financial condition of tura  who was experiencing significant cash flow difficulties  due to continuing operating losses 
while tura was granted an extension until september  on the maturity date of its working capital line of credit  the ability for tura to meet its normal day to day operating expenses was conditional on obtaining future  capital infusions 
although the company had the option of increasing its ownership stake to by october  it declined to do so 
after recognition of approximately  and  of equity losses  including  and  of excess purchase price amortization for the years ended march  and  respectively  the company believed that the ability of tura to generate sufficient future cash flows was uncertain 
tura s financial statements showed current liabilities exceeding current assets  certain debt obligations having covenant violations  and operating losses continuing through tura s first quarter 
the company believed tura s current financial decline was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss of approximately  or 
cents per diluted share for the year ended march   reducing the estimated fair market value of the company s investment at march  to  the impairment adjustment reduced the previously allocated excess purchase price  leaving a value that the company believed was largely attributable to the supply contract s between the company and tura 
during fiscal  this value was written down to zero 
the company has exposure to currency fluctuations and occasionally has utilized hedging programs primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts to help minimize the impact of these fluctuations on results of operations 
at march  no forward foreign currency exchange contracts were outstanding 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange losses are included in income or expense as incurred and are not material to the results of operations 
imaging restructuring during fiscal  the company completed the shift of its domestic manufacturing of photochemicals from its st 
louis  missouri  facility to its cpac imaging america s manufacturing facility in norcross  georgia 
the transfer of the manufacturing fixed assets  as well as the retrofitting of the georgia facility to absorb this production  was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this endeavor  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and accounted for the employee termination costs and other costs associated with the move under its guidelines 
the total expenses incurred in this project were approximately  as of september   all termination benefit costs and other move related costs accrued at march  were fully paid 
the table below summarizes the total costs accrued and paid under the criteria described in sfas no 
severance pay and benefits reserve unaudited other associated costs reserve total first quarter fiscal charges first quarter fiscal paid june  balance second quarter fiscal charges second quarter fiscal paid september  balance third quarter fiscal charges third quarter fiscal paid december  balance fourth quarter fiscal charges fourth quarter fiscal paid march  balance first quarter fiscal charges first quarter fiscal paid june  balance second quarter fiscal charges second quarter fiscal paid september  balance the company completed the sale of the st 
louis facility on september  and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concluded that it would not utilize  nor was able to sublease its  square feet of warehouse space in st 
louis  missouri  which it was renting under a ten year lease obligation with an option to terminate as of january   with month s notification 
the company then entered into negotiations with its landlord  resulting in a termination of lease agreement that will allow the company to pay a settlement amount of  to terminate the lease as of june   resulting in a savings to the company of  the lease termination fee has been accrued at march   with the expense recorded in cost of sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and acquisitions with internally generated cash flows  supplemented with outside borrowings 
the following table summarizes cpac  inc s consolidated cash flow information in thousands for the years ended march  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities currency impact on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities consolidated net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to  largely due to planned inventory increases in the fuller brands segment to support the home shopping and retail business  offset somewhat by increases and decreases in other operating assets and liabilities in the last quarter of the fiscal year 
consolidated net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to  due to reduced operating profits in both segments 
net cash provided by used in investing activities consolidated net cash used in investing activities decreased in versus  due to cash received in from the sale of the company s st 
louis  missouri  manufacturing facility  coupled with lower capital additions and lower business investments 
the company did invest  in acquiring the minority ownership share in cpac asia imaging products limited in september consolidated net cash used in investing activities increased in versus  due to the company s additional  equity investment in tura in april  as well as capital expenditures related to cpac imaging s expansion of their norcross manufacturing facility to absorb the relocated color photochemicals production from st 
louis 
net cash provided by used in financing activities consolidated cash used in financing activities decreased in versus  due to lower debt payments made 
in cpac asia repaid its various term debt obligations early and remained debt free in consolidated net cash used in financing activities decreased in over  due to decreased repurchases of the company s common stock  offset by increased debt repayments 
in fiscal  cpac asia s strong cash flows allowed it to repay its outstanding term debt early 
working capital and leverage ratios working capital is the excess of current assets over current liabilities 
the working capital ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities 
the ratio of long term debt to shareholders equity is calculated by dividing long term borrowings current and long term portions by shareholders equity 
for the years ended march  working capital in thousands working capital ratio to to to long term debt to shareholders equity to to to during working capital increased  as described above  largely due to the sale of the st 
louis manufacturing facility  decreased capital expenditures  and decreased expenditures on business investments 
the long term debt to shareholders equity ratio increased slightly  due to an increased net loss experienced in  coupled with slightly higher borrowings 
during the company s working capital declined  as described above  due to increased investment in tura  increased capital expenditures related to the imaging restructuring project  and reduction in cpac asia s long term  term note obligations 
the long term debt to shareholders equity ratio improved slightly  due to larger than normal reductions in foreign subsidiary debt 
in the company continued to build working capital  despite lower sales and profits  due to tight cash controls  aggressive receivable collections  implementation of inventory reduction goals within the fuller brands segment  and reduction in working capital borrowings at cpac asia  as a result of continued strong cash flow 
on june   the company amended its line of credit agreement agreement with bank of america  na boa  extending its maturity date to october  the agreement includes a maximum borrowing capability of  with interest at the day libor rate plus to based on funded debt to ebitda parameters 
the company also renewed its million letter of credit facility  which collateralizes the fuller brands industrial revenue bonds to october  at march   the company had not accessed its line of credit 
the amended agreement requires the company to meet various quarterly and annual debt covenants  including minimum deposit liquidity  minimum net worth  debt service coverage  funded debt to ebitda  as well as limitations on capital expenditures  and amounts spent on acquisitions 
at march   the company was in compliance with its various loan covenants or received appropriate waivers 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited has a line of credit with an international bank of million baht approximately  based on the year end conversion rate in thailand 
interest is payable at the bank s announced prime rate in thailand  which was at march  cpac asia had borrowings against the line of credit of and  at march  and  respectively 
management believes that its existing available lines of credit and cash flows from operations should be adequate to meet normal working capital needs  based on operations as of march  additional financing may be necessary to allow the company to pursue further acquisitions 
asset turnover ratios for the years ended march  receivables days outstanding days days days annual inventory turns times times times receivable days outstanding at march   as compared to march  and  continued to show slight improvement  largely as a result of reduced days outstanding in the fuller brands segment s accounts receivable 
improved credit and collection efforts with current and historically past due customers contributed to the improvement 
inventory turns continued their slight decrease in versus and  partly due to planned increases at fuller brands to support their home shopping network and retail customer business  as well as decreased turns in the domestic imaging segment  due to a more rapid decline in sales than planned 
while fuller brands inventory levels will be conditional on the levels of business with the aforementioned distribution channels  efforts will be made to reduce imaging s levels to more closely react to rapidly changing markets  which continued to be impacted by digital imaging 
contractual cash obligations amounts in thousands the following table summarizes information about the company s consolidated contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands  as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its consolidated liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year to years to years after years unused credit facilities standby letters of credit total commercial commitments as of march   the company had no borrowings against its million line of credit with its primary domestic lending institution 
as of march   the company s wholly owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited had no borrowings against its  line of credit  with its primary lending institution 
the company believes that these obligations have no material impact on cpac  inc s liquidity and capital resources 
as of the date of the report  cpac  inc had no other commercial commitments  which may impact its capital resources and liquidity 
in the absence of unforeseen developments  cpac  inc believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating expenses and other operational requirements at least for the months following the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
cpac  inc believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue  and expense amounts 
revenue recognition the company s revenues result primarily from sales of chemical based products or complementary hard goods in each of its segments 
for revenue recognition purposes  the company reviews all sales transactions to ensure the following attributes are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of ownership transfer  sales price fixed and determinable  and collectibility reasonably assured 
in the fuller brands segment  the product offerings consist of sales of cleaning and personal care chemical based products both consumer and industrial as well as related stick good products ie  brushes  brooms  mops 
although sales are generated through various distribution channels  such as independent distributors  company employed sales associates  direct selling independent representatives  retail outlet stores  catalog  internet  direct marketing partners  and direct to end users  the revenue recognition policies remain virtually the same in each operation or channel 
shipping of these products is primarily by land using independent freight carriers 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated costs of product returns and reduces revenue for estimated returns 
in the consolidated statement of operations  the company presents sales at net  adjusting for sales discounts  returns  allowances  and volume rebates  which are not deemed signific ant 
in the imaging segment  revenue results primarily from sales of chemicals used in the photofinishing  medical imaging  or graphic arts arenas 
imaging s distribution channels  both domestic and international  are primarily through independent distributors  or direct to end users  with limited company employed sales associates 
revenue recognition practices are similar in all venues 
domestically  most products are shipped via land carriers 
in situations where legal contracts have stipulated the time at which title transfer has occurred fob destination versus traditional fob shipping  revenue is recognized according to contract terms 
internationally  chemical products are shipped via truck and sea 
again  special emphasis is placed on reviewing contractual terms to ensure the point at which title and risk of ownership has transferred and that the other revenue recognition attributes criteria are present 
appropriate accruals for discounts and volume rebates  which exist f or sales into the medical imaging market  are recorded at time of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly reviews its customer accounts and records specific provisions for doubtful accounts to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is estimated to be collectible 
the company also records provisions for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  current economic conditions  and other adverse industry or market trends 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
the company recorded an expense provision of   and  to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the provision added in versus was primarily related to the imaging segm ent  whose customers and markets reflect the softness of the traditional photographic market  due to the impact of digital imaging 
while the segment continues to seek out new opportunities  there are inherent risks in many of these markets latin america  south america  eastern europe  as well as increasing pressures on many of the segment s existing us distributors  which may continue to impact the collectibility of certain receivables in future periods 
the increase in s expense provision  as previously disclosed  was primarily due to cpac asia and cpac europe s troubled distributor receivables in japan and russia 
inventory reserves the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as part of this valuation  reserve provisions are made to reduce inventory carrying values based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving  or obsolete  or for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these provisions are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions  and related management initiatives 
if in the future  the company determines that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected and  therefore  inventory is overvalued  the company will be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record an expense at the time the determination is made 
the company recorded an expense provision of   and  for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  respectively 
in  both segments disposed of much of the inventory identified in previous years as unsalable or obsolete 
fuller brands continues to review their inventory  in light of product mix changes for the products being sold through home shopping network and retail distribution channels  and provide for products whose sales appear to be declining 
the imaging segment continues to try and match current production levels with forecasted sales demand  to avoid an unnecessary buildup in inventory  which could potentially increase the reserve due to excess stock 
the increase in over previous year s expense reflected additional reserve provisions in the fuller brands segment for products experiencing net realizability issues  as well as the phase out of certain product lines sold in the segment s direct selling business 
in addition  the company s imaging operations increased their reserves related to aging chemical and packaging inventory no longer salable 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable  or in the case of goodwill  at least annually
