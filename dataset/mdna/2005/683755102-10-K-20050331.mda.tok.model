we completed our initial public offering in october between and  as part of our strategy to expand internationally  we established our presence in the united kingdom  asia and mexico through various acquisitions 
in january  we acquired orc protel  a telemarketing company based in lansing  illinois 
in may  we acquired orc macro  a research  consulting and technology company based in the washington  dc area 
the acquisition of orc macro substantially increased our presence in the public sector 
in august  we acquired c j research  inc  and in october  we acquired shs 
the two acquisitions in allowed us to expand our service offerings into the areas of consumer research and communications services and to further expand in the area of information management 
we currently have four segments for financial reporting purposes social research  uk market research  us market research  and teleservices 
while our consolidated revenues grew from to  our performance has varied from segment to segment 
we have achieved strong performance in our social research segment  which has benefited from the us federal government s increased spending on health related research and our success in winning new projects and renewing existing projects 
during this period  our us market research segment experienced a decline in revenues due to weak economic conditions in the us our us market research segment experienced stable revenues due to the strength of the global research market 
the teleservices segment experienced a decline in revenues due to weak economic conditions in the us as well as factors unique to the telemarketing industry  such as the enactment of new laws regulating the industry and competition from call centers outside of the us 
table of contents our operating income grew from to  reflecting the strong performance in our social research segment 
the loss of revenues over the past three years in the us market research and teleservices segments led to the write off of goodwill in these segments and our korean subsidiary  which reduced operating income by million in and million in operating income increased to million in from a loss of million in the operating loss in included a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we believe that the decline in revenues in the us market research segment was due to the slow economy and resulting reductions in our clients discretionary market research budgets 
this situation has improved recently  with revenues in increasing to million from million in backlog for this segment has increased from million at december  to million at december  we believe that revenues attributable to this segment will increase if the economy continues to improve  and  because we maintained our fixed cost structure of research professionals through the slow years  we expect that operating income as a percentage of revenues in this segment will improve as our revenues increase 
the decrease in operating income levels from to led to difficulty in complying with our loan agreement covenants and the resulting incurrence of amendment fees 
as a result of a default under our senior credit facility in  we incurred forbearance fees and refinancing fees 
in we refinanced all of our debt to extend our debt maturities  reduce our borrowing costs  and relax certain financial covenants 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities below 
the following are important factors that affect our results of operations revenues we generate our revenues from the hourly billings of professional labor  including part time labor  from call center services  and from charging our clients for the out of pocket costs and subcontracted services incurred for projects 
in our market research and social research segments  revenues under fixed price contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis 
revenues under time and materials contracts and cost reimbursement contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
for the teleservices segment we recognize revenues at the time the services are performed 
the level of our revenues is affected by government spending patterns  general economic conditions  the competitiveness of our service offerings in the marketplace and general market conditions that influence the demand for our specific services and pricing 
cost of revenues all costs directly attributable to a project are included in cost of revenues 
these include the salary  benefits and incentive compensation expense for our professional staff and the hourly wages and benefits of our part time staff engaged in project work 
the cost of our professional staff is relatively fixed over the short term  and fluctuations in our gross margin may occur due to changes in project margins  the mix of project work that we perform  the level of part time labor and other variable costs and the utilization rates of our staff 
in addition  we include project related telephone expense and out of pocket expenses  including travel  and subcontracted services incurred for project work  in cost of revenues  and the level of these expenditures impacts our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses these include expenses that are not directly related to project performance  including salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for executive management and support services including marketing  information technology  finance and human resources 
also included are external expenses including insurance  legal  marketing and audit  office space and support service expenses  travel and training costs  directors fees and other non project related expenses

upon completion of the assessments  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in teleservices and million in us market research 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and other intangibles  for additional information

we cannot provide assurance that an additional impairment charge will not be required in the future if the us market research and teleservices businesses do not recover as projected 
interest and other non operating expenses  net interest and other non operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was principally due to a million charge for debt fees  principally the non cash write off of unamortized loan fees  related to debt that was refinanced during the second quarter of provision benefit for income taxes the benefit provision for income taxes for was million and million for excluding the effect of tax benefits of million resulting from the goodwill impairment charges in  the provisions for these years are higher than the amounts that result from applying the federal statutory rate to income before income taxes  due to our not recognizing tax benefits for certain state and non us losses as well as increased state taxes from profitable business segments

these warrants were issued in to allied and are for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the extension of these warrants is valued at  and will be accreted through interest expense over the life of the unsecured subordinated notes

in addition  covenants under our credit facilities limit or prohibit our ability to incur additional debt  prepay specified types of indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  or engage in mergers and acquisitions 
in conjunction with our may refinancing we incurred additional costs of approximately million which are included in other long term assets in our consolidated financial statements and are being amortized over the remaining terms of the facilities  commencing in the second quarter of  and we wrote off the unamortized loan fees of approximately million as interest expense  which included cash payments of  made in during the third quarter of  it came to our attention and the attention of our lenders that we had inadvertently failed to make a payment in the amount of million under a provision of our then existing senior credit facility that required us to make payments out of excess cash flow 
pursuant to a forbearance agreement we entered into with our senior lenders  the senior lenders allowed us to make the million payment in four equal monthly installments beginning december   and we agreed that we would refinance the credit facility with new lenders by december  we were not able to refinance the senior credit facility by december  as a result of the foregoing  our senior lenders did not approve interest payments in the amount of  that we were required to make to our subordinated lenders 
all defaults were cured with our entry into an amended senior credit facility with our then senior lender on december   and requirements concerning future payments out of excess cash flow were waived

recent developments we have proposed to effect a public offering of our common stock and have filed a registration statement on form s and amendments thereto with the sec regarding the public offering 
we contemplate that we will use the proceeds of the offering to repurchase the llr interests from the llr partnerships for an aggregate cash purchase price of million and to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under the senior revolving facility 
if the public offering is consummated and we repurchase the llr interests  we will incur a deduction to net income  before calculating net income available to common shares  equal to the difference between the value received by the llr partnerships for the llr interests and our carrying value of the llr interests

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the estimates will change under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the implementation of the following critical accounting policies  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  introduces the most significant levels of judgments and estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition service revenue is recognized when earned  generally as work is performed in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
services performed vary from contract to contract and are not uniformly performed over the term of the arrangement 
in our market research and social research segments  revenues under fixed price contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis 
performance is based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs where the costs incurred represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures of contract performance  including survey design  data collection  survey analysis and presentation of deliverables to the client 
progress on a contract is matched against project costs and costs to complete on a periodic basis 
provision for estimated contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
customers are obligated to pay as services are performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
revenues under cost reimbursement contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
applicable estimated profits are included in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
incentives  award fees or penalties related to performance are also considered in estimating revenues and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
see item  business government contracts for a discussion of the types of contracts we have with the us federal government 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
in our teleservices segment  revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other identifiable intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors  such as trading and transaction multiples  and for other identifiable assets  valuation estimates for items such as backlog and outstanding proposals  to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
on january   we adopted statement no 
 which requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
at the date of adoption  we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets with an unamortized balance of  to goodwill and recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  goodwill impairment related to our mexican subsidiary of  or per share 
during we identified other intangible assets with useful lives that could no longer be determined 
as a result  we reclassified  from other intangible assets to goodwill in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in us market research 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded non cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of goodwill in the amount of million in teleservices  million in us market research and  in our korean subsidiary 

table of contents the significant assumptions used in determining the market value of the teleservices business were as follows times trailing twelve month revenues for comparable publicly traded companies  times trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for comparable publicly traded companies  times trailing twelve month revenues for comparable sales transactions  multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for comparable sales transactions were not included given the absence of profitable comparable companies  for a five year financial projection  a discount rate of  an exit multiple of times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a compound growth rate for revenues of and an improvement in operating income as a percentage of revenues from to  and in the overall evaluation  the publicly traded comparable data was discounted to reflect the netting of discounts for marketability  company size and customer concentration and a control premium 
the significant assumptions used in determining the market value of the us market research business were as follows times trailing twelve month revenues for comparable publicly traded companies  times trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for comparable publicly traded companies  times trailing twelve month revenues for comparable sales transactions  times trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for comparable sales transactions  for a five year financial projection  a discount rate of  an exit multiple of times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a compound growth rate for revenues of and no improvement in operating income as a percentage of revenues  and in the overall evaluation  the publicly traded comparable data was discounted to reflect the netting of discounts for marketability and company size and a control premium 
the valuation metric assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analyses performed on our teleservices and us market research segments differed significantly for two principal reasons 
first  because these two segments were and continue to be engaged in very different types of business  they were and must continue to be compared to very different types of companies and transactions 
in performing this analysis of market comparables  we determined that both the public trading comparables and the relevant sale transaction comparables were very different for these two segments at the time of comparison 
second  
table of contents because the two segments had very different types of operating risks at the time  we used different weighted average costs of capital and different discount rates for lack of marketability in these analyses 
one of the most significant differences in operating risks between these two segments was the nature and mix of the client contracts when viewed in the context of the then current market conditions 
both of these factors led to the use of lower valuation metric assumptions for the teleservices segment at the time we performed the analyses 
deferred tax and valuation allowance deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered to be more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
at december  we had net deferred tax assets of million before the application of a valuation allowance 
of this amount  million is made up of state deferred tax assets of subsidiaries that have not been profitable 
we recognize that it is not more likely than not that the future tax benefits of these assets will be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a million valuation allowance against these assets 
we believe that all of the deferred tax assets for federal and non us income tax purposes will be fully realized 
in order to fully realize these tax assets  we must have pre tax earnings in the us of million and pre tax earnings outside the us of  recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  statement no 
 which requires liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when the liabilities are incurred  rather than when an entity commits to an exit plan 
statement no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
this rule changed the timing of liability and expense recognition related to exit or disposal activities  but not the ultimate amount of such expenses 
in  we reduced our workforce in the us market research operating segment and  as a result  incurred one time termination benefits of approximately  for the termination of certain employees 
these termination benefits were recognized in accordance with statement no 
and included in our results of operations for the year ended december  during  we paid out all previously accrued termination benefits from in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
interpretation no 

interpretation no 
requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r interpretation no 
r  which clarified and amended interpretation no 
interpretation no 
r requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse 
table of contents risk among the parties involved 
interpretation no 
r also enhances the disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and  with respect to variable interest entities created before february   interpretation no 
r applied for the quarter ended march  during  we formed the joint venture with ratrix analytics llc for the purpose of developing new research based products 
as of december   we had a ownership interest and voting interest in the joint venture 
in  we contributed in services and cash and  since inception  have contributed an aggregate of million 
all amounts funded to date have been expensed 
we are not obligated for future funding of the joint venture 
as the joint venture has a sufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected loss  the equity owners as a group are able to make decisions about the entity s activities  and the equity owners have the obligation to absorb expected losses and the rights to receive the expected residual returns  we believe that the joint venture is not a variable interest entity under the principal criteria as set forth in interpretations no 
and r and  accordingly  we are not required to apply the consolidation provision under interpretations no

statement no 
r supersedes opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and its related interpretations  and eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting  which we currently use 
statement no 
r allows for two alternative transition methods

the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under statement no

r is adopted 
in december  the fasb issued fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act was signed into law on october  the act provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined by the act in either an enterprise s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment 
at december   unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that could qualify for this special one time tax deduction of were approximately  because at this time it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings  no us taxes have been provided 
if  upon further evaluation of this provision  we conclude that we will repatriate these unremitted foreign earnings  the tax expense recognized would be approximately  inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date  nor do we expect it to have a significant impact through foreign currency exchange fluctuations did not have a material impact on our operating results from to as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
it has not been our practice to enter into foreign exchange contracts  but such contracts may be used in the future if we deem them to be an appropriate resource to manage our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents risk factors readers of this report should be aware that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual operating results and could cause our actual consolidated results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of us 
risks related to our business general economic and industry specific factors beyond our control may adversely affect our business by causing demand for our services to decline 
a number of factors beyond our control could decrease the demand of our existing clients for our services and impair our ability to attract new clients 
these include marketing budgets  general economic conditions  business consolidations  government spending  and other industry specific trends 
changes in management or ownership of an existing client are also factors that could affect the client s demand for our services 
as a result  we may provide different levels of services to our clients from year to year  and these differences can cause a decline in or contribute to fluctuations in our operating results 
our business could suffer if we were to lose the business of samhsa  usaid or one or more of our other large clients 
samhsa and usaid are our largest clients 
samhsa represented of our revenues and of our backlog at december  usaid  our second largest client  represented of our revenues and of our backlog at december  services we provided to various us federal and state governmental departments and agencies  including samhsa and usaid  generated approximately of our revenues in our clients generally may terminate the services we provide to them at any time 
if we lose one or more of our large clients  such as samhsa or usaid  or if one or more of our large clients reduces its business with us  our revenues could decline 
we have incurred losses in recent years and may not be profitable in the future 
these losses may adversely affect our business and the market price of our stock 
we incurred net losses of million in and million in we may not be able to attain or increase profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis 
any future losses may adversely affect our business and the market price of our stock 
covenants in our loan agreements could adversely affect our business by limiting our operational and financial flexibility 
our present credit agreements contain customary financial and operating covenants 
these covenants limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  prepay specified types of indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  or engage in mergers and acquisitions 
these covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our operational and financial flexibility 

table of contents we may enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of possible acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition we make in the future will provide us with the benefits we anticipated in entering into the transaction 
acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  potential disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management  impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel  inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired business  difficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our services  unexpected expenses resulting from the acquisition  potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses  and unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  restructuring charges and large one time write offs  such as write offs for acquired in process research and development costs 
acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
furthermore  if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities  the holdings of our existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decline 
fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results may cause unanticipated decreases in available cash and may cause the value of our stock to decline 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results 
these fluctuations may make financial planning and forecasting more difficult 
in addition  these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash  which could negatively impact our operations 
these fluctuations also could increase the volatility of our stock price 

table of contents a number of factors cause our revenues  cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter  including fluctuations in revenues earned and expenses incurred on fixed price contracts and contracts with a performance based fee structure  commencement  completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter  variable purchasing patterns under government and commercial contracts  and changes in policy or budgetary measures that adversely affect government and commercial contracts in general 
changes in the number of contracts commenced  completed or terminated during any quarter may cause significant variations in our revenues and  because a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed  in our operating results 
in addition  payments due to us from government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of delayed approvals of governmental budgets by legislative  executive or other governmental bodies 
our operating results may suffer if there are additional significant goodwill write offs 
goodwill related to acquisitions represents a substantial portion of our total assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote off impaired goodwill in the aggregate amount of million 
at december   the net goodwill amount on our consolidated balance sheet represented of our total assets 
goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair market value of the net assets of those businesses 
if the fair value of the goodwill  determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards  falls below the recorded value shown on the balance sheet  we will be required to write off the excess goodwill 
any future write off would be treated as an expense and  although non cash in nature  would adversely affect our operating results by reducing net income 
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the personnel required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
we are a service business  and as such we are dependent upon the efforts and skills of our senior executives and other key employees 
the cumulative effect of losing several of these individuals could hurt our business 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executives other than john f 
short  our chief executive officer 
competition for senior management is intense  and in the future we may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting and retaining other personnel that we may require 
our clients spending priorities may change in a manner which could negatively affect our revenues 
a majority of our revenues result from services we provide to the us federal government  therefore  our business depends upon continued us federal government expenditures 
a significant decline in government expenditures  or a shift of expenditures away from programs for which we provide services  could adversely affect our business 
in addition  it has been our experience that our commercial 
table of contents clients generally view their expenditures for our services as discretionary 
if our commercial clients budgets for discretionary spending on programs for which we provide services decrease or if their priorities for spending shift in a manner that results in a significant decline in research expenditures  our business could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues 
our contracts with the us federal government grant the government rights that are typically not found in commercial contracts and that could adversely affect our revenues and income 
we presently have approximately active contracts and task orders with the us federal government which represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  there are inherent risks in contracting with the us federal government which could have an adverse effect on our business 
all contracts with the us federal government contain provisions  and or are subject to laws and regulations  that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in our commercial contracts  including rights that allow the government to claim rights in and ownership of products and systems that we produce  adjust contract costs and fees on the basis of audits completed by its agencies  suspend or debar us from doing business with the us federal government  and release information obtained from us in response to a freedom of information act request 
the us federal government has the right to terminate its contracts with us at any time and such terminations could adversely affect our revenues and income 
the us federal government has the right to terminate its contracts with us at any time 
if the us federal government terminates a contract  we may recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on work completed before the termination 
if the government terminates a contract for default  we may not recover even those amounts  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
additionally  most of our backlog could be reduced by any modification or termination of contracts that we have with the us federal government or  in cases where we are a subcontractor  contracts that our prime contractors have with the us federal government 
as a contractor to the us federal government  we are subject to restrictions and compliance requirements that could divert the attention of our management  drain our resources and or result in additional costs  fines or other penalties 
as a contractor to the us federal government  we are subject to various laws and regulations that are more restrictive than those applicable to non government contractors 
we are required to obtain and maintain material governmental authorizations and approvals to conduct our business as it is currently conducted 
new or more stringent laws or governmental regulations concerning government contracts could hurt our business by limiting our flexibility and by potentially causing us to incur additional expenses 
we also must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of us federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect 
table of contents how we do business with our us federal government clients and may result in added costs for our business 
for example  we are required to comply with the federal acquisition regulations and all supplements  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of us federal government contracts  and the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with us federal government agencies 
any of the sanctions could adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  or operating results 
we may not receive the full amount authorized under contracts that we have entered into and our backlog may be lower than we have projected  both of which could reduce our future revenues 
we define backlog as the total contract value of our engagements that our management believes to be firm  less previously recognized revenues 
our backlog includes the amounts of our commercial contracts  the funded and unfunded amounts of our government contracts  and options to renew or extend government contracts that we expect our clients to exercise 
however  the maximum contract value specified under each contract that we enter into is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract 
because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract  our estimates of our backlog may not prove to be accurate since the actual recognition of revenues on programs included in backlog may never occur or may change 
estimates of future revenues included in backlog are not necessarily precise and the receipt and timing of any of the revenues are subject to contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
for a discussion of these contingencies  see special note regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
our competitors could challenge successfully the award of a government contract to us  causing us to lose the contract  which could reduce our future revenues 
a unique feature of us federal government contracting allows a contractor that loses a prime contract award to protest the contract award to its competitor and obtain an independent review of the agency s decision making process 
a contractor may also protest the terms of a bid solicitation if it believes those terms to be unfair or anticompetitive 
if one or more of our competitors challenges a contract awarded to us  the government may ultimately determine that it is necessary for the contract to undergo a new round of evaluation and competition  and our contract with the government may be terminated 
a successful challenge by a competitor could cause us to lose a contract that might otherwise be awarded to us and reduce our future revenues 

table of contents our government contracts are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the us federal government  which could hurt our operating results 
the us federal government audits and reviews our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
responding to governmental audits  inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert the attention of our management 
an audit of our work  including an audit of work performed by companies we have acquired or may acquire  could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues because any costs determined by the government to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and revenues we have already recognized may need to be refunded 
if a us federal government audit results in allegations of improper or illegal activities by us or our employees and if we are unable to successfully defend against those allegations  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension  or debarment from doing business with us federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us regardless of the merits of any such allegation 
in addition  the us federal government may conduct non audit reviews on a majority of our government contracts  which in turn could lead to full audit reviews by the government 
we may not accurately estimate the expenses  time and resources necessary to satisfy our contractual obligations  which could hurt our operating results 
we enter into three types of contracts with our clients fixed price  cost reimbursement and time and materials 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our consolidated revenues from fixed price contracts  of our consolidated revenues from cost reimbursement contracts and of our consolidated revenues from time and materials contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we provide specified services for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursement contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities  but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns 
our profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for or negotiating the contract 
under cost reimbursement contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
to the extent that the actual costs incurred in performing a cost reimbursement contract are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract and applicable regulations  we are entitled to reimbursement of our costs  plus a profit 
however  if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or  in the case of government contracts  by applicable regulations  our income may be adversely affected because we may not be able to recover those costs 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for expenses 
we assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates 
if our employees engage in misconduct or other improper activities  we could be subject to various penalties and liabilities 
we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur and would expose us  as well as the individual employee  to various penalties and liabilities  including those under the federal false claims act 
misconduct by employees could include intentional or unintentional failures to comply with us federal government procurement regulations or failure to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to us 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and 
table of contents the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity including our policies and procedures may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses 
our competitors could obtain  and use to our detriment  confidential information about us obtained through a request under the freedom of information act 
our competitors may be able to obtain confidential information about us  such as our cost or pricing policies  in a request under the freedom of information act 
the competitor could use this information as the basis for a successful challenge to the award of a contract to us or to gain a competitive business advantage that it might use to our detriment in future bid solicitations 
our international operations subject us to social  political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were generated from contracts performed outside of the us  and a portion of those revenues was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that the results of our foreign operations may decline in value as measured in us dollars 
it has not been our practice to enter into foreign exchange contracts to protect against adverse foreign currency fluctuations  and we cannot predict whether future exchange rate fluctuations will significantly harm our operations or financial results 
in addition to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we are exposed to further risks inherent in doing business abroad  including limitations on asset transfers  changes in foreign regulations and political turmoil  all of which could adversely affect our operating results 
several of our purported stockholders have filed a lawsuit against us  which could result in significant legal costs and divert management attention from the operation of our business 
on december   several of our purported stockholders filed a derivative complaint against us and our directors in the chancery court of the state of delaware alleging  among other things  that our directors breached their fiduciary duties of good faith and loyalty to us and our stockholders 
the lawsuit seeks injunctive relief  rescissory damages and costs related to the suit 
we could incur significant costs defending the lawsuit  and management attention could be diverted from other important business concerns 
an adverse determination in the lawsuit may harm our business 
for more information about this lawsuit  see item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k 
risks related to our industry the marketing research industry is vulnerable to general economic conditions  which may cause our revenues to decline 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their marketing research expenditures as discretionary 
if general economic conditions worsen and these companies seek to control variable costs  research projects for which we have been engaged to collect data may be delayed or cancelled  and new project bookings may decrease 
as a result  our revenues may decline 

table of contents our industry is competitive  and larger  better financed competitors may be more successful in obtaining clients than we are 
we face competition in connection with most of the services we provide 
other companies  including some with greater financial resources than we have  may offer a range of services similar to those offered by us  or may otherwise compete more effectively in the research and information services industry 
we regularly experience significant competition for clients seeking research services from a large number of our competitors 
these competitors include market research companies  advertising agencies  and business consulting firms 
we compete for research clients with a large number of firms that vary in size as well as with not for profit organizations 
for telemarketing services clients  we compete with a large number of telemarketing companies 
our business may suffer if state and us federal government do not call list regulations are made applicable to market research phone calls 
our business may be restricted by the development of various us federal and state do not call lists and other privacy regulations that permit consumers to protect themselves from unsolicited telemarketing telephone calls 
in  the federal trade commission amended its rules to establish a national do not call registry 
generally  vendors are prohibited from calling anyone on that registry unless the consumer has initiated the contact  has given prior consent or has an ongoing business relationship with the vendor for whom the calls have been made 
although do not call list regulations do not currently apply to market research phone calls  new legislation or regulation could eliminate the current market research exemption 
if do not call list regulations become applicable to market research phone calls  our results of operations may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues 
special note regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements 
in general  statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report  including statements regarding revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses  profitability  financial position  business strategy  and plans and objectives of management for future operations  are forward looking statements 
the words believe  may  will  estimate  continue  anticipate  intend  expect and similar expressions  as they relate to us  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition  results of operations  business strategy  and financial needs 
these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks  uncertainties and assumptions described under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this report  including  among other things fluctuations in demand for our services  competition  our dependence on key personnel  government funding of social research projects  leverage and debt service including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates  
table of contents domestic and global economic  credit and capital market conditions  foreign exchange fluctuations  changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of these laws  regulatory or judicial proceedings  the outcome of the stockholders derivative litigation  and certain other risks described in this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
this list of risks is not exhaustive 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information  future events or developments  except as required by federal securities laws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
we monitor interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposures on an ongoing basis 
we have in the past entered into interest rate hedging contracts and will continue to evaluate their appropriateness 
as of december   we were not a party to any interest rate hedging contract 
it has not been our practice to enter into foreign exchange contracts  but we may use such contracts in the future if we deem them to be an appropriate resource to manage our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not consider our current foreign exchange exposure  which is primarily related to changes between the us dollar and the us pound  to be material 
although the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates may be significant on our revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses when considered individually  the net impact on our results of operations has not been significant
