item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of operations together with our present financial conditions 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see forward looking statements and other information at the beginning of this annual report and risk factors affecting our business beginning on page for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview of our business we are an independent natural gas and oil producer concentrating on growing reserves and production through the exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves in north america 
our core areas of operations are south texas  offshore in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico and the arkoma basin of oklahoma and arkansas 
during  we initiated operations in the rocky mountain region  with an initial focus in the uinta basin of northeastern utah  and during  we expanded our focus to include the dj basin of eastern colorado 
in february  we divested our south louisiana assets and in june  we divested our appalachian basin assets in connection 
table of contents with the keyspan exchange transaction described in note stockholders equity keyspan exchange and offering of item contained in this form k 
we operate as one segment as each of our operating areas has similar economic characteristics and each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
at december   net proved reserves were billion cubic feet equivalent or bcfe  with a present value of future net cash flows before income taxes  discounted at per annum  of billion and standardized measure of future net cash flows including income taxes  discounted at per annum  of billion 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
approximately of our proved reserves at december   were natural gas  approximately of which were classified as proved developed 
as of december   we operated approximately of our producing wells 
daily production averaged million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent or mmcfe in we were founded in december as a delaware corporation and began exploring for natural gas and oil on behalf of keyspan corporation 
keyspan  a member of the standard poor s index  is a diversified energy provider whose principal natural gas distribution and electric generation operations are located in the northeastern united states 
in september we completed our initial public offering and sold approximately of our shares to the public 
through three separate transactions  the first in february and the last in november  keyspan completely divested of its investment in the common stock of our company 
as of december   keyspan no longer owned any common stock of our company 
see note stockholders equity and note related party transactions for a complete description of these three transactions 
source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our natural gas and oil properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale 
the price of natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we utilize derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas production 
during and  the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods 
principal components of our cost structure lease operating expenses 
the day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
these costs include lease operating expense  severance tax and transportation expense  which costs are expected to increase 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition  exploration and development efforts  including interest and certain general and administrative costs  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
generally  if reserve quantities are revised up or down  the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate per unit of production will change inversely 
asset retirement accretion expense 
the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
general and administrative expense 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  managing our production and development operations and legal compliance are included in our general and administrative expense 
we capitalize general and administrative expense directly related to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
interest 
we typically finance our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility  and longer term  with public traded debt instruments 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that correlates to both fluctuations in interest rates and our acquisition activity 
acquisitions are a critical element of our growth strategy 
we expect to continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
we capitalize interest directly related to our unevaluated properties that are not being amortized 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes and are currently in a tax paying position 
prior to  all of our taxes  both federal and state  were deferred  however  during  we utilized all of our net operating loss carryforwards and as a result  we recognized current income tax expense and will continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 

table of contents industry environment we currently operate in north america 
after over years of active natural gas and oil exploration and production within the lower states and gulf of mexico  the region is maturing and production growth is slowing or possibly declining 
numerous technological advances during this timeframe  including increasingly sophisticated geophysical tools that allow more accurate identification of reservoirs  horizontal and other drilling technologies that facilitate and enhance the extraction process  and advanced completion techniques have accelerated both production and depletion rates 
while new discoveries are still being made in north america  the frequency and size of these discoveries is declining while the finding and development costs are increasing 
as a result  given our current technology  domestic natural gas and oil production as a whole may be at or near its peak and can be expected to decline in the future  with the exception of regions such as the rocky mountains 
in this mature environment  companies will find it increasingly difficult to replace their reserves through traditional exploration and development efforts  and companies will increasingly be forced to rely on acquisitions to sustain their growth 
our future success in growing our reserve base at an acceptable finding cost will depend in large part on our ability to acquire new proved reserves and unevaluated acreage on which we can explore 
we currently maintain a very active acquisition program and expect to continue to devote significant resources to identifying and pursuing both tactical acquisitions that augment our existing property base as well as substantial strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that the continued decline of the north american gas basins will lead to higher cost structures throughout our industry 
we currently believe that the cost of finding  developing and producing new natural gas and oil reserves through exploration and development operations will rise as the industry makes fewer discoveries and such discoveries generally tend to decrease in reserve size 
in addition  we believe the acquisition market for natural gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities in north america 
acquisition values climbed toward historic highs during on a per unit basis  particularly in our focus areas of south texas and the rocky mountains  and we expect acquisition values to continue to climb in for full cost companies such as ours  increases in both acquisition and finding and development costs  are expected to yield higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates and ultimately  could increase the likelihood of a writedown in carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties if commodity prices fall substantially below current levels 
in addition  we expect drilling costs  especially in the gulf of mexico  and lease operating expenses to continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields 
like any commodity  the price that we receive for the gas we produce is largely a function of supply and demand 
demand for natural gas is affected by general economic conditions  such as growth in the space heating  industrial and power generation segments  and seasonal conditions 
demand has also typically been impacted by seasonal fluctuations  with the peak demand during the winter heating season and summer air conditioning season 
as natural gas is difficult to import  to of the united states natural gas demand in recent years has been supplied by domestic production 
imports from canada have made up to of the united states natural gas needs and imports from a variety of other countries now make up for to of total supply in the form of liquefied natural gas  or lng 
situations involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
continued concerns over the united states ability to meet its longer term gas needs from declining domestic supply have resulted in sustained prices above throughout  and continuing into as a direct result of the strong commodity prices during  we were able to increase our net income  generate substantial cash flows to fund acquisitions  our capital budget and repay borrowings on our revolving bank credit facility 
however  historically  commodity prices have been very volatile  and we expect the volatility to continue in the future 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and oil prices  and  therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our future revenues and cash flows 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets 
our continued growth and profitability depends on the strength of natural gas prices and our ability to acquire  find and develop new reserves at economical costs 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and prepare estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on a regular basis and discuss the development and disclosure 
table of contents process with our audit committee 
see note summary of organization and significant accounting policies of item contained in this form k for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
proved reserves 
our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of natural gas and oil which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
however  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data and  the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
in addition  as a result of changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from year to year  causing estimates of proved reserves to also change 
for the years ended december  and  we revised our proved reserves downward from prior years reports by approximately bcfe and bcfe  respectively  due to proved undeveloped reserves that were depleted or otherwise not recoverable  or from production performance indicating less gas in place or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our unevaluated properties  our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
unevaluated properties 
the balance of unevaluated properties is comprised of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress  wells pending determination and related capitalized interest 
these costs are initially excluded from our amortization base until the outcome of the project has been determined  or generally  until it is known whether proved reserves will or will not be assigned to the property 
we assess all items in our unevaluated property balance on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we believe that substantially all of the costs included in our unevaluated property balance will be evaluated in the next four years 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated future abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
we estimate the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
we employ a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions  including an inflation rate  our credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability which we compute from third party quotes 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
derivative instruments 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes from counterparties  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  a risk free interest rate and estimated volatility factors 
in addition to the critical estimates discussed above  estimates are used primarily in accounting and computing depreciation  depletion and amortization  the full cost ceiling  taxes  accruals of operating costs and production revenues  effectiveness of derivative instruments and fair value of stock options and related compensation expense 
new accounting pronouncements on september   the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the application of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations aros  by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method 
pursuant to sab  oil and gas producing companies that have adopted sfas should exclude the future cash outflows associated with settling aros aro liabilities from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for the purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation 
in addition  estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  that have been capitalized aro assets should be included in the amortization base for computing depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
disclosures are required to include discussion of how a company s ceiling test and depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations are impacted by the adoption of sfas sab is effective prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after october  since our adoption of sfas on january   we have calculated the ceiling test and our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in accordance with the interpretations set forth in sab  therefore  the adoption of sab had no effect on our financial statements 
on december   the fasb revised statement revised  share based payment that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions eg  issuance of stock options and restricted stock to be 
table of contents recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for us  sfas r is effective for the first quarterly reporting period after june  entities that use the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under sfas are required to apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application 
under this method  an entity records compensation expense for all awards it grants after the date of adoption 
in addition  the entity is required to record compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
in addition  entities may elect to adopt sfas r using a modified retrospective method where by previously issued financial statements are restated based on the expense previously calculated and reported in their pro forma footnote disclosures 
on january   we adopted the fair value expense recognition provisions of sfas as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure using the prospective method as defined by the sfas as a result  we have recognized compensation expense for all stock options granted subsequent to january  with no expense recognized for grants made prior to adoption of sfas r will require us to recognize compensation expense over the remaining service period for the unvested portion of all options granted during  and all options granted prior to are fully vested 
we expect to adopt sfas r on january   using the modified version of prospective application and are currently evaluating the effect of adopting sfas r 
on december   the fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 to clarify the accounting for nonmonetrary exchanges of similar productive assets 
sfas eliminates the exception from the fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the statement will be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not have any nonmonetary transactions for any period presented that this statement would apply 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financials statements 

table of contents overview of results the sustained strength of commodity prices throughout and production growth of generated from all core operating areas were the primary factors behind results for operations  earnings and cash flows for the increase in our cash flows from operations allowed for increased capital spending from prior year levels for drilling and acquisitions and the repurchase and retirement of a portion of our common stock from keyspan

average realized prices include the effect of hedges 
income from operations production growth and higher realized natural gas prices were the primary factors contributing to our increase in operating income in over increased revenues were offset in part by a increase in operating expenses 
higher natural gas prices were the primary factor contributing to our increase in net income and our increase in operating income in over adding to the effects of higher commodity prices realized in was an increase of in production volume from levels 
increased revenues were offset in part by a increase in operating expenses during due primarily to the continued expansion of our operations combined with an increase in costs to maintain our existing production base together with higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates 
production volume vs 
the increase in production for is primarily a result of both production added from gulf of mexico properties acquired during the fourth quarter of as well as newly developed production  both onshore and offshore  from our existing property base 
onshore 
daily production rates increased from an average of mmcfe per day in to mmcfe per day in  despite our loss of approximately mmcfe per day as a result of the divesture of our south louisiana and appalachian basin properties during the first half of the arkoma basin was our onshore growth area during we experienced the full impact of the accelerated drilling program initiated in that continued throughout as we added mmcfe per day in newly developed production 
with three rigs drilling through the first months of  arkoma production reached a record of mmcfe per day during the fourth quarter compared to mmcfe per day during the fourth quarter of for  south texas production increased to an average of mmcfe per day compared to mmcfe per day average daily production rates for arkoma and south texas were negatively impacted during the quarter by our operational curtailment 
as a result of rising rig rates and service costs during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our onshore rig activity to keep capital spending within budgeted levels during the fourth quarter 
in south texas  we went 
table of contents from six rigs to four and in arkoma we went from three rigs to one 
in addition  we deferred the completion of seven wells in south texas capable of producing an estimated mmcfe per day  net  and five wells in arkoma capable of producing an estimated mmcfe per day  net 
by the end of january  we had resumed our six rig program in south texas and add a second rig in arkoma 
we expect to be able to add a third rig in arkoma by the end of the first quarter as our south texas properties begin to mature and production growth to minimize  our strategy will be to maintain production at existing levels while improving drilling and operating efficiencies 
in the rockies  was an exploratory year and our activities were aimed at expanding our acreage position and proving up reserves in several exploration projects on our uinta basin acreage acquired in we drilled a total of wells  in the uinta basin  four in the dj basin and one in montana 
of the total drilled  wells or were successful 
by december  six of our uinta basin wells were producing approximately mmcfe per day  net to our interest 
at december   production from the remaining of our successful uinta basin wells remained delayed  awaiting right of way approval for pipeline construction from the bureau of land management blm 
subsequent to december   we received approval from the blm for pipelines on of the wells 
we estimate initial production rates from these wells  on a combined basis  to be approximately mmcfe per day  net to our interests 
offshore 
we experienced record production growth as average daily rates increased from mmcfe per day during to an average of mmcfe per day during we added approximately mmcfe per day in newly developed production  of which an average of mmcfe per day was attributable to development drilling at high island a and east cameron and during the year  we completed and brought on line seven development wells at high island a  two at ec and one at east cameron all of these fields were acquired in mid october  as part of our acquisition of gulf of mexico properties 
production from these properties accounted for approximately mmcfe per day of our offshore production during partially offsetting the production from our newly acquired properties were declines from existing and maturing fields totaling approximately mmcfe per day  resulting in a net mmcfe per day production increase year over year 
because the majority of our fields are located in the western and central gulf of mexico  hurricane ivan in september  had minimal impact on our results for the year 
we estimate that during the third quarter  approximately  or mmcfe per day was deferred 
all shut in production was fully restored prior to the end of the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we experienced production declines at three key fields 
in november  the high island no 
well depleted 
a third party operates this field and  our working interest is 
prior to depletion  the well produced an average of mmcfe per day to our interest  during in december  our deep well at high island  the no 
 was shut in due to a mechanical problem 
a third party operates the well  and  we have a working interest 
during  this well contributed an average of mmcfe per day to our total daily production 
we expect production to be restored during the third quarter of in late december  our average daily production rate at high island a  dropped by an estimated mmcfe day from approximately mmcfe day as a result of the depletion on a pre existing well and natural decline of newly developed wells 
production volume vs 
the increase in production for as compared to  is primarily a result of newly developed production combined with additions from acquisitions made in and onshore 
daily production rates increased from an average of mmcfe day during to mmcfe day during the increase in onshore production is primarily attributable to newly developed production in south texas and arkoma 
in south texas we drilled successful wells and increased our average daily production rate to mmcfe day during from mmcfe day in in arkoma  we more than doubled the number of wells drilled in by successfully drilling wells during the impact of the newly developed production was seen in the fourth quarter of as our average daily rate in arkoma increased to mmcfe day 
offshore 
production decreased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during for the first nine months of  offshore production averaged mmcfe day as production declines due to maturing reservoirs from existing key fields  mustang island a  high island  west cameron and south marsh island  were greater than new production added from wells and facilities brought on line throughout specifically  we had disappointing results at south timbalier that was brought on line in early contributing to the year over year production decline was the effect of shifting approximately million of our offshore capital expenditure budget to our onshore region to fund the may acquisition of producing properties in south texas from burlington resources 
during the fourth quarter of  offshore production increased by approximately to an average rate of mmcfe day as we began to absorb the properties acquired from transworld in mid october and experienced production increases from newly developed fields  in particular  high island and high island 
table of contents commodity prices and effects of hedging vs 
our average unhedged or sales price for natural gas increased by from per mcf during to per mcf during included in natural gas revenues for is a loss of million from natural gas hedging activities  which includes an unrealized loss of million representing the ineffective portion of our derivative instruments that are not eligible for deferral under sfas the ineffectiveness was a result of changes during the period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which uses a new york mercantile exchange nymex index  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged  the majority of which is the houston ship channel index 
as a result of the loss from hedging activities  we realized an average natural gas price during of per mcf that was of or lower than our average sales price 
during  we incurred a hedge loss from natural gas derivatives of million  which is included in natural gas revenues and includes an unrealized loss of million recognized for ineffectiveness  resulting in an average realized price of per mcf that was of  or per mcf lower than our sales price 
commodity prices and effects of hedging vs 
our average wellhead price during  before the effects of our hedging program  was per mcfe  up over the increase in our natural gas and oil revenues was substantially offset by a million loss from our hedging program  which lowered the price that we realized on our natural gas production by mcf during the period 
the largest portion of this loss resulted from fixed price swaps for natural gas that we entered into during the fourth quarter of in connection with our acquisition of producing properties in south texas 
as a result of these swaps  we effectively fixed the price that we received on approximately mmcf per day at  resulting in a loss of million  or of our total hedging loss for for  we realized an average natural gas price of per mcf  which was of  or per mcf lower than our average unhedged natural gas price or wellhead price of per mcf for the period 
included in natural gas revenues is a loss of million from natural gas hedging activities  which includes an unrealized loss of million representing the ineffective portion of our derivative instruments that are not eligible for deferral under sfas no 
for  we realized an average gas price of per mcf  which was of the average unhedged natural gas price of per mcf for the period 
this resulted in natural gas revenues that were million higher than the revenues we would have achieved if hedges had not been in place during the period 
for  our natural gas revenues included a realized gain of million from hedging activities 
for  we realized an average oil price of per bbl  which was of or per bbl lower than the average unhedged price of per bbl for the period 
as a result of oil hedging activities  oil revenues for were million lower than the revenues we would have achieved if oil hedges had not been in place during the period 
we had no oil hedges in place during and realized an average oil price of per bbl 
operating expenses year ended december  year ended december  operating expenses per mcfe variance variance lease operating expense severance tax transportation expense asset retirement accretion expense depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative  net total operating expenses per unit of production total operating expenses in increased over driven primarily by higher depreciation  depletion and non recurring general and administrative expenses 
on a unit production basis  operating expenses increased per mcfe produced  or  over depreciation  depletion and amortization accounted for of the increase and the additional general and administrative expenses contributed per mcfe 
severance tax was per mcfe lower primarily as a result of exemptions in south texas due to our high cost tight gas formation designation 

table of contents lease operating expense 
on an absolute dollar basis  lease operating expense increased by during this increase relates primarily to our integration of offshore gulf of mexico properties that we acquired during the fourth quarter of these properties originally carried a relatively high operating cost and we are working to bring the cost structure of these properties more into line with our base offshore properties 
although lease operating expense was up in absolute terms in  on a per unit of production basis taking into account our increase in production  lease operating expense increased by only or in while we remain committed to minimizing our operating cost structure  in light of increasing service costs and our continued acquisition activities  we expect to experience upward pressure in our lease operating expense during and beyond 
during  the increase in lease operating expenses as compared to is attributable to the continued expansion of our operations both onshore and offshore 
our overall operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and production facilities and continue to maintain production from existing  maturing properties 
specific increases for were incurred for production enhancement and compression  insurance and contract services 
in addition  we incurred million in non recurring expenses associated with workovers 
the acquisition of the transworld properties in october caused our lease operating expense on a per unit basis to increase from an average of per mcfe for the first nine months of to per mcfe during the fourth quarter of the majority of the transworld fields were originally developed by major oil and gas producers and due to their age and complexity  lease operating expenses for these properties are expected to be significantly higher than that of our existing offshore fields 
severance tax 
severance tax is a function of volume and revenues generated from onshore production 
on an absolute dollar basis  severance tax decreased by from to on an mcfe basis  severance tax decreased by or for the twelve month period 
despite higher wellhead prices during  severance tax expense is lower primarily due to severance tax rebates received late in on our south texas properties as a result of their high cost tight sand designation 
for  the increase in severance tax expense and severance tax per mcfe is due to a increase in average wellhead prices for natural gas during combined with a increase in onshore production as compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the increase in our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for was primarily a result of a higher depletion rate combined with a increase in production for the year 
our depletion rate of per mcfe during was higher than the per mcfe during higher average finding costs per unit were the primary factor in the increase in our depletion rate 
these higher finding costs are the result of the naturally declining productivity of our mature onshore drilling operations compounded by increasing service costs 
rising acquisition prices resulting from the continued strength of natural gas prices were also a factor 
in addition  our estimated future development costs at december  increased from estimates at december   primarily as a result of the future development costs relating to several offshore gulf of mexico properties acquired in october for  producing property dispositions resulted in reserve reductions of bcfe 
finally  for  we incurred downward revisions of bcfe  either due to proved undeveloped reserves that were depleted or otherwise not recoverable  or from production performance indicating less gas in place or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated 
during  the increase in our dd a expense was primarily a result of a higher depletion rate combined with a increase in production volumes for our depletion rate increased during as a result of downward reserve revisions related to reservoir performance of approximately bcfe  the addition of more costs to our depreciation base with fewer additions for reserves as our average finding and development cost increased during  and a increase in our estimated future development costs at year end  the majority of which was due to the proved undeveloped classification of of the reserves acquired from transworld 
asset retirement accretion expense 
the increase in aro accretion expense during as compared to  is primarily a result of additions to our aro liability since the end of the third quarter of as a result of producing property acquisitions  offset in part by the disposition of our south louisiana properties in february and our appalachian basin properties in june

the increase in aggregate general and administrative expense during was due primarily to the expansion of our workforce that corresponds to the continued expansion of our operations 
as our workforce expands  we have experienced an increase in salaries and related employee benefit expenses that include increases in our incentive compensation expense together with expense for stock compensation as we adopted the fair value expense provisions for stock options under sfas  as amended  in january our rent expense increased as we expanded our leased office space in downtown houston to accommodate our growing workforce and opened an office in denver to coordinate our expansion into the rocky mountains 
our legal  audit and accounting expenses increased as we implemented new corporate governance policies required by the sarbanes oxley act of and engaged an outside firm to perform ongoing internal auditing functions 
the higher rate per mcfe during reflects the increase in our aggregate general and administrative expenses combined with a proportional reduction in the amount of general and administrative expense capitalized during the mix of our capitalized expenses has changed as we incurred more costs during that were not directly related to our natural gas and oil exploration and development activities 
we expect that as our company continues to grow and expand  our general and administrative expenses will increase

for  the increase in gross interest expense is due to an increase in both fixed debt and bank debt offset in part by a decrease in average interest rates 
our fixed debt increased in june when we replaced our existing senior subordinated notes of million at with new senior subordinated notes of million at 
bank borrowings averaged million at a rate if during compared to an average of million at during bank debt has increased as we utilized our revolving bank credit facility to fund not only a portion of the keyspan exchange in june but also our two producing property acquisitions in september and october although the majority of our bank debt is at libor rates  we do expect to see an increase in rates during if  based on our belief  the federal reserve continues its expected plan to slowly increase interest rates in an effort to curb inflation 
rates were increased in february  by one quarter of a percent 
capitalized interest is a function of unevaluated properties and the increase for corresponds to the increase in our average unevaluated property balance throughout during  our average borrowings decreased and our average interest rate increased as we replaced our existing fixed debt of million at with new fixed debt of million at and used excess proceeds from the newly issued debt to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility which bears interest at lower rates that averaged during both and bank borrowings averaged million at a rate if during compared to an average of million at during in addition  capitalized interest decreased during our capitalized interest is a function of unevaluated properties and the decrease corresponds to the decrease in our average unevaluated property balance throughout prior to our october acquisition of producing properties from transworld 
income tax provision 
our provision for taxes includes both state and federal taxes 
for the current year  our state tax obligations have increased as our onshore revenues have increased and as we have expanded our operations into several rocky mountain states 
the increase in income taxes for corresponds to the increase in income before taxes 
our current provision increased to million as we utilized all of our net operating loss carryforwards during and moved to a tax paying status 
prior to the third quarter of  the majority of our federal income taxes were deferred 
our current provision for includes million relating to nondeductible excess executive compensation expense of which million was incurred in the second quarter as a result of the special bonus paid to our chief executive officer in connection with the keyspan exchange and million incurred in the fourth quarter as a result of the retirement of our former senior vice president and general manager offshore division 
during  our current provision increased to million as we depleted our net operating loss carryforwards and moved to a tax paying status where  as in prior years  all federal and state income taxes were deferred 
liquidity capital requirements our principal requirements for capital are to fund our capital investment program and to satisfy our contractual obligations  primarily the repayment of long term debt 
our capital investments include the following costs of acquiring and maintaining our lease acreage position and our seismic resources  costs of drilling and completing new natural gas and oil wells  costs of acquiring additional reserves  costs of installing new production infrastructure  costs of maintaining  repairing  and enhancing existing natural gas and oil wells  costs related to plugging and abandoning unproductive or uneconomic wells  and 
table of contents indirect costs related to our exploration activities  including payroll and other expense attributable to our exploration professional staff 
our capital expenditure budget for has been set at an initial level of million 
we are the designated operator of approximately of our wells 
operating allows us the ability to exercise control over the magnitude and timing of our capital program and provides us significant latitude to increase or decrease our spending in response to changes in price  operational developments or acquisition opportunities 
to maintain flexibility of our capital program  we do not enter into material long term obligations with any of our drilling contractors or service providers with respect to our operated properties 
we do not include property acquisition costs in our capital budget because the size and timing of capital requirements for acquisitions are inherently unpredictable 
as the year progresses  we will continue to evaluate our capital spending 
actual levels may vary due to a variety of factors  including drilling results  natural gas prices  economic conditions and future acquisitions 
total company capital expenditures during were million 
we invested million in natural gas and oil properties  which included million for the acquisition of producing properties and  we spent million for non oil and gas property and equipment 
non oil and gas property and equipment includes expenditures to upgrade to our information technology systems and office equipment and compares to million spent in for  we spent offshore and onshore with the balance of on capitalized interest and general and administrative costs 
we completed the drilling of a record gross wells net of which or net were successful and net were unsuccessful with an additional wells net in progress at the end to the year 
the table below provides a five year historical analysis of our capital expenditures for natural gas and oil properties and total net proved reserve additions  that is defined as the sum of reserve extensions and discoveries  revisions and acquisitions

future commitments in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and operating leases 
as of december   we do not have any capital leases or have we entered into long term contracts for drilling rigs or equipment 
as of december   we do not have off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations  and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below  our balance sheet at december   reflects accrued interest payable on our revolving bank credit facility of approximately  which is payable over the next day period 
we expect to make annual interest payments of million per year on our million of senior subordinated notes due june and  we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million

if a significant acquisition opportunity arises  we may also access public markets for debt or to issue additional equity securities 
our primary sources of cash during were from funds generated from operations 
cash was used to fund acquisitions  exploration and development expenditures and to reduce debt under our revolving bank credit facility 
we made aggregate cash payments of million and million  respectively  for interest and taxes during the table below summarizes the sources of cash during and years ended december  variance change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investments in property and equipment net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash at december   we had a working capital deficit of million  long term debt of million and million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility 
the working capital deficit at december   was due to a current liability of million representing the fair value of our derivative instruments estimated to be payable over the next months 
the fair value of our derivative instruments will fluctuate with commodity prices  and as commodity prices increase  our liquidity exposure tends to increase as a result of open derivative instruments 
consequently  we are more likely to have the largest unfavorable mark to market position in a high commodity price environment 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of cash receipts and disbursements for operating activities and borrowings or repayments under our revolving bank credit facility 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital  which is typical of companies of our size in the exploration and production industry 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily attributable to the increase in net income as a result of a increase in average realized natural gas price  which included the effect of hedges  together with a increase in production volume  offset in part by a increase in operating expenses 
fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities are caused by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
during  total long term debt increased by a net million  as we borrowed to finance a portion of the keyspan exchange and to fund the two producing property acquisitions made in september and october of we used net proceeds of million generated from the public offering of  shares of our common stock plus bank borrowings of million to fund the million cash portion of the keyspan exchange whereby we redeemed and cancelled  of our shares held by keyspan with cash value of million 
access to capital markets 
in march  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the offering  from time to time  of up to million of our common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and debt securities  or a combination 
table of contents of any of these securities  as well as for all the shares of our common stock owned at that time by keyspan 
subsequent to the june public offering of million shares at per share  the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the keyspan exchange transaction  we have approximately million of capacity remaining under this shelf registration statement 
on october   we filed a second shelf registration statement with the sec for the offering  from time to time  of up to an additional million of our equity or debt securities 
the combination of the two shelf registrations statements provides an aggregate of approximately million for the offering of our common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and debt securities  or a combination of any of these securities 
we believe that operating cash flow and our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for we continuously monitor our working capital and debt position as well as coordinate our capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
although we have no specific budget for future property acquisitions  should attractive opportunities arise  we believe we could finance the additional capital expenditures with cash on hand  operating cash flow  additional borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility  issuances of additional equity or debt securities or development with industry partners 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements would be scrutinized and disclosed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
our sales price is primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for our natural gas and oil production have been volatile and unpredictable 
interest rate market risk at december   total debt was million  of which approximately or million is fixed at an interest rate of 
the remaining of our total debt balance at december   or million  represents our bank debt that is tied to floating or market interest rates 
fluctuations in floating interest rates will cause our annual interest costs to fluctuate 
during the fourth quarter of  the interest rate on our outstanding bank debt averaged 
if the balance of our bank debt at december   were to remain constant  a change in market interest rates would impact our cash flow by an estimated  per quarter 
commodity risk we utilize derivative commodity instruments to hedge future sales prices on a portion of our natural gas and oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations of natural gas 
our derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits increases in future revenues as a result of favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties are unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
hedging instruments that we use are swaps  collars and options  which we generally place with major investment grade financial institutions that we believe are minimal credit risks 
we believe that our credit risk related to our natural gas futures and swap contracts is no greater than the risk associated with the primary contracts and that the elimination of price risk reduces volatility in our reported results of operations  financial position and cash flows from period to period and lowers our overall business risk  however  as a result of our hedging activities we may be exposed to greater credit risk in the future 
our hedges are cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and  accordingly  we carry the fair market value of our derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and defer unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement as a component of natural gas and oil revenues in the period the hedged production occurs 
if any ineffectiveness occurs  amounts are recorded directly to natural gas and oil revenues 
during both and  we recognized million in each year for ineffectiveness 
the ineffectiveness was primarily a result of changes at the end of the current period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which uses a nymex index  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged  the majority of which is the houston ship channel index
