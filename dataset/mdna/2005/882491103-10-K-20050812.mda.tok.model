item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during all periods presented below  we have been a leading supplier of construction materials through two business segments cement  aggregate and concrete products  or the cac segment  and structural steel and steel bar products  or the steel segment 
through the cac segment  we produce and sell cement  stone  sand and gravel  ready mix concrete  expanded shale and clay aggregate  and other products 
through the steel segment  we produce and sell structural steel  piling products  special bar quality products  merchant bar quality rounds  reinforcing bar and channels 
our cac facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california  with several products marketed throughout the united states 
we own long term reserves of the primary raw materials for the production of cement and aggregates 
our steel facilities produce a broad array of steel products  utilizing recycled steel scrap obtained from crushed automobiles and other sources as the principal raw material 
steel products  sold principally to steel service centers  fabricators  cold finishers  forgers and original equipment manufacturers  are distributed primarily to markets in north america 
both the cac and steel businesses require large amounts of capital investment  energy  labor and maintenance 
corporate resources include administration  financial  legal  environmental  human resources and real estate activities which are not allocated to operations and are excluded from operating profit 
assets identified with corporate resources include cash and cash equivalents  real estate and investments  debt issuance costs and deferred tax assets 
recent developments on december   our board of directors adopted a plan to spin off our wholly owned steel operations in order to permit each of the cac business and the steel business to more efficiently obtain and allocate resources for its distinct business and allow the management of each business to focus on the opportunities and challenges specific to its particular operations 
in anticipation of the spin off  we entered into the following transactions we formed chaparral steel company as our wholly owned subsidiary 
on june   we contributed to chaparral all of our subsidiaries engaged in the steel business 
on july   we contributed or transferred to chaparral real estate and transportation assets used in the steel business 
chaparral assumed all liabilities arising out of the steel business and the transferred assets 
at various times we settled intercompany indebtedness between and among us and our subsidiaries  including our subsidiaries engaged in the steel business 
we settled these accounts through offsets  contributions of such indebtedness to the capital of the debtor subsidiaries and other non cash transfers 
by the effective date of the spin off  we had contributed to the capital of chaparral and its subsidiaries the net intercompany indebtedness owed to us by chaparral and its subsidiaries approximately million at may  
on july   we issued million principal amount of senior unsecured notes due  we entered into a new million senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders  and we terminated our then existing credit facility 
we received net proceeds from our note offering of million  and as of the date hereof we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 
the terms of our new notes and credit facility are more fully described in notes to consolidated financial statements footnote entitled long term debt on pages and on july   chaparral issued million principal amount of senior notes and entered into a new million credit facility 
chaparral used the net proceeds from its note offering and borrowings under its credit facility to pay us a dividend of million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements on july   we used the net proceeds from our offering of notes  the dividend paid by chaparral and existing cash to purchase for cash all of our outstanding million principal amount of senior notes due  or old notes 
we paid a total of million to the holders of the old notes  which was comprised of million of principal  million of accrued interest and million of make whole premiums and consent fees 
the spin off was completed on july  in the form of a pro rata  tax free dividend to our shareholders of one share of chaparral common stock for each share of our common stock owned on july  as a consequence of the spin off on july   chaparral became an independent  public company 
we have no further ownership interest in chaparral or in any steel business  and chaparral has no ownership interest in us 
in addition  chaparral is not a guarantor of any of our indebtedness nor are we a guarantor of any chaparral indebtedness 
our relationship with chaparral is now governed by a separation and distribution agreement and the ancillary agreements described in that agreement 
see liquidity and capital resources spin off of chaparral on page in the first quarter of fiscal year we will record a charge of approximately million related to the early retirement of the old notes and credit facility and an estimated charge of approximately million consisting of the expenses of the spin off 
the loss on the early retirement of the old notes and credit facility consist of the payment of million of make whole premiums and consent fees related to our purchase of the old notes and the write off of million of debt issuance costs and interest rate swap gains and losses related to the old notes and credit facility 
beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal year  we will report the historical results of our steel operations as discontinued operations in our financial statements

the loss was recorded as a decrease in the carrying value of our long term debt and amortized as an adjustment to interest over the remaining term of the senior notes and written off upon the early retirement of the senior notes 
interest expense at million in fiscal year increased million from fiscal year the increase was the result of the june refinancing which increased our outstanding debt million and the effective interest rate on fixed rate debt 
we also entered into interest rate swaps on million of the senior notes such that the interest payable effectively became variable based on six month libor 
loss on early retirement of debt we recognized an ordinary loss on early retirement of debt of million in fiscal year as a result of the june refinancing and may partial termination of our old senior secured credit facility 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in the primary reason that the effective tax rate differed from the statutory corporate rate was due to percentage depletion that is tax deductible and state income tax expense 
we fully utilized our federal net operating loss carryforwards in deferred taxes include a million alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that is available for offset against future regular federal income taxes 
the american jobs creation act of  among other things  allows a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through we are currently evaluating the impact of the new law on our future taxable income 
for financial reporting purposes  any deductions for qualified domestic production activities will be accounted for as a special deduction rather than as a rate reduction 
cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes effective june   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we incur legal obligations for asset retirement as part of our normal cac and steel operations related to land reclamation  plant removal and resource conservation and recovery act closures 
application of the new rules resulted in a cumulative charge of million  net of income taxes of  in fiscal year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and makes provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we and our subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the applicable reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
new accounting standards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the current effective date of sfas r is the first fiscal year beginning after june   which will be the first quarter of our fiscal year ending may  we currently expect to adopt the sfas r effective june  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
financial information for periods prior to the date of adoption of sfas r would not be restated 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees upon the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r will have significant effect on our future results of operations 
however  it will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position 
the impact of sfas r on our results of operations cannot be predicted at this time  because it will depend on the number of equity awards granted in the future  as well as the model used to value the awards 
however  had we adopted the requirements of sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the amounts disclosed in summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which will become effective for the company beginning june  this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
in addition  this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead cost to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which is effective for the company for reporting changes in accounting principles beginning june  sfas no 
changes the reporting of a change in accounting principle to require retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless explicit transition provisions are provided for in new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that are in the transition phase when sfas no

other items environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions  furnace dust disposal and wastewater discharge 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  however  from time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we are or may be in violation of certain environmental laws and regulations 
based on our experience and the information currently available to us  we believe that such claims will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
despite our compliance and experience  it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by us 
market risk historically  we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value 
the fair value of fixed rate debt will vary as interest rates change 
the estimated fair value of each class of financial instrument as of may  approximates its carrying value except for long term debt having fixed interest rates and convertible subordinated debentures 
the fair value of long term debt at may   estimated based on broker dealer quoted market prices  is approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million 
the fair value of convertible subordinated debentures at may   estimated based on nyse quoted market prices  is approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million 
as noted under recent developments  on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of new fixed rate senior unsecured notes and purchased our million aggregate principal amount of old senior notes after which the fair value of our debt did not exceed its carrying value 
our operations require large amounts of energy and are dependent upon energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control 
we have generally not entered into any long term contracts to satisfy our fuel and electricity needs 
if we are unable to meet our requirements for fuel and electricity  we may experience interruptions in our production 
price increases or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of these products could adversely affect our results of operations
