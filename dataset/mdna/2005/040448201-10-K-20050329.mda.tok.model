inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity 
significant accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements prepaid catalog costs and amortization the company accumulates all direct costs  less vendor rebates  incurred in the development  production and circulation of catalogs on the consolidated balance sheets until the related catalog is mailed  at which time such catalog costs are amortized into selling and administrative expense over the estimated sales realization cycle of one year  using the straight line method 
deferred income taxes at december   the consolidated balance sheet contains a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of approximately million  related primarily to federal net operating tax loss carryforwards 
the realizability of this asset is dependent upon the company s generation of sufficient levels of future taxable income and the ability to retain its federal net operating tax loss carryforward position 
as of december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million 
based upon projected future operating results  federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of million are expected to be utilized to offset future federal taxable income primarily through the remaining million of federal net operating tax loss carryforwards are expected to expire unused 
however  events may limit the use of all or a portion of these federal net operating tax lo ss carryforwards  thus potentially resulting in a higher tax liability for the company in the future 
the net deferred tax asset  including the valuation allowance  at december  is subject to future adjustment based upon changes in management s evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
goodwill is deemed impaired if the estimated discounted cash flows or earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
the company has evaluated its goodwill at december  and  and dete rmined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 
defined benefit plans the company accounts for the benefits under its defined benefit pension plan using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension sfas 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads individual events over the service lives of the employees in the plan 
examples of events are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and  therefore  the statement of earnings effects of pension benefits are earned in  and should be expensed in  the same pattern 
in calculating the net periodic benefit cost and the related benefit obligation  the company is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate assumptions reflect the prevailing market rates for long term  high quality  fixed income debt instruments that  if the obligation was settled at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due 
the company uses long term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  as well as future estimates of long term investment returns  to develop its assumptions of the expected return on plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is based on historical experience and the company s long term plans for such increases 
in each of and  a basis point decline in the discount rate assumptions caused a decrease in the funded status of the company s pension plan 
consequently  the company s accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair market value of the plan assets at december  and as required by sfas  the company recorded a non cash  after tax  net charge of 
million and million to the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive earnings in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
this charge did not impact the company s pension expense  earnings or cash contribution requirements in or see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
revenues customarily applying fob shipping point terms  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers

all drop shipment sales are recorded at gross selling price 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the securities and exchange commission sec announced that it had extended the compliance dates for non accelerated filers and foreign private issuers to include in their annual reports a report by management on a company s internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report the sec release 
the internal control reports are required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley act 
the company is a non accelerated filer as defined under relevant sec regulations 
as a result of the sec release  the company will not be required to include internal control reports in its annual report until its annual report  which will be filed by the company in in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services 
sfas r requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize these awards as an expense in the statement of earnings over the requisite service period 
the grant date fair value of employee stock options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which was issue d in october sfas r is effective for all awards granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas r provides for methods of applying this statement to existing awards during the transitional period 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which clarifies that abnormal costs of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material should be recognized as current period expenses 
sfas also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
interpretation r replaces interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company is required to apply interpretation r to interests in variable interest entities vie created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under interpretation r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date interpretation r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
the adoption of interpretation r did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements for and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements for forward looking statements the company believes that this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance  expectations  predictions  and assumptions and other statements which are other than statements of historical facts 
these forward looking statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject  and are qualified by  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or business conditions to differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements 
the company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
as a result  the company s future development efforts involve a high degree of risk 
for further information  please see the company s filings with the sec  including its forms k  q and k 
risk factors if the company s competitors are successful in developing  manufacturing and selling competitive products  the company s operating results could suffer 
the company operates in highly competitive and fragmented markets 
businesses that compete with the company are likely to continue expansion of their product offerings that may erode the company s gross margins 
the broad range of product lines offered by the company is unique to the market as few competitors offer the depth of subject matter in their product mix 
however  each of the company s catalogs competes against a unique list of businesses that specialize in limited numbers of curriculum subjects or markets 
some competitors may be able to commit greater resources to product development  invest greater amounts on capital equipment and marketing plans  or offer more aggressive discounts for its products or services 
in fragmented markets  competitors may further merge and consolidate  increasing market competition 
any of these competitive pressures could have a negative effect on the company s operating results 
if the company is unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the company s success depends on its ability to enhance existing products and services  develop new products  services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of customers and its ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
if the company is unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 
the company is dependent upon the levels of student enrollment in elementary and secondary schools and expenditures per student 
the company s ability to grow the business depends in part on the levels of student enrollment in elementary and secondary schools and expenditures per student 
the level of student enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is largely a function of demographics 
expenditures per student are a function of prevailing political and social attitudes toward education  as well as government budgets 
any significant and sustained decline in the size of the levels of student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have an adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company fails to retain key personnel and hire  train and retain qualified employees  the company may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced sales 
the performance of the company is substantially dependent on the services and performance of its senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of  and the failure to promptly replace  any of the company s executive officers or other key personnel  as well as the company s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel  could have a negative effect on the business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
the company expects its results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and the price of its common stock and series i preferred stock could fall if quarterly results are lower than the expectations of the market 
the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past  and the company s results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
if quarterly results fall below market expectations  the price of the company s common stock and or series i preferred stock could fall 
a number of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  may cause variations in its results of operations including fluctuations in the demand for educational  health  medical technology and agricultural products  seasonality of sales typically experienced by educational supply retailers with peak levels of sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the calendar year primarily due to increased educational shipments coinciding with the fall start of new school years  and fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are and will be related to sales and marketing  product development  technology and infrastructure  which expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
the company s operating expense levels are based in significant part on its expectations of future sales on a quarterly basis 
as a result  if sales for a particular quarter are below expectations  the company may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter  this sales shortfall would have a negative effect on the company s operating results and cash flow for that quarter  which would likely have a negative impact on the price of the company s common stock and or series i preferred stock 
the company s stock price may fluctuate based on factors beyond its control 
market prices for securities of companies comparable to the company are highly volatile
