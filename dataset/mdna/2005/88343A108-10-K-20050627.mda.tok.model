item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we develop  market  manufacture and service process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
process control metrology is used to monitor process parameters in order to enable semiconductor manufacturers to maintain high yields on their production lines  reduce feature size  increase wafer size  increase equipment productivity and improve device performance 
our metrology systems are used in all sections of the semiconductor fabrication plant  or fab  to control the wafer fabrication processes 
examples of wafer fab processes  in which our metrology systems supply information  are photoresist processing to support lithography  deposition of insulator and conductor films  patterned removal  or etching  of insulator and conductor films  ion implantation and chemical mechanical planarization 
we currently sell four product families of process control metrology systems therma probe  opti probe  including opti probe cd  and integra integrated metrology systems 
therma wave develops  markets  manufactures and services process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
our customers must have metrology equipment to improve their yields  
table of contents an essential element to improving their profits 
a significant number or our customers are now expanding their wafer production capacity while simultaneously moving from millimeter to new millimeter technology 
the industry is also advancing to smaller geometries for semiconductor device production  currently at a nm technology node and in the future advancing to nm and nm technology nodes 
we believe these technology advances will significantly increase the requirement to improve yields 
our core products include the latest generations of our therma probe and opti probe metrology systems 
our core markets remain the thin film and ion implant measurement markets 
our latest generation products include our optical rt cd product family and our integrated product line  integra 
all of our latest generation products  which taken together accounted for approximately of our total systems new order bookings in fiscal year  are in keeping with our objective to stay at the forefront of technology leadership in metrology for the semiconductor industry 
our products and technologies for critical dimension and integrated metrology substantially expand our target markets going forward 
therma probe product family 
therma probe systems are non destructive process control metrology systems used to measure the critical ion implantation process on product wafers in the fabrication of semiconductors and utilize our thermal wave technology 
opti probe product family 
opti probe film metrology systems provide one of the industry s most powerful capabilities to control and diagnose non opaque films for semiconductor production 
this metrology capability is achieved by successfully integrating different measurement technologies  including optical technologies that are proprietary to our company  into each opti probe system 
opti probe cd product family 
opti probe cd systems measure the critical dimensions cd  representing the device structures  using a revolutionary  nondestructive technique based on spectroscopic ellipsometry 
these systems are capable of providing cd metrology for the smallest features of the next several generations of ics 
integra product family 
the integra line of integrated metrology products is a broad based family of compact metrology modules which are installed on  and function in conjunction with  an ic process system  such as an etching or cvd deposition system  to provide metrology on each wafer before it exits the process tool 
therma wave has shipped more than  systems since the company introduced its first product in  having shipped to nearly every major semiconductor manufacturer in the world 
our strength has been technology from the beginning of the company 
we have protected our technology with us and foreign patents at the end of fiscal we have a broad range of applications  with products that are reliable and have a low cost of ownership due to their capabilities  not necessarily due to their price 
we have a worldwide customer support organization of approximately people located close to all our major customers 
we have subsidiaries in japan  the uk and china and branch locations or offices in taiwan  hong kong  israel  and ireland  as well as several locations in the us 
we also have representatives or distributors in germany  france  italy  singapore and japan 
during april  we signed an agreement establishing a new exclusive representative  hermes epitek corporation  for our therma probe and opti probe products in taiwan  china  singapore  and malaysia 
following a transition period of about two to three months  we plan to close our branch offices in taiwan and our subsidiary in china 
hermes epitek is a prominent  well established company in our industry in asia  and we expect to improve our position in this region through this association 
therma wave introduced its opti probe real time critical dimension system  opti probe rt cd  in this product combines a powerful computer and therma wave proprietary software with our standard or series opti probe and has moved therma wave into a market not previously served by the company 
opti probe rt cd has positioned us to compete for business previously served by manufacturers of scanning electronic microscopes  known as cd sem 
cd sem is becoming non competitive in certain advanced technologies of nm and smaller nodes 
we believe that our opti probe rt cd product can address some customer cd requirements faster  better and at a lower cost of ownership 
where cd sem is an expensive  low throughput technology  opti probe rt cd can perform the same measurements faster and 
table of contents with better precision 
we believe the superiority of opti probe rt cd will become even greater as fabs move to nm and then to nm nodes  increasing the demand for optics based critical dimension products 
to be competitive  our products must be extendable  provide low cost of ownership and help our customers to continuously meet the ever advancing technology nodes challenge 
some of our customers are currently moving or planning to move from nm to nm and will begin moving to nm as the next step 
they will not purchase products from a supplier who they believe cannot continue to enable that advance and meet those technology changes 
our products have demonstrated the capability to be extendable and meet those challenges in the past  and we believe our products are well positioned to meet those requirements in the future 
also in  we introduced our first integrated critical dimension metrology product  integra  which we sell primarily to tokyo electron ltd  an original equipment manufacturer of integrated circuit process systems 
this product line is a family of compact metrology modules that are installed  on and function in conjunction with  the ic process system 
we are rated as their class supplier for integrated cd metrology on tokyo electron s market leading photoresist track system 
our market based on calendar survey information from a report from a widely recognized industry research group  the total process control market will grow to approximately billion in calendar year of that  approximately billion is expected to be the metrology segment 
we are targeting the transparent thin film  and critical dimension segments of this market  which is estimated to be at approximately billion by the end of calendar year this billion market includes billion for critical dimension measurement  of which a portion estimated at million and rapidly growing  is served by our opti probe critical dimension product 
our goal is to capture at least of this total portion of the metrology market that we serve  plus a significant share of the ion implant process measurement market  and plus normal upgrades and service and support 
the ion implant market is actually included as a small part of the opaque film market by the industry source  and we believe this market will be between million and million in calendar year  most of which we expect to capture 
overview the semiconductor industry struggled for recovery in fiscal  gaining momentum in our fiscal first and second quarters  but slowing in our fiscal third and fourth quarters 
in our fiscal first quarter  we reported an approximately increase in orders from the previous quarter  and in our fiscal second quarter  we reported a sequential increase of approximately over the fiscal first quarter of our order rate for our fiscal third quarter dropped off sharply  down from the previous quarter  then recovered modestly  up in the fiscal fourth quarter 
we expect this soft market to continue at least through the first two quarters of our fiscal year in total  our orders increased by in fiscal over fiscal to million 
in addition to the overall growth in orders it is important to note that our new leading edge products grew as a percentage of our product mix 
the advanced therma probe system grew from or million of total system orders in fiscal to or million total system orders in fiscal our advanced opti probe grew from or million to or million of total system orders includes both op and op cd 
also  of total systems booked during the year were for millimeter business 
we believe this is very significant because it demonstrates that customers are accepting our more advanced products 
geographically  in fiscal  our european business strengthened significantly during our first and second quarters  and we received a large order for our integra integrated metrology im product from our customer in japan in the fiscal third quarter 

table of contents the following table lists the percentage of system orders by region for the years ended march   and percentage of system orders fiscal years ended march  markets asia  excluding japan japan inclusive of the im orders europe united states total orders net revenues for fiscal year net revenues were million  a million increase over fiscal net revenues of million 
during fiscal  quarterly net revenues peaked in the second quarter at million  followed by a million decline in the third quarter to million  and an additional million decline in the fourth quarter to million 
this pattern reflects the industry wide slowdown in purchases of semiconductor metrology capital equipment that began during our fiscal however  it is important to note that we shipped systems billed at approximately million in our fiscal third quarter and at more than million in our fiscal fourth quarter that were recorded as deferred revenue due to a non standard right of return clause in the sales agreements 
we expect those revenues to be recognized during the first two quarters of our fiscal year gross margins gross margins improved for fiscal year to compared to in fiscal the improvement was primarily in the first two quarters  which benefited from the higher sales and manufacturing volumes  sales of inventory previously written down or written off  from cost reduction efforts and a stronger industry economic environment early in the year which helped to strengthen pricing 
gross margins were negatively impacted by the lower sales volumes in the final two fiscal quarters 
both fiscal years and benefited from sales of inventory previously written down or written off  which was primarily parts for mm products that were written off as excess during the downturn years of fiscal and our gross margins were strongest at in our fiscal first quarter  decreasing to in the second quarter  in our third quarter and to in the fiscal fourth quarter 
the first two quarters benefited by million and million  respectively  form the net of sale of inventory previously written down or written off in excess of new write downs of inventory  while that net benefit in the third quarter decreased to million and became negative million in the fourth quarter  when the benefit was exceeded by the new write offs 
our fiscal first and second quarter gross margins benefited from the sale of million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues respectively of inventory that had previously been written off  and were reduced by new inventory charges of million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  respectively 
our fiscal third quarter gross margin benefited from the sale of million  or of revenues  of inventory that had previously been written off  and was reduced by new inventory charges of million  or of revenues 
our fiscal fourth quarter gross margin includes the benefit of million  or of revenues  from the sale of previously written off inventory and the reduction of million  or of revenues  due to new charges to inventory 
fiscal year gross margins included a benefit of million arising from the sale of inventory that had previously been written down or written off and reduced by inventory provision of million 
full fiscal year improvement to included a lower benefit from million from the sale of inventory previously written down or written off and the reduction due to inventory provision of million 
fiscal year 
table of contents gross margins also benefited from million of margin from the conclusion of a customer funded development program that allowed recognition of million of deferred revenue accumulated over several prior years 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  we fully absorbed our factory overhead for the first time in more than two years due to higher production volumes 
this improved absorption level continued on throughout fiscal year and is important because it means that any additional volume growth begins to reduce the average overhead cost per tool produced  thereby reducing the average total cost per tool 
however  our margins continued to be unfavorably impacted by lower than optimum production levels  which are expected to decrease further in our fiscal first quarter the expense of the company s customer service and support organization is allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expense based on the percent average time spent by field personnel on marketing activities 
for fiscal years and  million and million  respectively was charged to cost of revenue and million and million respectively was charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
operating expenses during fiscal  we continued to direct substantial efforts toward managing our operating expenses to be in line with business conditions 
fiscal operating expenses were million  down million from million in fiscal fiscal operating expenses included charges of million for compliance work related to implementation of sarbanes oxley act of section total operating expenses were reduced to million in each of the last two fiscal quarters of however  operating expenses increased by approximately million  or  in the fiscal fourth quarter offset by a non cash credit for the variable accounting treatment for stock options of approximately million in the fiscal fourth quarter 
the credit occurred because our stock price decreased from quarter to quarter 
operating expenses for all costs other than the variable accounting treatment for stock options increased due in part to increased spending for sarbanes oxley section compliance  and due to incurring expenses for a week quarter compared to our normal week quarters 
the reduction in operating expense in fiscal compared to  other than million increase for compliance work associated with the sarbanes oxley act  was due primarily to lower restructuring charges by million and lower stock compensation charges by million 
in fiscal  we expect to manage operating expenses in line with revenues  increasing over time as the business grows  but declining as a percentage of revenues 
balance sheet cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   a decrease of million from the million reported as of december  and down from million reported as of march  cash was used in fiscal primarily to fund operating activities of million 
net inventory increased by million due to the increase in mix of millimeter products  and net accounts receivable was up million 
our receivables days sales outstanding dso ended the fiscal fourth quarter of at days and was increased to days for fiscal fourth quarter  calculated on a look back basis 
this increase was due primarily to late payments from two asian customers  most of which were paid within the first days following the end of our fiscal fourth quarter 
investing activities used cash of million  comprising of million for purchases of property and equipment and million for cost of patents 
we expect such expenditures to remain at similar or lower levels in our fiscal year total liabilities increased by million  with current liabilities up million 
deferred revenues increased by million and accounts payable by million 
the increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to shipments to a european customer during the last two quarters of the fiscal year that were recorded as deferred revenue due to a non standard right of return clause in the sales agreement 

table of contents approximately million of the order was shipped and billed during the december through march time frame and approximately million of that amount was paid before the end of our fiscal fourth quarter  but revenue will not be recognized until the final acceptance process is completed at the customer 
as of march   we have no long term debt  and we have access to a million in credit facilities that are unused other than million for supporting standby letters of credit 
the amount available under our credit facilities is determined using a borrowing base formula  which considers amounts in our trade accounts receivable and inventory  excluding certain aged and past due accounts receivable and inventory at locations outside of the united states  and there can be no assurance that any amount will be available for borrowing under this facility 
this facility also includes a material adverse change clause  which allows the bank to terminate the facility or to demand the immediate payment of all outstanding balances upon the determination of a deemed material adverse change in the company s business  operations  or financial or other condition of the company  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of outstanding obligations  or a material impairment of the value or priority of the bank s security interests in the collateral 
summary we believe that therma wave has made significant progress during its fiscal year for our full fiscal year compared to fiscal total new orders increased by to million  total net revenue increased by to million  total deferred revenue increased to million  gross margin improved to compared to in fiscal  operating expenses decreased by year over year  and net loss was reduced by to million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  see also page for discussion of liquidity and going concern 
we believe it is very important that the sale of our advanced products has continued to increase as a percentage of total new orders received 
advanced products accounted for approximately percent of new orders received for systems in our full fiscal year  up from approximately percent in fiscal during our fiscal fourth quarter  our advanced products accounted for approximately percent of new orders received for systems  most of which were for our mm products 
we expect the sale of our advanced products to remain at that level during fiscal year outlook while we believe we made progress on many fronts in fiscal  the semiconductor capital equipment industry remains a cyclical and dynamic environment  and as such forward looking visibility remains limited 
currently  the industry is again in a downturn  which some industry analysts are projecting to last at least until late in calendar year to help strengthen our position in this challenging environment  we are proactively taking steps to enhance our competitive and financial positioning 
subsequent to our year end  we took two significant actions related to operating expenses 
first  on april   we reduced the number of separate functional groups reporting directly to our ceo from eleven to six  through a combination of consolidation and reduction of our north american workforce by just over percent 
our intentions were to reduce our operating expenses while streamlining our corporate structure in order to increase operating efficiency and reduce our fixed cost structure 
as a direct result of this initiative  we expect to realize annualized salary and related cost savings of more than million 
second  on april   we adopted a plan to restructure our asian operations 
we signed an exclusive representation agreement with hermes epitek corporation  a well known and well positioned representative for semiconductor equip 
table of contents ment firms in asia 
hermes epitek has existing  well established relationships with many of our customers in the region 
by making this change  we are transitioning from a direct sales and service model to an exclusive representative model for the distribution and servicing of our therma probe and opti probe families of metrology products in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia 
we expect a transition period of approximately two to three months  following which hermes epitek will be undertaking essentially all sales and service efforts for our metrology products in their territory 
this new model should be in place by the middle of the second quarter of fiscal year this change is consistent with our strategy to improve the flexibility and cost effectiveness of our operating expense structure  because payments are directly related to the amount of sales volume instead of being essentially fixed 
also  we believe that due to their larger presence in the region and depth of personnel  hermes epitek will be better able to maintain the highly trained technical personnel necessary to provide the highest quality of service and support to our customers in that region 
overall  we believe the above mentioned initiatives will result in continued progress 
as we look forward  we expect to continue to build on these actions  and we also plan to take additional steps focused on implementing the most cost efficient operating structure  delivering the highest possible level of customer satisfaction  improving our cash position and focusing our resources on developing the most innovative metrology solutions available worldwide  all directed toward achieving our ultimate goal of returning therma wave to profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies has a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and returns  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  income taxes and warranty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
revenue recognition effective april   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
in december  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition  which superceded sab sab is a codification of other revenue recognition pronouncements and in substance does not change sab revenues are recognized when our contractual obligations have been performed  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured  sales price is fixed or determinable and customer final acceptance has been obtained  if applicable 
freight terms of sales are normally exworks or fob shipping point unless otherwise negotiated and agreed in written form between our customers and us 

table of contents shipments typically are made in compliance with shipment requirements specified in our customer s purchase order 
system revenues 
equipment sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangement sales that require the deferral of a significant portion of revenues in the amount of the greater of fair market value of installation or the percentage of payment subject to final acceptance 
systems revenues are allocated to each component of the multiple element arrangement 
revenues on each element are recognized when the contractual obligations have been performed  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectability of the sales price has been reasonably assured and customer final acceptance has been obtained  if applicable 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related systems sales are recognized 
revenue related to extended warranty is recognized over the period earned 
systems revenues on newly introduced products are deferred at shipment and recognized upon customer final acceptance 
our standard terms and conditions of sale do not contain a right of return  except for spare parts 
returns of unused purchased spare parts for credit are allowed only within days of shipment and are subject to a restocking fee 
in the past  we have  in unusual circumstances  agreed to accept specific rights to return until completion of the customer final acceptance process 
we may accept such rights again in future orders 
in such cases  the nature of the specific right of return is evaluated under sab topic a b customer acceptance  and if appropriate  revenues are deferred until such right of return expires in accordance with fas in accordance with sab  we evaluate our system sales to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition for each of the multiple elements involved in each sale 
this sometimes results in deferrals of revenues to periods subsequent to the period in which the tool is shipped 
service and parts revenues 
we derive service and parts revenues from three primary sources sale of spare parts  service contracts and service labor relating to our products 
revenues on the sale of spare parts are recognized when title and risk of ownership have transferred to the customer and collectability of the sales price has been reasonably assured 
revenues on service contracts are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
revenues on time and material services performed are recognized when the services are completed  collectability of the sales price has been reasonably assured and  if applicable customer final acceptance has been obtained 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost  approximating average cost  first in  first out method or market 
due to changing market conditions  estimated future requirements  age of the inventories on hand and our production of new products  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
a significant increase in the demand for our product could result in a short term increase of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
when we record provision for excess and obsolete inventory  we create a new cost basis for the inventory 
inventory provisions in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal  and gross margins included benefits from the sale of inventory previously written down of million  million and million  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and returns we utilize estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and reserve for potential returns for credit 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience  any specific customer collection issues that we have identified  and the aging of the accounts receivable 
while such credit losses 
table of contents have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on both the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review of such assets include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
as of march   due to decline in the company s stock price  we performed sfas no 
impairment analysis of the long lived assets and concluded that no write offs are necessary 
during the quarter ended september   we recognized that a downturn in the semiconductor industry had negatively impacted our projected future cash flows and our market capitalization 
our stock price declined from on june  to on september  as a result  we performed a transitional impairment analysis  which considered current operating losses  a decrease in market capitalization below tangible book value  the absence of positive cash flows  and uncertainties resulting from the duration and severity of the industry downturn  and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million in the quarter ended september   which effectively reduced the goodwill balance related to our acquisition of sensys instruments corporation to zero 
we also recorded impairment charges in fiscal of million for developed technology  million for a development contract  and million for trade name intangible assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we cannot conclude  based on available objective evidence  that it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
as of march  and  we concluded that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized through generation of future taxable income 
accordingly  we provided a net valuation allowances for all periods presented 
warranty we provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time  normally one year from system final acceptance  on systems and parts for material and labor to repair and maintain the equipment 
we record the 
table of contents estimated cost of systems and parts warranty upon shipment of the tools  based on the average historical warranty expense for a specific tool 
should actual costs or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
results of operations the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year results of operations net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets restructuring  severance and other stock based compensation expense benefit total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net interest expense interest income other income expense  net total other income expense  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss cost of net revenues decreased as a percentage of net revenues due primarily to the increase in net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  product cost reduction programs and improved industry conditions  particularly early in  strengthening pricing 
operating expenses decreased approximately percent in dollars while revenues increased  thereby reducing as a percentage of net revenues 
these elements resulted in also reducing the net loss as a percentage of revenues 
included in the changes from fiscal compared to fiscal are net of net gross net of net revenues revenues profit loss revenues major changes fiscal compared to fiscal in millions decrease in the sale of inventory that had been previously written off decrease in stock based compensation net revenues increased by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and this increase was the primary reason for cost of net revenues and operating expenses decreasing as a percentage of net revenues  and 
table of contents a resulting reduction of the net loss as a percentage of net revenues 
included in the changes from fiscal compared to fiscal  among other changes  are net of net gross net of net revenues revenues profit loss revenues major changes fiscal compared to fiscal in millions the conclusion of a development contract lower operating expenses due to the fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangibles increase in the sale of inventory that had been previously written off increase in provision for excess and obsolescence fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
compared to fiscal  net revenues in fiscal increased by million or primarily as a result of capital spending increases in the semiconductor industry during the first two quarters of fiscal we sold more units of our therma probe and opti probe products in fiscal and the average selling price increased in fiscal due primarily to a shift in business towards our newer  more expensive models 
we experienced strong price competition during both fiscal and fiscal  however we believe that the increases in industry spending  particularly during the first half of fiscal did strengthen pricing modestly during that period 
we began to be impacted by an industry slowdown during december and for the remainder of our fiscal year the following table summarizes our product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  net revenues products systems services and parts total net revenues the fluctuations in these percentages are related primarily to the changes in the amount of metrology capital equipment being purchased by the semiconductor industry from one year to the next 
sales of services and parts tend to reflect the installed base of products sold one and a half to two years previously and coming out of warranty rather than current product sales 
as a result  the dollars of such sales do not fluctuate as widely as product sales  and therefore represent a higher percentage of total revenues when product sales are lower 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues for each of these two periods 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future  because of the concentration of large customers in asia 
a substantial portion of our international sales is denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products more expensive  however  our major competitors are also mostly us companies and would incur essentially the same pricing impact 
although we have not been negatively impacted in the past by foreign currency changes in japan  korea  china  taiwan  singapore  israel and europe  such conditions could negatively impact our international sales in future periods 

table of contents demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment increased during the first two quarters of our fiscal year  resulting in higher new order booking rates than in the previous fiscal year 
the increased orders resulted in higher revenues for system shipments 
the increased revenues contributed substantially to a reduction of operating losses in fiscal compared to the previous year 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased from in fiscal to in fiscal key contributors to this improvement in gross profits can be summarized as follows gross profit improvement key contributors to gross profit improvement s increased systems revenues decreased service and parts revenues decreased sales of inventory previously written off decreased stock based compensation expense other total systems revenues grew by in fiscal compared to fiscal  contributing to relativity higher gross margins 
service and parts revenues grew by 
decreased stock based compensation expense resulted from a decrease in the year end stock price and contributed million to the increase in gross margins  partially offsetting a decrease from reduced sale of inventory previously written off of million 
included in our gross profit are fiscal years ended march  in thousands inventory provision for excess and obsolescence benefit from the sales of inventory that had been previously written off and obsolescence during fiscal and  as a result of increasing demand for semiconductor products  our gross profits benefited from the sale of inventory that had been previously written off 
inventory charges recorded in fiscal and prior periods had substantially lowered the net value of our mm inventory on hand and the ability to sell this inventory in fiscal and fiscal had a significant positive impact on our gross margin 
the majority of the potential benefit has now been realized by the end of fiscal we have implemented or are in the process of implementing a number of cost reduction measures to improve our overall financial performance 
these cost reduction measures include  but are not limited to  sourcing and design initiatives to lower cost and improve product performance  tight controls on discretionary overhead spending and renegotiation of equipment maintenance contracts with vendors 
we expect these cost reduction measures will continue to contribute to gross margin improvements in fiscal research and development  or r d  expense 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  a reduction of million  or 
r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal due to both lower r d project spending and the increase of net revenues in fiscal we also reduced the use of outside services by million  or 
other discretionary spending and allocations for facilities and information systems support were lower by million  or 
we maintained the resources for our critical programs such as our real time critical dimension product rt cd 
we believe that technological leadership is essential to strengthen our market position in the next economic upturn and expect to continue to commit significant 
table of contents resources to the development of new products and the continuous improvement of existing products 
therefore  we expect to continue to invest in r d during fiscal at levels similar to fiscal selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal increased million  or 
the increase in fiscal sg a expenses reflect fiscal charges of million related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in fiscal additionally  commissions decreased million  or  and other discretionary spending  such as allocations for facilities and information systems support  decreased by million  or 
we expect sg a expenses will be flat to down modestly in fiscal primarily due to lower spending on implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of  section and tight expense controls  and audit 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the quarter ended december   due to the termination of a development agreement  we accelerated the amortization of million of related development contract intangible assets 
restructuring  severance and other 
the following table summarizes the changes in restructuring  severance and other costs during the twelve months ended march  liability as liability as of march  of march  provision payment restructuring  severance and other s consolidation of facilities during fiscal  we recorded million in charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
the additional million was recorded as leased facility charges during the first quarter of fiscal when we changed our estimates of potential sublease income and the sublease date on a previously vacated facility in santa clara  california 
the million charge reflects the difference between the estimated sublease income and the actual sublease income for this facility 
the lease on this facility will expire on march  if facilities rental rates continue to decrease in this market or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the maximum amount by which the actual loss could exceed the liability as of march  is million 
during fiscal  we recorded million of charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
of this amount  million relates to reductions in workforce in april and october of approximately and employees  respectively 
an additional million was recorded as leased facility charges during the second quarter of when we entered into a sublease on a previously vacated facility 
the million charge reflects the difference between the estimated sublease income and the actual sublease income for this facility 
as of the end of fiscal  liabilities that we had accrued for severance and other costs had been paid out in full 
on april and april   we took actions in a restructuring aimed at increasing the company s operating efficiency and reducing corporate expenses 
we reduced the number of separate internal functional groups reporting to the ceo from to by streamlining our corporate structure through a combination of consolidation and reductions in force 
we reduced our north american workforce by approximately percent 
the charge in connection with this restructuring is expected to be approximately million  for severance and related costs  and is anticipated to be recorded during our fiscal first quarter of  ending july  we expect that the restructuring action will result in cash expenditures of approximately million in the fiscal first quarter of on april   we adopted a plan to restructure our asian operations in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia by converting from a direct sales and service organization to one using an exclusive representative 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we will incur severance and other charges relating to termination of or more employees and the closing of leased facilities in taiwan and china  including the cancellation of leases and write offs for certain fixed assets 
the charges in connection with the restructuring 
table of contents plan are expected to be in the range of million to million and will be recorded during our fiscal first and second quarters of we expect the restructuring will result in cash expenditures of approximately million to million in our fiscal first and second quarters of stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we recognized an employee stock based compensation net benefit of million which included a benefit of million related to variable accounting offset by amortization expense of million related to the sensys acquisition 
in fiscal  employee stock based compensation expense of million included expense of million related to variable accounting and amortization expense of million related to the sensys acquisition 
stock based compensation reflect charges for options assumed as part of the acquisition of sensys instruments corporation in january and charges for options issued september  in an employee stock option exchange 
as part of the sensys acquisition  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million or of net revenues in fiscal  and million or of net revenues in fiscal  of which  and  respectively  was included in cost of revenues 
we expect that the stock based compensation for options assumed in the sensys acquisition will  in fiscal  be lower than that of fiscal due to the forfeitures of options held by the sensys employees who left the company in fiscal and due to the complete vesting of the remaining employees 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we commenced and completed an employee stock option exchange program 
the voluntary program allowed our employees  excluding officers and directors  to return to us existing options issued before july  with an exercise price greater than per share and exchange them for new options that were granted on september  the number of new options granted in the employee stock option exchange program was equal to of the number of options canceled in the exchange 
the new option grants have a different vesting schedule from the original option grants and have an exercise price equal to  the fair market value of our common stock on september  of the  options eligible for exchange   options  or  were exchanged for  new options with an exercise price of 
the replacement options vested on june   with the remaining vesting on april  or according to the specific performance vesting schedules of particular stock option grants 
as a result of the modification to the exercise price of the stock options  the replacement options are accounted for as variable from the date of modification until the option is either exercised  forfeited  canceled or expired 
as of march  and  we have recorded approximately million and million  respectively  in deferred compensation expense related to the employee option exchange program 
this charge reflects three groups of options the new options issued in the exchange which were outstanding since september   options eligible for exchange that were not exchanged about of eligible options  and options issued to eligible participants within the six months prior to or following september  due to the options requiring variable accounting treatment  the expense is being recorded for the vesting of these options over time based on increases in the stock price over and above the exercise price of the new options 
in future quarters  the expense could increase as the vesting over time of these options increases and if the stock price increases 
reductions to expense may also be recorded if the stock price decreases  but such reductions will be limited to the net expense previously reported 

table of contents during fiscal  the benefit related to the variable accounting treatment of options was million compared to charges of million in fiscal however  on a quarterly basis these costs varied based on the amount of time the options were outstanding and on the quarter end closing stock price  as follows fiscal year q q q q full year variable accounting charge benefit by fiscal quarter s days outstanding ending stock price variable accounting charge benefit fiscal year q q q q full year variable accounting charge benefit by fiscal quarter s days outstanding ending stock price variable accounting charge benefit we anticipate that expense amounts relating to the employee stock option exchange program will continue to vary from quarter to quarter reflecting both the vesting schedules of the options and the fluctuation in the quarter ending stock price of our outstanding options subject to variable accounting 
our time vesting percentage calculations reflect the vesting schedules of the newly issued replacement options  which vested on june   with the remaining vesting on april  or according to the specific performance vesting schedules of particular stock option grants 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income  net 
total other income expense for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to a lower average balance in the company s investment accounts 
other expense recorded in fiscal includes a loss on the sale of an investment in the first quarter of fiscal in the amount of million 
net loss 
the combination of all the factors discussed above contributed to a net loss of million for fiscal compared with a net loss of million in fiscal we expect that with our cost reduction programs in place and with expected revenue increases in the final two quarter of fiscal  we will continue to reduce our net loss amounts in the full fiscal year this forward looking statement excludes the impact of amounts relating to the variable accounting treatment of the employee stock option exchange program  which we cannot predict  because it is dependant upon the value of our stock  and which may increase our net loss if our stock price increases 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal years ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
compared to fiscal  net revenues in fiscal increased million  or  primarily as a result of capital spending increases in the semiconductor industry 
we sold more units of our therma probe and opti probe products in fiscal and the average selling price increased in fiscal due to a shift in business towards newer  more expensive models 
we experienced strong price competition during both fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents the following table summarizes our product and service revenues in different categories as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  net revenues products service and parts total net revenues the fluctuations in these percentages are related primarily to the changes in the amount of metrology capital equipment being purchased by the semiconductor industry from one year to the next 
sales of service contracts and parts tend to reflect the installed base of systems previously sold rather than current system sales 
as a result  the dollars of such sales do not fluctuate as widely as systems sales  and therefore represent a higher percentage of net revenues when product sales are lower 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for of our total revenues for each of these two periods 
demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment increased during fiscal year as a result  we increased the number of our customers and experienced higher order booking rates than in the previous fiscal year 
the increased orders resulted in higher revenues for system shipments 
the increased revenues materially improved our financial position and results of operations in fiscal compared to the previous year 
gross profit loss 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from a million gross loss in fiscal  a change of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in gross profit was primarily because of increased systems revenues in fiscal key contributors to this improvement in gross profits can be summarized as follows gross profit improvement key contributors to gross profit improvement s increased systems revenues increased sale of inventory previously written off decrease in new inventory provision overhead spending reductions termination of a development contract favorable resolution of accrued tax exposure total roughly one quarter of the improvement in gross profit reflects systems revenue increases 
systems revenues  which contribute relatively higher gross margins  grew by in fiscal compared to fiscal  while service and parts revenues  which contribute relatively lower gross margins  declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal increased demand for systems improved the margins in several other ways  specifically by enabling the sale of inventory that had been previously written off  resulting in a benefit of million  facilitating sales of systems that had been used internally for demonstration and testing purposes  which generally have a lower cost basis than new systems  million  and improving overhead absorption of fixed costs  million 
overhead spending was reduced by over million  due to reductions in labor and discretionary spending in fiscal compared to fiscal these spending reductions contributed approximately to the improvement in gross profit 
approximately of the gross margin improvement is due to the 
table of contents termination of a development agreement in the third fiscal quarter of  in which we recognized million of previously deferred revenues and gross profit of million 
approximately of the improvement is due to the favorable resolution in the third fiscal quarter of of a potential tax exposure in korea that we accrued in fiscal as a result of favorable economic conditions and increasing demand for semiconductor products  our gross profits included million for sales of previously reserved inventory and charges of million in new inventory reserves 
we also scrapped million of previously reserved inventory 
this compares to our gross loss in fiscal year in which we experienced a decline in sales and recorded an inventory provision of million related to excess and obsolete inventories  partially offset by the sale of million of inventory previously written off 
inventory charges recorded in fiscal had substantially lowered the net value of our mm inventory on hand and we received some benefit the sale of our excess mm inventory in fiscal research and development  or r d  expense 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  a reduction of million  or 
r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal due to both lower r d spending and the increase of net revenues in fiscal during fiscal year  in part due to reductions in force  labor and benefits costs were lower by million  or 
we also reduced the use of outside services by million  or 
spending on project materials declined by million  or 
other discretionary spending and allocations for facilities and information systems support declined by million  or 
we maintained the resources for our critical programs such as our real time critical dimension product  or rt cd 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal decreased million  or 
the decrease in fiscal sg a expenses reflects lower headcount  partially due to reductions in force  resulting in savings of million  or 
spending on outside services declined by million  or 
commissions  however  increased by million in compared to reflecting increased orders and revenues 
other discretionary spending  such as travel and entertainment and allocations for facilities and information systems support declined by million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the quarter ended september   we recognized that a downturn in the semiconductor industry had negatively impacted our projected future cash flows and our market capitalization 
our stock price declined from on june  to on september  as a result  we performed a transitional impairment analysis  which considered current operating losses  a decrease in market capitalization below tangible book value  the absence of positive cash flows  and uncertainties resulting from the duration and severity of the industry downturn  and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million in the quarter ended september   which effectively reduced the goodwill balance related to our sensys acquisition to zero 
the initial fair value of the sensys reporting unit had been established at the date of acquisition  january   based on the purchase price at the time of acquisition  million 
the value of the specific assets acquired through the sensys acquisition were established in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  in which the cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired on the basis of their fair value at the date of the acquisition 
any purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
sfas no 
sets forth detailed guidelines for determining the fair value of individual assets acquired  stating that an intangible asset acquired in a business combination shall be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset meets one of the following criteria it arises from contractual or other legal rights  or it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired enterprise and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 

table of contents during the quarter ended december   due to the termination of a development agreement  we accelerated the amortization of million of the related development contract intangible assets 
restructuring  severance and other 
the following table summarizes the changes in restructuring  severance and other costs during the twelve months ended march  in thousands liability as liability as of march  of march  provision payments restructuring  severance and other s severance and workforce reduction consolidation of facilities other costs total during fiscal  we recorded million in charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
of this amount  million relates to reductions in force in april and october of approximately and employees  respectively 
an additional million was recorded as leased facility charges during the second quarter of when we entered into a sublease on a previously vacated facility 
the million charge reflects the difference between the estimated sublease income and the actual sublease income for this facility 
as of the end of fiscal  liabilities that we had accrued for severance and other costs had been paid out in full 
during fiscal  we recorded million in charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
we closed down two facilities in santa clara  california to reduce operating expenses and recorded a million charge associated with the abandonment of leased facilities and write off of fixed assets 
we also implemented two reduction in force programs affecting approximately people and recorded million of severance and workforce reduction and million of other severance related costs 
stock based compensation 
in fiscal  employee stock based compensation expense of million included expense of million related to variable accounting and amortization expense of million related to the sensys acquisition 
in fiscal  employee stock based compensation expense of million represented amortization expense related to the sensys acquisition 
stock based compensation reflect charges for options assumed as part of the sensys acquisition in january and charges for options issued september  in the employee stock option exchange offer 
as part of the sensys acquisition  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million  or of net revenues in fiscal  and million  or of net revenues in fiscal  of which  and  respectively  was included in cost of revenues 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we commenced and completed an employee stock option exchange program 
the voluntary program allowed therma wave employees  excluding officers and directors  to return to us existing options issued before july  with an exercise price greater than per share and exchange them for new options that were granted on september  the number of new options granted in the employee stock option exchange program was equal to of the number of options canceled in the exchange

other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income  net 
total other income expense for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower interest income of million resulting from lower average interest rates as well as lower average investment balances that declined approximately million from fiscal to fiscal  offset by million in interest refunded from the internal revenue service in fiscal other expense recorded in fiscal includes a loss on the sale of an investment in the first quarter of fiscal in the amount of million 
net loss 
the combination of all the factors discussed above contributed to a net loss of million for fiscal compared with a net loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the consolidated financial statements contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we reported net losses of million  million and million in fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  and cash used in operations of million  million and million in those respective years 
due to the continued instability in the semiconductor industry and the related instability in the semiconductor capital equipment industry  uncertain economic conditions worldwide  and other factors  we cannot predict how long we will incur further losses or whether we will become profitable again 
moreover  in part due to these downturns  for the year ended march   we recorded million for the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets  inventory provision  restructuring  severance and other costs related to reductions in work force 
we cannot assure you that our business will not continue to decline or when or if performance will improve 
these factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern in their report included in item of this form k 

table of contents our principal sources of funds have been and are anticipated to be cash on hand million unrestricted as of march   cash flows from operating activities if any  borrowings under our bank credit facilities if available  see discussion of material adverse change clause below and the sales of common stock  preferred stock or other securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt  these securities could have rights  privileges or preferences senior to those of our common stock  and debt covenants could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of equity or debt could result in additional dilution to current stockholders  and such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to raise additional funds may adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amount or classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we implemented a restructuring and reduced our north american headcount by approximately percent to bring operating expenses closer in line with our revenue projections 
we also signed an exclusive representation agreement with hermes epitek corporation to serve as an exclusive representative in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia to sell and service our therma probe and opti probe family of metrology products 
we believe that this agreement will give us a more flexible cost structure for the asia pacific region 
we intend to take other actions  yet to be fully defined  to further reduce our operating expense structure and to provide additional cash to meet our operating needs 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or that such financing will be on terms satisfactory to us 
on june   the company and silicon valley bank entered into i an amended and restated loan and security agreement  and ii a streamline facility agreement  that renewed a million revolving line of credit to the company 
the revolving line of credit can be used to i borrow funds for working capital and general corporate purposes  ii issue letters of credit  iii enter into foreign exchange forward contracts  and iv support certain cash management services 
the loan and security agreement also includes a material adverse change clause  which allows the bank to terminate the facility or to demand the immediate payment of all outstanding balances upon the determination of a deemed material adverse change in the company s business  operations  or financial or other condition of the company  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of outstanding obligations  or a material impairment of the value or priority of the bank s security interests in the collateral 
on june   the revolving line of credit matures and silicon valley bank s commitment to extend revolving loans these agreements terminates 
our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital and general corporate purposes 
our cash and cash equivalent balances decreased by million during fiscal year to million as of march  this compares to an increase of million during fiscal year to million as of march  from million as of march  the march  figure also included restricted cash of million 
the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in net proceeds from sale of million shares of the company s common stock in a private placement in september in the private placement  we raised million of gross proceeds and incurred million of issuance costs  million of which were payable to needham company who acted as placement agent 
working capital requirements in fiscal year included an increase in inventories  of million  excluding million of non cash inventory provision  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
this increase in inventories of million resulted from a movement to more expensive millimeter technology in anticipation of increased demand for our millimeter product 
our customers must have metrology equipment to improve their yields  an essential element to improving their profits 
a significant number or our customers are now expanding their wafer production capacity while simultaneously moving from millimeter to new millimeter technology 
we believe these technology advances will significantly increase the requirement to improve yields 

table of contents during fiscal  million in cash was generated by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable increased by only million  even though net revenues increased percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal changes in inventories  excluding a million inventory provision  were an increase of million 
inventory receipts were approximately equal to inventory reductions due to the sale  scrap and internal use of inventory 
benefit from the sale of inventory that had been previously written down was million 
we also scrapped inventories that had originally cost million but that had been previously fully written off 
accounts payable increased million in fiscal year accounts payable increases reflected the fact that our purchase of new parts increased due to increased net revenue and a growing requirement to provide parts for our more advanced products 
deferred revenues decreased by million reflecting the termination of a development contract for which million in deferred revenues were recognized 
reduction in other assets contributed million in cash  and decreases in accrued and other liabilities used million in cash 
during the fiscal year ended march   net cash used by investment activities was million 
cash used in investing activities includes investments in property and equipment and investments in our patent portfolio 
investments in property and equipment amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
investments in our patent portfolio were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  reflecting our ongoing commitment to technology inventions and patent protection 
during the fiscal year ended march   net cash used by investing activities for purchase of patents and property and equipment was million and million  respectively  partially offset by proceeds from sale of an investment of million 
we expect investments in property and equipment in fiscal year  which will consist primarily of computer and test equipment  along with investments in patents  to continue at the relatively low levels of recent years 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the million  net of million of issuance costs  raised in the sale of million shares of the company s common stock in a private placement in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal cash totaling million and million  respectively  was raised through the issuance of common stock  including the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and equity incentive plan

these factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph in its report  which is included elsewhere in this form k 
we need to have sufficient cash to operate if our business is to succeed 
our principal sources of funds have been and are anticipated to be cash on hand million unrestricted as of march   cash flows from operating activities if any  borrowings under our bank credit facilities if available see discussion of material adverse change clause below and the sales of common stock  preferred stock or other securities

subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we implemented a restructuring and reduced our north american headcount by approximately percent to bring operating expenses closer in line with our revenue projections 
we also signed an exclusive representation agreement with hermes epitek corporation to serve as an exclusive representative in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia to sell and service our therma probe and opti probe family of metrology products

there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or that such financing will be on terms satisfactory to us 
failure to raise additional funds may adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives 
we have implemented various cost reduction programs during the past few years to bring operating expenses in line with revenue projections 
as discussed above in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report on form k  on april and april   we took actions that included reducing our north american workforce by approximately percent  which we expect to result in cash expenditures of approximately million in the fiscal first quarter of  and then to result in annualized salary and related cost savings of more than million 
also  on april   we adopted a plan to restructure our asian operations in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia by converting from a direct sales and service organization to one using an exclusive representative  which will result in termination of or more employees and the closing of leased facilities in taiwan and china  which we expect to result in cash expenditures of approximately million to million in our fiscal first and second quarters of  but to improve the flexibility and cost effectiveness of our operating expense structure  because payments are directly related to the amount of sales volume instead of being essentially fixed 
we intend to take other actions  yet to be fully defined  to further reduce our operating expense structure and to provide additional cash to meet our operating needs 
we believe that with these cost reduction actions designed to improve our profitability  along with access to borrowings  if needed and available  under our bank credit facilities and potentially the sale of common stock  preferred stock 
table of contents or other securities through one or more private placements  and other potential funds raising actions  we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our current and future financial obligations for at least the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  if required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
we may incur indebtedness in the future under our bank credit facilities  which could require the use of a portion of our cash flow and may limit our access to additional capital 
as of march   we had million in outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility with silicon valley bank 
we may incur further indebtedness to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital or for other purposes 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences for us such as the following a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations  if any  would be required to be dedicated to the repayment of indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes  our future ability to obtain additional debt financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  and our level of indebtedness has in the past  and could in the future  limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry  general economic conditions and our ability to withstand a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor and or semiconductor capital equipment industries 
our bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation and contains a material adverse change clause 
the company has access to million in credit facilities that are unused other than for supporting standby letters of credit 
however  the amount available under our credit facilities is determined using a borrowing base formula  which considers amounts in our trade accounts receivable and inventory  excluding certain aged and past due accounts receivable and inventory at locations outside of the united states  and there can be no assurance that any amount will be available for borrowing under this facility 
this facility also includes a material adverse change clause  which allows the bank to terminate the facility or to demand the immediate payment of all outstanding balances upon the determination of a deemed material adverse change in the company s business  operations  or financial or other condition of the company  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of outstanding obligations  or a material impairment of the value or priority of the bank s security interests in the collateral 
our performance is affected by the cyclicality of the semiconductor device industry  which may  from time to time  lead to decreased demand for our products 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which have often resulted in a decrease in the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including process control metrology systems 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors 
we are currently experiencing a period of low demand for process control metrology systems  and we cannot be sure that this favorable trend will continue  or if it does not continue then when the semiconductor industry will recover  or whether the recovery will result in increased demand for our capital equipment by the semiconductor industry 

table of contents our quarterly operating results have historically and may  in the future  vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price for our shares 
our quarterly operating results have historically and may  in the future  vary significantly 
some of the factors that may influence our operating results and that could cause trading in our shares to be subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in a given quarter include customer demand  which is influenced by economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  demand for products that use semiconductors  market acceptance of our products and those of our customers  seasonality  changes in product mix  and the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  competition  such as competitive pressures on prices of our products  the introduction or announcement of new products by us or our competitors and discounts that may be granted to customers  fluctuations in the availability and cost of components  subassemblies and production capacity  expenses incurred in connection with litigation  product development costs  such as increased research  development  engineering and marketing expenses associated with new products or product enhancements  and the effect of transitioning to new or enhanced products  and levels of fixed expenses relative to revenue levels  including research and development costs associated with product development 
during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in operating results 
in addition  because of the significantly different gross margins attributable to our different product lines  changes in product mix may cause fluctuations in operating results 
lack of effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in an inability to accurately report our financial results that could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
effective internal control over financial reporting is essential for us to produce reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial information or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
in connection with our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of april   management identified the following two control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses as of april   the company did not maintain effective controls over intercompany accounts 
specifically  the company did not have effective controls to ensure that intercompany account balances were reconciled timely and properly eliminated in consolidation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this control deficiency did not result in an adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
however  this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
accordingly  management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 
as of april   the company did not maintain effective controls over the documentation  review and approval of journal entries to allocate certain customer service and support costs between cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expense 
this control deficiency did not result in an adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
however  this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the previously noted statement of operations accounts  that would result in a material 
table of contents misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
accordingly  management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 
because of these material weaknesses  management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of april   based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the trading commission 
a failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  including a failure to implement corrective actions to address the control deficiencies identified above  could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 
this  in turn  could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our largest customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
accordingly  our business may be adversely affected by the loss of  or reduced purchases by  one or more of our large customers 
if  for any reason  any of our key customers were to purchase significantly less of our products in the future  such decreased level of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended march   three customers represented approximately  and of our net revenues 
during the year ended march   four customers represented approximately   and of our net revenues 
during the year ended march   one customer represented of our net revenues 
as customers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers  we expect that our customer base will continue to become more concentrated with a limited number of customers accounting for a significant portion of our revenues 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others 
our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal product families  and we rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology 
we have obtained a number of patents relating to each of our products and have filed applications for additional patents 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be approved  that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable  that any patents owned by or issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that these patents will not be challenged by any third parties 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not design around our patents 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition to patent protection  we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology 
we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties 
we license and will continue to license certain technology used in our products from third parties 
our inability to acquire any third party licenses  or integrate the related third party technologies into our products  could result in delays in our product developments and enhancements until equivalent technologies can be identified  licensed or integrated 
we may also require new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves 
we cannot assure you that these licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 

table of contents our commercial success will also depend  in part  on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties 
if we are found to infringe or misappropriate a third party s patent or other proprietary rights  we could be required to pay damages to such third party  alter our products or processes  obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights  including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights 
if we are required to do any of the foregoing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
our inability to do any of the foregoing on commercially favorable terms could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
protection of our intellectual property rights  or third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us  may result in litigation  the cost of which could be substantial 
there are currently no material legal proceedings pending against us 
we may be required to initiate additional litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed to us or to determine the scope and or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights 
from time to time  the company receives letters from third parties threatening to file lawsuits to enforce such third parties intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to additional lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming and  as discussed above in the prior risk factor  could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third party technology and  consequently  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we operate in the highly competitive semiconductor capital equipment industry and compete against larger companies 
we operate in the highly competitive semiconductor capital equipment industry and face competition from a number of competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources and broader product offerings than therma wave 
we cannot assure you that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors 
many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new products aimed at applications we currently serve 
our competitors in each product area can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics 
in addition  we believe that our competitors sometimes provide demonstration systems to semiconductor manufacturers at no cost 
we are required to employ similar promotions in order to remain competitive and this practice may become more pervasive in the industry 
competitive conditions in our industry may require us to reduce our prices 
due to competitive conditions in our industry  we have at times selectively reduced prices on our products in order to maintain our market share 
these reductions are not necessarily permanent nor do they affect all of our products 
there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not necessitate further price reductions 
maintaining technological advantages to mitigate the adverse effect of pricing pressures will require a continued high level of investment by us in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
to the extent our products do not provide technological advantages over products offered by our competitors  we are likely to experience increased price competition or loss of market share with respect to such products 
we encounter difficulties in soliciting customers of our competitors because of high switching costs in the markets in which we operate 
we believe that once a device manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  that manufacturer generally relies upon that vendor s equipment for that specific production line application and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of that vendor s systems 
accordingly  it may be difficult to 
table of contents achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another vendor s capital equipment has been selected by that customer unless there are compelling reasons to do so  such as significant performance or cost advantages 
our future growth depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products for the semiconductor industry 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our product development efforts or that our new products will gain general market acceptance 
our future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our failure to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop  manufacture  assemble or introduce new products could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects 
for example  we expect our product development efforts to include continuing to combine separate metrology systems into one tool  implementing integrated systems and networking these systems together 
integrated systems allow us to measure product wafers and monitor process equipment during the semiconductor fabrication process 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to these products or that we will be successful in developing these products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that these products will gain market acceptance or that we will not experience reliability or quality problems 
our operations are characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development and  as a result  our ability to reduce costs is limited 
our operations are characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development and extensive ongoing customer service and support capability 
as a result  our operating results could be materially adversely affected if our level of revenues is below expectations 
in addition  because of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  there can be no assurance that our operating costs will not increase in the future 
rapid technological changes in our industry will require us to continually develop new and enhanced products 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction could result in a loss of competitiveness and could materially adversely affect our operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner  that any product enhancement or new product developed by us will gain market acceptance  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technology in our product markets could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly in light of the fact that we currently derive a major portion of our revenues from sales of our two major product families  the opti probe including opti probe cd and therma probe 
we will need to be able to attract and retain key personnel with knowledge of instruments used in semiconductor manufacturing processes to help support our future growth 
competition for such personnel in our industry is high 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management  engineering  sales and marketing  customer support  finance and manufacturing personnel 
the loss of the services of key personnel  who would be extremely difficult to replace  could have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that the services of such personnel will continue to be available to us 
we have employment agreements with some key members of our senior management team  including messrs 
lipkin  christie  passarello and opsal 
to support our future growth  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
competition for such personnel in our industry and in the silicon valley is high  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

table of contents we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or limited group of suppliers  the partial or complete loss of which could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our operations 
some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving orders from some of these suppliers 
although we seek to reduce dependence on these sole and limited source suppliers  the partial or complete loss of these sources could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with manufacturing all of our products at a single facility 
any prolonged disruption in the operations of that facility could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we produce all of our products in our manufacturing facility located in fremont  california 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  requiring sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction of or damage to this facility as a result of an earthquake  fire or any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we rely upon manufacturers sales representatives for a significant portion of our sales 
a disruption in our relationship with any sales representative could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our sales have historically been made through manufacturers sales representatives  and we expect this percentage to increase since we are in the process of establishing hermes epitek corporation as our exclusive representative in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia 
the activities of these representatives are not within our control  and they may sell products manufactured by other manufacturers 
in addition  in some locations our manufacturing sales representatives also provide field service and support to our customers 
a reduction in the sales efforts or financial viability of such manufacturers sales representatives  or a termination of our relationship with such representatives  could have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial results and ability to support our customers 
although we believe that we maintain good relations with our sales representatives  there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue 
our net sales and results of operations can be adversely affected by the instability of asian economies  from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues 
our sales to customers in asian markets represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
companies in the asia pacific region  including japan and taiwan  each of which accounts for a significant portion of our business in that region  are currently experiencing uncertainties in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these instabilities may adversely affect our sales to semiconductor device and capital equipment manufacturers located in these regions in the coming quarters 
we have recently began changing the way we market and sell our products in certain countries in asia  one of our largest markets 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our sales in that region will be in line with historical trends 
our new relationship with hermes epitek changes the way we sell our products in taiwan  china  singapore and malaysia 
previously  we had sales facilities and staff in taiwan  china and singapore who covered these countries for us 
we have now closed our own facilities in these locations and intend to use 
table of contents hermes epitek exclusively to market our products there 
we expect that our relationship with hermes epitek will improve our sales and service while simultaneously adding flexibility to our cost structure and decreasing difficulties in managing staffing and other elements of foreign subsidiary and branch operations  but there is no guarantee that this will occur 
since sales to customers in these countries represent such a large percentage of net revenues for the last three years  any reduction in our sales in these countries as a result of the new arrangement with hermes epitek could have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to operational  financial  political and foreign exchange risks due to our significant level of international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
due to the significant level of our international sales  we are subject to material risks  which include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers  political and economic instability  potentially adverse tax consequences  outbreaks of hostilities  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  extended payment terms  difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives  and difficulties in managing staffing and other elements of foreign subsidiary and branch operations 
in addition  the laws of countries in which our products are or may be sold may not provide our products and intellectual property rights with the same degree of protection as the laws of the united states 
a substantial portion of our international sales is denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
such conditions could negatively impact our international sales 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other harmful consequences 
from time to time  we may acquire or make significant investments in complementary companies  products and technologies 
the following risks are common to the integration of two companies  and may be associated with recent or future acquisitions the difficulty of incorporating new operations  technology and personnel into one company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the additional expense associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers 
other than our acquisition of sensys in january  we have no experience in managing this integration process 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions or mergers may not be realized 
future acquisitions or mergers could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other tangible assets  any of which could be harmful to our business 
future acquisitions or mergers may require us to obtain additional equity or debt 
table of contents financing  which may not be on favorable terms or at all 
even if available  this financing may be dilutive 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problem that we encounter in connection with any future acquisitions 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit changes in control of therma wave not approved by our board of directors and could limit the circumstances in which a premium may be paid for the common stock in proposed transactions  or a proxy contest for control of the board may be initiated 
these provisions provide for a classified board of directors  a prohibition on stockholder action through written consents  a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chief executive officer or the board of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  and the authority of the board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board may determine 
we will also be afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have similar effects 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb approved eitf issue determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds which addresses an issue in the application of paragraph of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in november  the fasb delayed until further notice the effective date of this issue 
we do not expect any material impact of the disclosure requirements of eitf issue on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are intended to improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb and supersedes apb no 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for good or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments must be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
in addition  sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value and that the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
the effective date 
table of contents of sfas r for the company is for the first annual period beginning after june   ie our fiscal year ended march  although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instrument issues under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no 
r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payments arrangements upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sab will have on our results of operations and financial position when we adopt it in fiscal in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet commitments our off balance sheet commitments are limited to equipment operating leases  leases on office and manufacturing space and certain software license agreements  and commitments to vendors related to non cancelable purchase orders 
future payments due under these obligations as of march  are as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations s operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty payments cancellation fees total operating leases 
operating lease obligations are primarily related to administrative  r d and manufacturing facilities necessary to conduct the company s business 
these leases are non cancelable and expire at various dates through certain of our facility leases include a provision to extend the lease term  including the lease for our primary headquarters and manufacturing facility in fremont  california  which includes options to extend to february our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based upon previously negotiated or consumer price indexed adjustments  or in the case of extensions  generally market adjusted rates 
purchase commitment and cancellation fees 
in order to maintain a supply of inventory components based upon our expected product shipments  we regularly enter into purchase commitments for inventory  
table of contents supplies and services with third party vendors 
generally the purchase commitments are non cancelable and we may not be able to renegotiate the delivery dates or total commitment 
in certain instances we may pay a cancellation fee to cancel the purchase commitment 
our policy with respect to all purchase commitments is to record losses  if any  when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
we have made adequate provisions for any potential exposure related to inventory on order that may go unused based upon our current expectations 
minimum royalty payments 
minimum royalty payments represent the payment obligations for use of third party intellectual property  which will be due irrespective of product shipment volumes 
we indemnify some of our suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorney fees related to any misuse by us of the third party intellectual property 
no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions as of march  effective april   therma wave entered into an exclusive representative agreement with hermes epitek corporation  under which hermes epitek became an exclusive representative within certain countries to sell and service our therma probe and opti probe families of metrology products 
pursuant to the terms of this agreement  hermes epitek will serve as the exclusive representative for our therma probe and opti probe metrology product lines for china  malaysia  singapore and taiwan 
therma wave will pay hermes epitek a commission on the sale of these products when the products are installed within one of the enumerated territories and where the sales process or purchasing decision was directly influenced by hermes epitek 
additionally  hermes epitek will provide our customers with technical support services for the products  including  among other things  installation services and qualification testing 
the term of this agreement with hermes epitek is twenty four months  with a provision for automatic renewal for additional twelve month terms 
credit facilities in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb 
the agreement includes a million domestic line of credit  including a sub limit of million for letters of credit  and a million export import bank of the united states  or exim  guaranteed revolving line of credit 
the bank credit facility allows us to borrow money under the domestic line bearing a floating interest rate equal to the svb prime rate plus as of march  
the exim revolving line allows us to borrow money at a floating interest rate equal to the svb prime rate plus as of march  
we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed the lesser of million total under the two lines or the borrowing base  in each case minus the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit  including any drawn but un reimbursed letters of credit 
our borrowings under the svb and exim guaranteed credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of march   and  we had and million  respectively  in outstanding letters of credit under this agreement 
the credit facilities were to mature on june   but were renegotiated in june and extended for a period of two years 
the svb credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other requirements impose limitations with respect to the change of business location and ownership  incurrence of indebtedness  the payment of dividends  investments  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company is also required to satisfy certain financial tests under the credit facility including tests related to the company s quick ratio and profitability 
as of march   the company was in violation of the covenants of the credit facility agreement by delivering borrowing base certificates and reports on forms k filed with the securities and exchange commission outside of the required reporting periods 
the company was also in violation of the profitability covenant as defined 
all violated covenants were waived by svb in june on june   the company and silicon valley bank entered into i an amended and restated loan and security agreement  and ii a streamline facility agreement  that renewed a million 
table of contents revolving line of credit to the company 
the revolving line of credit can be used to i borrow funds for working capital and general corporate purposes  ii issue letters of credit  iii enter into foreign exchange forward contracts  and iv support certain cash management services 
the loan and security agreement also includes a material adverse change clause  which allows the bank to terminate the facility or to demand the immediate payment of all outstanding balances upon the determination of a deemed material adverse change in the company s business  operations  or financial or other condition of the company  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of outstanding obligations  or a material impairment of the value or priority of the bank s security interests in the collateral 
on june   the revolving line of credit matures and silicon valley bank s commitment to extend revolving loans these agreements terminates 
inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the fiscal years ended march   and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
see also the discussion of forward looking statements above 
market risk related to interest rates and foreign currency we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relation to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates to our cash investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  which consists of only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have minimal cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash and cash equivalents because interest income earned on our cash investments is considered immaterial 
our cash investment portfolio is invested at market interest rates 
as of march   our cash and cash equivalents included money market securities and investment grade commercial paper 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risks we are primarily a us dollar functional currency entity 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales 
we have determined that the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency as our international operations incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies create gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency transaction gains losses are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations and were not material for all periods presented 
we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars leads to a translation gain or loss 
the accumulated effects of foreign translation rate changes related to net assets located outside the us are included as a component of stockholders equity 
as of 
table of contents march  and accumulated other comprehensive losses of million consist of foreign currency translation adjustments  net of tax 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
