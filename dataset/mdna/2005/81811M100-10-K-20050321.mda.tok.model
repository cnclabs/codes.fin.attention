loans sold in the secondary market are primarily sold to investors with which the bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
these loans are made in conformity with standard underwriting criteria to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market  and are approved either by the bank s underwriter or the correspondent s underwriter 
loans considered for the bank s portfolio are approved by the bank s loan committee  which is comprised of the executive vice president and the senior vice president 
meetings of the loan committee are open to attendance by any member of the bank s board of directors who wishes to attend 
the loan committee reports to and consults with the board of directors in interpreting and applying the bank s lending policy 
loans that are sold are typically long term or more years loans with fixed interest rates eligible for resale in the secondary market 
loans retained for the bank s portfolio include construction loans  commercial loans and loans that periodically reprice or mature prior to the end of an amortized term 
loans are generally sold with servicing released 
however  as of december   the bank was servicing  in loans for federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and  in loans for other investors 
the following table contains information  as of december   on the percentage of fixed rate single family loans serviced for others by the bank  by interest rate category 
coupon range percentage of portfolio less than over the bank s mortgage loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the viability of the loan  and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan 
the authority of the loan committee to approve loans is established by the board of directors and currently is commensurate with the bank s limitation on loans to one borrower 
the bank s maximum amount of loans to one borrower currently is equal to of the bank s unimpaired capital  or  as of december  loans greater than this amount require participation by one or more additional lenders 
letters of credit are subject to the same limitations as direct loans 
the bank utilizes independent qualified appraisers approved by the board of directors to appraise the properties securing its loans and requires title insurance or title opinions so as to insure that the bank has a valid lien on the mortgaged real estate 
the bank requires borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on its secured properties 
the procedure for approval of construction loans is the same for residential mortgage loans  except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans  construction specifications  and estimates of construction costs 
the bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer 
in addition  all construction loans generally require a commitment from a third party lender or from the bank for a permanent long term loan to replace the construction loan upon completion of construction 
commercial real estate loans at december   the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled  or of the bank s total loan portfolio 
all of the bank s commercial loans are secured by improved property such as office buildings  retail strip shopping centers  industrial condominium units and other small businesses most of which are located in the bank s primary lending area 
the largest commercial real estate loan outstanding at december  was a  loan secured by mobile home parks in hubert  north carolina and california  maryland and commercial land in california  maryland 
this loan has consistently performed in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument 
loans secured by commercial real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
construction loans the bank originates loans to finance the construction of one to four family dwellings  and to a lesser extent  commercial real estate 
it also originates loans for the acquisition and development of unimproved property to be used for residential and or commercial purposes in cases where the bank is to provide the construction funds to improve the properties 
as of december   the bank had construction loans outstanding in the gross aggregate amount of  representing of its loan portfolio  of which  was unadvanced 
construction loan amounts are based on the appraised value of the property and  for builder loans  a feasibility study as to the potential marketability and profitability of the project 
construction loans generally have terms of up to one year  with reasonable extensions as needed  and typically have interest rates that float monthly at margins typically ranging percent to percent above the prime rate 
in addition to builders projects  the bank finances the construction of single family  owner occupied houses where qualified contractors are involved and on the basis of strict written underwriting and construction loan guidelines 
construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans with the bank upon the expiration of the construction phase or to be paid off by financing from another financial institution 
construction loans afford the bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of its loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on loans secured by existing residential properties 
these higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction that is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to value accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the ultimate success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion  due to a default  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs 
in addition  the bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time 
the bank has attempted to address these risks through its underwriting procedures and its limited amount of construction lending on multi family and commercial real estate properties 
it is the policy of the bank to conduct physical inspections of each property secured by a construction or rehabilitation loan for the purpose of reporting upon the progress of the construction of improvements 
these inspections  referred to as construction draw inspections  are to be performed at the time of a request for an advance of construction funds 
if no construction advance has been requested  an inspection is made by a fee inspector or senior officer of the institution on the subject property at least quarterly 
multi family lending the bank occasionally originates multi family loans with terms up to years  but with rate adjustments or balloon payments generally at three to five years 
these loans are generally made in amounts up to of the appraised value of the secured property 
in making these loans  the bank bases its underwriting decision primarily on the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service  the financial resources and income level of the borrower  the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property  the marketability of the property and the bank s lending experience with the borrower 
the bank also typically receives a personal guarantee from the borrower 
as of december    or of the bank s total loan portfolio  consisted of multi family residential loans 
land and residential building lots land loans include loans to developers for the development of residential subdivisions and loans on unimproved lots primarily to individuals 
at december  the bank had outstanding land and residential building lot loans totaling  or of the bank s total loan portfolio 
the largest of these loans is for  is secured by residentially zoned land in ocean view  delaware  and has performed in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument 
land development loans typically are short term loans  the duration of these loans is typically not greater than three years 
the interest rate on land loans is generally at least or over the prime rate 
the loan to value ratio generally does not exceed 
loans typically are made to customers of the bank and developers and contractors with whom the bank has had previous lending experience 
in addition to the customary requirements for this type loan  the bank may also require a clean phase i environmental study and feasibility study to determine the profit potential of the development 
consumer and other loans the bank also offers other loans  primarily business and commercial loans 
these are loans to businesses not secured by real estate although they may be secured by equipment  securities  or other collateral 
they constitute a relatively small part of the bank s business  and typically are offered to customers with long standing relationships with the bank 
at december    or  of the loan portfolio consisted of business and commercial loans 
in addition  approximately of the loan portfolio is in consumer loans 
loan portfolio cash flows the following table sets forth the estimated maturity of the bank s loan portfolios by type of loan at december  the estimated maturity reflects contractual terms at december  contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of the bank s loan portfolios 
the average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due on sale clauses 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan rates substantially exceed rates on existing mortgage loans 
due due after within through due after one year years years total dollars in thousands one to four family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction and land acquisition and development loans land commercial  non real estate consumer total the following table contains certain information as of december  relating to the loan portfolio of the bank with the dollar amounts of loans due after one year that have fixed and floating rates

the second largest loan is in the amount of  and is secured by residentially zoned lots in ocean view  delaware 
the third largest loan is in the amount of  and is secured by various collateral including mobile home parks in california  maryland and hubert  north carolina 
all of these loans have fully performed since their inception 
origination and purchase and sale of loans the bank originates residential loans in conformity with standard underwriting criteria to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market 
although the bank has authority to lend anywhere in the united states  they have confined their loan origination activities to the states of maryland  virginia and delaware 
loan originations are developed from a number of sources  primarily from referrals from real estate brokers  builders  and existing and walk in customers 
severn savings also utilizes the services of loan brokers in its market area 
loan brokers are paid on a commission basis generally of the loan amount for loans brokered to the bank 
the bank s mortgage loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the viability of the loan  and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan 
the loan committee of the bank can approve residential and commercial loans ranging up to  the maximum amount of a loan to one borrower as of december  
the bank utilizes independent qualified appraisers approved by the board of directors to appraise the properties securing its loans and requires title insurance or title opinions so as to insure that the bank has a valid lien on the mortgaged real estate 
the bank requires borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on its secured properties 
the procedure for approval of construction loans is the same as for residential mortgage loans  except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans  construction specifications  and estimates of construction costs 
the bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer 
in addition  all construction loans generally require a commitment from a third party lender or from the bank for a permanent long term loan to replace the construction loan upon completion of construction 
consumer loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s credit history and an analysis of the borrower s income and expenses  ability to repay the loan  and the value of the collateral  if any 
currently  it is the bank s policy to originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans 
the bank is currently active in the secondary market and sells the majority of its fixed rate loan products 
interest rates  points and fees the bank realizes interest  point  and fee income from its lending activities 
the bank also realizes income from commitment fees for making commitments to originate loans  from prepayment and late charges  loan fees  application fees  and fees for other miscellaneous services 
the bank accounts for loan origination fees in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas on accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans sfas no 
issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
sfas no 
prohibits the immediate recognition of loan origination fees as revenues and requires that such income net of certain direct loan origination costs for each loan be amortized  generally by the interest method  over the estimated life of the loan as an adjustment of yield 
the bank also realizes income from gains on sales of loans  and servicing released fees for loans sold with servicing released 
delinquency and classified assets delinquencies the board of directors reviews delinquencies on all loans monthly 
the bank s collection procedures include sending a past due notice to the borrower on the th day of nonpayment  making telephone contact with the borrower between and days after nonpayment  and sending a letter after the th day of nonpayment 
a notice of intent to foreclose is sent between and days after delinquency 
when the borrower is contacted  the bank attempts to obtain full payment of the past due amount 
however  the bank generally will seek to reach agreement with the borrower on a payment plan to avoid foreclosure 
the bank categorizes its classified assets within four categories a special mention  b substandard  c doubtful and d loss 
special mention loans are days or more in arrears and include all borrowers who are in bankruptcy that have not missed any post petition payments 
the bank reserves on all special mention loans 
substandard loans are loans that are days or more delinquent and are loans that have borrowers in bankruptcy that have missed a post petition payment 
the bank reserves of substandard loans 
the doubtful category consists of loans where the bank expects a loss  but not a total loss 
various subjective factors are considered with the most important consideration being the estimated underlying value of the collateral 
the bank reserves of the amount of doubtful loans 
loans that are classified as loss are fully reserved 
all loans are individually evaluated if they are deemed classified 
the bank also evaluates all delinquent loans  individually 
the rest of the portfolio is evaluated as a group and a determination is made  periodically  concerning the inherent risks associated with particular types of loans and an allowance is assigned to those particular groups 
the bank allocates reserves to its allowance for loan losses in two ways 
where the bank has classified an asset it generally allocates the percentage of that asset under its classification system to a specific reserve if the asset is classified as doubtful or loss 
in cases where loans are classified as special mention or substandard the bank usually does not allocate its allowance for loan loss reserves to a specific reserve 
the bank does not allocate its allowance for loan losses based upon the unclassified portion of its loan portfolio to specific loan reserves 
it is the policy of the bank to discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan that is days or more past due 
the bank historically has not incurred any significant losses on delinquent mortgage loans 
the following table sets forth information as to non accrual loans 
the bank discontinues the accrual of interest on loans days or more past due  at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income 
as of the most recent reported period   would have been recorded for the year ended december  if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the year ended december  or since their origination if held for only part of the fiscal year 
for the year ended december    in interest income on such loans was actually included in net income 
at december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis mortgage loans one to four family real estate home equity lines of credit commercial land non mortgage loans consumer commercial loans total non accrual loans foreclosed real estate total non performing assets total non accrual loans to net loans allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans  including loans contractually past due days or more total non accrual and accruing loans greater than days past due to total assets total non performing assets to total assets classified assets and allowance for loan losses federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets  such as debt and equity securities  considered by the ots to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values 
assets classified as loss assets are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification in one of these categories but possess credit deficiencies or potential weakness are required to be designated special mention by management 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish general allowance for losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss assets  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to the full amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets is subject to scrutiny by the ots  which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank reviews monthly the assets in its portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
total classified loans as of december  were  allowance for loan losses as of december  was  which is of gross loans receivable and of total non performing loans

liquidity is the measure of a company s ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors and borrowers 
liquidity is provided by the ability to attract and retain deposits and by principal and interest payments on loans and maturing securities in the investment portfolio 
a strong core deposit base  supplemented by other deposits of varying maturities and rates  contributes to the bank s liquidity 
funds available through short term borrowings and asset maturities are considered adequate to meet all current needs  and management is continually monitoring the bank s liquidity position to meet projected needs 
interest rate sensitivity is maintaining the ability to reprice interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in relationship to changes in the general level of interest rates 
management attributes interest rate sensitivity to a steady net interest margin through all phases of interest rate cycles 
management attempts to make the necessary adjustments to constrain adverse savings in net interest income resulting from interest rate movements through gap analysis and income simulation modeling techniques

general savings and loan holding companies and savings associations are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and saif and not for the benefit of stockholders of bancorp 
the following information describes certain aspects of that regulation applicable to bancorp and the bank  and does not purport to be complete 
the discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to all particular statutory or regulatory provisions 
regulation of bancorp general 
bancorp is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulatory oversight by the ots 
as such  bancorp is required to register and file reports with the ots and is subject to regulation and examination by the ots 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over bancorp and its subsidiaries  which also permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings association 
activities restriction test 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  bancorp generally is not subject to activity restrictions  provided the bank satisfies the qualified thrift lender qtl test or meets the definition of domestic building and loan association pursuant to the code 
bancorp presently intends to continue to operate as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
recent legislation terminated the unitary thrift holding company exemption for all companies that apply to acquire savings associations after may  since bancorp is grandfathered  its unitary holding company powers and authorities were not affected 
see regulation of bancorp financial modernization legislation 
however  if bancorp acquires control of another savings association as a separate subsidiary  it would become a multiple savings and loan holding company  and the activities of bancorp and any of its subsidiaries other than the bank or any other saif insured savings association would become subject to restrictions applicable to bank holding companies unless such other associations each also qualify as a qtl or domestic building and loan association and were acquired in a supervisory acquisition 
furthermore  if bancorp were in the future to sell control of the bank to any other company  such company would not succeed to bancorp grandfathered status under and would be subject to the same business activity restrictions 
see regulation of the bank qualified thrift lender test 
restrictions on acquisitions 
bancorp must obtain approval from the ots before acquiring control of any other saif insured association 
such acquisitions are generally prohibited if they result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state 
however  such interstate acquisitions are permitted based on specific state authorization or in a supervisory acquisition of a failing savings association 
federal law generally provides that no person  acting directly or indirectly or through or in concert with one or more other persons  may acquire control  as that term is defined in ots regulations  of a federally insured savings association without giving at least days written notice to the ots and providing the ots an opportunity to disapprove the proposed acquisition 
in addition  no company may acquire control of such an institution without prior ots approval 
these provisions also prohibit  among other things  any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company  or any individual who owns or controls more than of the voting shares of a savings and loan holding company  from acquiring control of any savings association not a subsidiary of the savings and loan holding company  unless the acquisition is approved by the ots 
for additional restrictions on the acquisition of a unitary thrift holding company  see regulation of bancorp financial services modernization legislation

the sarbanes oxley act represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance  accounting obligations and corporate reporting 
the sarbanes oxley act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered or that file reports under the securities exchange act of in particular  the sarbanes oxley act established i new requirements for audit committees  including independence  expertise and responsibilities  ii additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company  iii new standards for auditors and regulation of audits  iv increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers  and v new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws 
many of the provisions were effective immediately while other provisions became effective over a period of time and are subject to rulemaking by the sec 
because bancorp s common stock is registered with the sec  it is currently subject to this act 
throughout and  the sec and nasdaq stock market issued new regulations affecting bancorp s corporate governance and heightening its disclosure requirements 
among the many new changes are enhanced proxy statement disclosures on corporate governance  stricter independence requirements for the board of directors and its committees  and posting of various sec reports on our website 
the full impact of the sarbanes oxley act is still uncertain and evolving  however the new legislation and implementing regulations have resulted in increased costs of compliance  including certain outside professional costs 
we cannot predict what legislation might be enacted or what regulations might be adopted  or if enacted or adopted  the effect thereof on our operations

financial services modernization legislation general 
in november  the gramm leach bliley act of the glb was enacted 
as a result of glb new opportunities became available to financial institution holding companies as it removed the restrictions that resulted from a regulatory framework that had its origin in the great depression of the s 
in addition  the glb also contains provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of glb is to permit banks  other depository institutions  insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that result in a single financial services organization to offer customers a wider array of financial services and products  through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but other activities incidental to such financial activities or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the glb also permits national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of financial subsidiaries 
a national bank may have a subsidiary engaged in any activity authorized for national banks directly or any financial activity  except for insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development  or merchant banking  which may only be conducted through a subsidiary of a financial holding company 
financial activities include all activities permitted under new sections of the bank holding company act or permitted by regulation 
to the extent that the glb permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the glb is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis and which unitary savings and loan holding companies already possess 
nevertheless  the glb may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that bancorp and the bank faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than bancorp and the bank 
regulation of the bank general 
as a federally chartered  saif insured savings association  the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the frb 
the ots  in conjunction with the fdic  regularly examines the bank and prepares reports for the consideration of the bank s board of directors on any deficiencies found in the operations of the bank 
the relationship between the bank and depositors and borrowers is also regulated by federal and state laws  especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents utilized by the bank 
the bank must file reports with the ots and the fdic concerning its activities and financial condition  in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the saif and depositors 
the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such regulations  whether by the ots  the fdic or the congress could have a material adverse impact on bancorp  the bank  and their operations 
privacy 
federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
since glb s enactment  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
the bank has implemented its privacy policies in accordance with the law 
interagency guidance on response programs to protect against identity theft on august   the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies requested public comment on proposed guidance that would require financial institutions to develop programs to respond to incidents of unauthorized access to customer information  including procedures for notifying customers under certain circumstances 
the proposed guidance interprets previously issued interagency customer information security guidelines that require financial institutions to implement information security programs designed to protect their customers information  and describes the components of a response program and sets a standard for providing notice to customers affected by unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to those customers  thereby reducing the risk of losses due to fraud or identity theft 
we are not able at this time to determine the impact of any such proposed guidance on our financial condition or results of operation 
premiums for deposit insurance through the bank insurance fund bif  the fdic insures our customer deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors 
specifically  the assessment rate is based on the institution s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category 
an institution s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
an institution s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 
fdic insured depository institutions pay an assessment rate equal to the rate assessed on deposits insured by saif 
the assessment rate currently ranges from zero to cents per of domestic deposits 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis 
due to continued growth in deposits and some recent bank failures  the bif is nearing its minimum reserve ratio of of insured deposits as mandated by law ratio of net worth of the bif to the value of the aggregate domestic deposits held in all bif members 
as of december   the bif reserve ratio was 
if the ratio drops below  it is likely the fdic will be required to assess premiums on all banks 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the company s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  depending on the collective size of the particular institutions involved 
all fdic insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  commonly referred to as fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the fdic established the fico assessment rates effective for the first half of at approximately cents for each of assessable deposits 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fdic s insurance funds and do not vary depending on a depository institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
regulatory capital requirements 
the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk federal banking agencies  to for assets with relatively high credit risk 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risk 
under the capital guidelines  a banking organization s total capital is divided into tiers 
tier i capital consists of common equity  qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries including trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
not more than of qualifying tier i capital may consist of trust preferred securities 
tier ii capital consists of hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities  a limited amount of subordinated debt  preferred stock that does not qualify as tier i capital  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
the guidelines require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
the bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement

the home owners loan act hola permits savings associations not in compliance with the ots capital standards to seek an exemption from certain penalties or sanctions for noncompliance 
such an exemption will be granted only if certain strict requirements are met  and must be denied under certain circumstances 
if an exemption is granted by the ots  the savings association still may be subject to enforcement actions for other violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices or conditions 
predatory lending 
the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
on october   frb regulations aimed at curbing such lending became effective 
the rule significantly widens the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following triggers coverage under the act interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable us treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above us treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulations bar loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the bank is unable at this time to determine the impact of these rule changes and potential state action in this area on its financial condition or results of operation 
prompt corrective action 
the prompt corrective action regulation of the ots  requires certain mandatory actions and authorizes certain other discretionary actions to be taken by the ots against a savings association that falls within certain undercapitalized capital categories specified in the regulation 
the regulation establishes five categories of capital classification well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulation  the risk based capital  leverage capital  and tangible capital ratios are used to determine an institution s capital classification 
at december   the bank met the capital requirements of a well capitalized institution under applicable ots regulations 
in general  the prompt corrective action regulation prohibits an insured depository institution from declaring any dividends  making any other capital distribution  or paying a management fee to a controlling person if  following the distribution or payment  the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories 
in addition  adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits only with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew  or roll over brokered deposits 
if the ots determines that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition  or if the institution is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice  the ots may  if the institution is well capitalized  reclassify it as adequately capitalized  if the institution is adequately capitalized but not well capitalized  require it to comply with restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions  and  if the institution is undercapitalized  require it to comply with certain restrictions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions 
finally  pursuant to an interagency agreement  the fdic can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution s primary regulator 
loans to one borrower limitations 
savings associations generally are subject to the lending limits applicable to national banks 
with certain limited exceptions  the maximum amount that a savings association or a national bank may lend to any borrower including certain related entities of the borrower at one time may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution  plus an additional of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
savings associations are additionally authorized to make loans to one borrower  for any purpose  in an amount not to exceed  or  by order of the director of the ots  in an amount not to exceed the lesser of  or of unimpaired capital and surplus to develop residential housing  provided the purchase price of each single family dwelling in the development does not exceed  the savings association is in compliance with its fully phased in capital requirements  the loans comply with applicable loan to value requirements  and the aggregate amount of loans made under this authority does not exceed of unimpaired capital and surplus 
at december   the bank s loans to one borrower limit was  based upon the of unimpaired capital and surplus measurement 
at december   the bank s largest single lending relationship had an outstanding balance of  and consisted of a loan secured by assignments of notes  deeds of trust  pledged stock and certificates of deposit 
the loan was performing in accordance with its terms 
qualified thrift lender test 
savings associations must meet a qtl test  which test may be met either by maintaining a specified level of assets in qualified thrift investments as specified in hola or by meeting the definition of a domestic building and loan association as defined in the code 
qualified thrift investments are primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage related securities 
the required percentage of investments under hola is of assets while the code requires investments of of assets 
an association must be in compliance with the qtl test or the definition of domestic building and loan association on a monthly basis in nine out of every months 
associations that fail to meet the qtl test will generally be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permitted for both a national bank and a savings association 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with its qtl requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan association 
affiliate transactions 
transactions between a savings association and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act and regulations adopted by the federal reserve 
affiliates of a savings association include  among other entities  the savings association s holding company and companies that are under common control with the savings association 
in general  a savings association or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in covered transactions with affiliates to an amount equal to of the association s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate  and to an amount equal to of the association s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates 
in addition  a savings association and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the savings association or its subsidiary  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
a covered transaction includes a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate  a purchase of investment securities issued by an affiliate  a purchase of assets from an affiliate  with some exceptions  the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party  or the issuance of a guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate 
in addition  under the ots regulations a savings association may not make a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate unless the affiliate is engaged only in activities permissible for bank holding companies  a savings association may not purchase or invest in securities of an affiliate other than shares of a subsidiary  a savings association and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low quality asset from an affiliate  covered transactions and other specified transactions between a savings association or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and with some exceptions  each loan or extension of credit by a savings association to an affiliate must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from to  depending on the type of collateral  of the amount of the loan or extension of credit 
regulations generally exclude all non bank and non savings association subsidiaries of savings associations from treatment as affiliates  except for a financial subsidiary  a subsidiary controlled by one or more affiliates  an esop  or a subsidiary determined by the ots or the federal reserve to be an affiliate 
the regulations also require savings associations to make and retain records that reflect affiliate transactions in reasonable detail and provides that specified classes of savings associations may be required to give the ots prior notice of affiliate transactions 
some of the entities included in the definition of an affiliate are parent companies  sister banks  sponsored and advised companies  investment companies whereby the bank its affiliate serves as investment advisor  and financial subsidiaries of the bank 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on us under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
see prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
capital distribution limitations 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations  like cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital 
the ots regulations require a savings association to file an application if it is not eligible for expedited treatment of its other applications under ots regulations  the total amount of all of capital distributions  including the proposed capital distribution  for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years  it would not be at least adequately capitalized  under the prompt corrective action regulations of the ots following the distribution  or the association s proposed capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute  regulation  or agreement between the savings association and the ots  or the fdic  or violate a condition imposed on the savings association in an ots approved application or notice 
in addition  a savings association must give the ots notice of a capital distribution if the savings association is not required to file an application  but would not be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the ots following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of the savings association s common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments like notes or debentures included in capital  other than regular payments required under a debt instrument approved by the ots  or the savings association is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company 
if neither the savings association nor the proposed capital distribution meets any of the above listed criteria  the ots does not require the savings association to submit an application or give notice when making the proposed capital distribution 
the ots may prohibit a proposed capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted if the ots determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
interstate banking and branching 
a federal savings association has the ability to establish branches outside its home state 
commercial banks can also branch across state lines  subject to any state law limitations or prohibitions 
competition may increase further as banks branch across state lines and enter new markets 
community reinvestment act and the fair lending laws 
savings associations have a responsibility under the community reinvestment act and related regulations of the ots to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
an institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the community reinvestment act could  at a minimum  result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications 
in addition  an institution s failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in the ots  other federal regulatory agencies as well as the department of justice taking enforcement actions 
based on an examination conducted july  the bank received a satisfactory rating 
effective january   the ots raised the dollar amount limit in the definition of small business loans from  to million  if used for commercial  corporate  business or agricultural purposes 
furthermore  the rule raises the aggregate level that a thrift can invest directly in community development funds  community centers and economic development initiatives in its communities from the greater of a quarter of one percent of total capital or  to one percent of total capital or  federal home loan bank system

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which are set forth on pages f through f of these significant accounting policies  the company considers the policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations 
the company has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
the company s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
overview the primary business of bancorp is mortgage lending 
the markets in which bancorp operates  anne arundel county  maryland  as well as surrounding areas in maryland  northern virginia and delaware  have enjoyed strong real estate demand 
this has fueled bancorp s growth  along with the demand to refinance existing mortgages as a result of historically low interest rates 
refinancing activity began to slow down toward the end of  and slowed considerably in however  with interest rates remaining low  construction lending and purchase money mortgage lending have continued to be extremely active 
bancorp has been able to take advantage of the continued low interest rate environment and had maintained a low cost of liabilities 
interest rates paid on deposits have remained low  as have interest rates paid for borrowing funds from the fhlb atlanta 
the difference between bancorp s costs of funds and what it earns on mortgage loans is the interest rate spread 
this spread has increased as bancorp s growing portfolio of mortgage loans coupled with the fees earned on loans sold in the secondary market  has driven up overall revenues 
while variable expenses  such as compensation  have increased  bancorp s overall expenses have remained modest  which has resulted in increasing profitability 
bancorp s asset quality has remained excellent  as there have been minimal losses due to defaulting loans 
going forward  bancorp s challenge will be to continue to grow assets in the form of mortgage loans  while earning a profitable spread  and continuing to maintain good asset quality 
interest rates are outside the control of bancorp  so it must attempt to balance its pricing and duration of its loan portfolio against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
the continued success and attraction of anne arundel county  maryland  and vicinity  will also be important to bancorp s ability to originate and grow its mortgage loans  as will bancorp s continued focus on maintaining a low overhead

the company is now in the process of reconciling these accounts which involve a discrepancy in the amount of approximately  at december  management expects to have the accounts reconciled by the end of the first quarter reporting period ending on march  it is anticipated that any required adjustments  charges or reserves will be taken during this period 
management does not believe that the required adjustments  if any  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
management has implemented additional controls over this process since year end to correct this deficiency  including requiring reconciliation of such accounts on a daily basis

this increase was primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio which offset a decrease in the company s interest rate spread of 
to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the company s interest rate spread decreased over the past year because interest rates earned on the bank s loans have fallen faster than the interest rates paid on the bank s interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses 
the bank s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
credit risk includes  but is not limited to  the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan 
the bank monitors its loan portfolio at least as often as quarterly and its loan delinquencies at least as often as monthly 
all loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the bank s portfolio as a group are evaluated 
the bank s board  with the advice and recommendation of the bank s delinquency committee  estimates an allowance to be set aside for loan losses 
included in determining the calculation are such factors as the inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy  economic trends  consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectibility 
an increase in the loan loss provision from the beginning of the year to the end of a year is the result after an analysis of the aforementioned factors and applying that rationale to the total portfolio 
the greater the construction  commercial and higher loan to value loans that are contained in the portfolio  the greater will be the allowance for loan losses 
changes in estimation methods may take place based upon the status of the economy and the estimate of the value of collateral and  as a result  the allowance may increase or decrease 
the bank believes that some portions of its loan portfolio have greater actual risk and  in other areas  there is greater inherent risk 
the loan loss allowance has increased when the board believes trends are negative and contributions to the allowance have decreased when trends are more positive 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
as of december   the total allowance for loan losses was  as compared to  as of december   which is an increase of  or 
the increase was a result of the current year s addition to the allowance and minimal charge offs being incurred 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was a result of increased loan growth and management s determination that adding to the provision for loan losses was  more or less appropriate for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio as compared to the year ended december  other income and non interest expense

additionally  loan payments  maturities  deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements 
in addition to its ability to generate deposits  bancorp has external sources of funds which may be drawn upon when desired 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit equal to of the bank s assets with fhlb atlanta 
the available line of credit with fhlb atlanta was  at december   of which  was outstanding at that time 
in assessing its liquidity the management of bancorp considers operating requirements  anticipated deposit flows  expected funding of loans  deposit maturities and borrowing availability  so that sufficient funds may be available on short notice to meet obligations and business opportunities as they arise 
in addition  management expects to incur an additional  before interior fit out  for construction costs associated with its new headquarters 
construction is expected to be completed in february as of december  bancorp had  outstanding in loan commitments  which bancorp expects to fund from the sources of liquidity described above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative information about market risk 
the principal objective of bancorp s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risks appropriate given bancorp s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with bancorp s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  bancorp seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of bancorp is responsible for reviewing assets liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis and  in connection with this review  evaluates bancorp s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on bancorp s net interest margin and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on bancorp s loan portfolio 
while continuous movement of interest rates is certain  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movement in interest rates has an effect on bancorp s profitability 
bancorp faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
bancorp s interest rate spread and interest rate margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though bancorp generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
bancorp s interest rate margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
bancorp s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all long term fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan servicing portfolio  bancorp originates a substantial amount of construction loans that typically have terms of one year or less 
the turnover in construction loan portfolio assists bancorp in maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing bancorp is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise prospective  bancorp manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination activities with the interest rate market 
bancorp attempts to maintain a substantial portion of its loan portfolio in short term loans such as construction loans 
this has proven to be an effective hedge against rapid increases in interest rates as the construction loan portfolio reprices rapidly 
the matching of maturity or repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an interest earning asset or interest bearing liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities represents the bank s interest sensitivity gap 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by bancorp s management 
its objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a board range of potential interest rate environments 
bancorp uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the following table represents bancorp s npv at december  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon information provided to the ots 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars are in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp risk measures for a given rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as of pv of assets post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure decline in npv ratio bp bp bp tb a level of risk minimal minimal minimal note calculations of using cmr data edited cmr report filing is required 
for this quarter  the sensitivity measure is defined as the decline in the pre shock npv ratio caused by a basis point decrease of a basis point increase in interest rates  whichever produces the larger decline 
due to the abnormally low prevailing interest rate environment  this report no longer provides npv estimates for changes in interest rates of or greater
