the following discussion may contain forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward looking statements 
some factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward looking statements are described in item business risk factors 
overview we market fuel and related services to marine and aviation customers throughout the world 
in our marine fuel services business  we offer marine fuel and related services to a broad base of customers  including international container and tanker fleets  and time charter operators  as well as to the united states and foreign governments 
in our aviation fuel services business  we offer aviation fuel and related services to passenger  cargo and charter airlines  as well as to corporate customers and the united states and foreign governments 
we provide competitive prices  credit terms  fuel management and price risk management services  and single supplier convenience 
we also offer flight plans and weather reports to our corporate aviation customers 
in our marine fuel services business  we purchase and resell fuel  and act as brokers for others 
profit from our marine fuel services business is determined primarily by the volume and commission rate of brokering business generated and by the volume and gross profit achieved on fuel resales 
our profitability also depends on our operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debts 
profit from our aviation fuel services business is directly related to the volume and the gross profit achieved on fuel sales  as well as our operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debts 
we do not act as brokers for our aviation fuel services business 
in january and april  we acquired the operations of the oil shipping group of companies and tramp oil  respectively 
these acquisitions form part of our worldwide marine fuel services business and were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquisitions were included with our results since their respective dates of acquisition 
in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement with signature flight support corporation through the acquisition of a equity interest in pafco 
from january  to december   we used the equity method of accounting to record our share of the earnings and losses of this aviation joint venture 
in addition  the amortized interest expense on the non interest bearing promissory note was also included in net earnings from this aviation joint venture 
effective january   with the implementation of fin no 
 we consolidated pafco s financial position and results of operations  after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts  transactions and profits 
restatement we have restated our previously reported consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  the nine months ended december   and the year ended march  the restatement reflects the correction of the cutoff procedures used by the company for recognizing sales and sales related costs 
under the corrected cutoff procedures  revenues and sales related costs are recognized at the time fuel deliveries are made and related services are performed 
because we contract with third parties for fuel deliveries and the performance of the related services  this causes delays in our receiving the necessary information for invoicing 
as a result of these delays  the company had historically recorded revenue and sales related costs when supporting documentation relating to fuel deliveries and related services had been received from third parties 
reportable segments we have two reportable operating businesses marine and aviation fuel services 
corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage  where possible  or on other factors according to the nature of the activity 
financial information with respect to our business segments is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
page of 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenue and related costs of sales  bad debts  deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when fuel deliveries are made and title passes to the customer  or as fuel related services are performed 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for bad debts credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed by each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits above certain amounts  setting and maintaining credit standards  and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to many of our customers 
accounts receivable are deemed past due based on contractual terms agreed with our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market and industry conditions of our customers  and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts and notes receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we had accounts and notes receivable of million and million  net of allowance for bad debts of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
accounts and notes receivable are written off when it becomes apparent based upon age or customer circumstances that such amounts will not be collected 
we believe the level of our allowance for bad debts is reasonable based on our experience and our analysis of the net realizable value of our trade receivables at december  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past  since adverse changes in the marine and aviation industries  or changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers  could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable and our future operating results 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see risk factors in item of this form k 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents our cost in excess of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of the acquired companies and the pafco aviation joint venture 
the identifiable intangible assets for customer relations existing at the date the acquisitions were recorded and are being amortized over their useful lives of five to seven years 
we account for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other provisions  sfas no 
states that goodwill shall not be amortized prospectively 
we recorded amortization of our identifiable intangible assets of million for the year ended december   thousand for the years ended december  and  and thousand for the nine months ended december  page of 
table of contents the future estimated amortization of our identifiable intangible assets is as follows in thousands for the year ending december  thereafter in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
based on results of these comparisons as of december   goodwill in each of our reporting units is not considered impaired 
accordingly  no impairment charges were recognized 
income taxes income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
as of december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance 
results of operations overview our profitability improved in due to increases both in metric tons of fuel sold in marine and in gallons of fuel sold in aviation  and a decrease in the provision for bad debts 
earnings were adversely affected by decreases in both the gross profit per metric ton sold in marine and gross profit per gallon sold in aviation  by increases in salaries and wages and in other operating expenses  and by the effect of non operating expenses recorded in versus non operating income recorded in the increase in marine business volume in was primarily due to the tramp oil acquisition and additional sales to new and existing customers 
the decrease in gross profit per metric ton sold in marine in reflects sustained high marine fuel prices  competitive pressures  and the acquisition of lower margin business from tramp oil 
the increase in sales volume and the decrease in gross profit per gallon in the aviation business in were primarily due to growth in our fuel management business  which is a higher credit quality  lower margin business  as well as new commercial business 
the decrease in the provision for bad debts in was primarily due to a shift of business in favor of higher credit quality  high volume commercial business as well as the recording of bad debt expenses in relating to the write off of receivables from two international airlines that filed for bankruptcy 
the increases in salaries and wages and other operating expenses in were due to the additional operating costs of tramp oil as well as higher overall operating costs associated with increased business activities 
negative changes in non operating items in were primarily due to the recognition of exchange losses relating to the conversion into us dollars of foreign currencies acquired in connection with the tramp oil acquisition and higher interest expense associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we may experience decreases in future sales volume and margins as a result of deterioration in the world economy  or in the shipping or aviation industries  and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  because fuel costs represent a significant part of a vessel s and airline s operating expenses  volatile and or high fuel prices can adversely affect our customers businesses  and consequently the demand for our services  and our results of operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in our marine and aviation fuel services businesses  our primary use of cash is to fund fuel purchases relating to sales of fuel to our customers 
cash is also used to maintain aviation and marine fuel inventory for sale to customers 
we are usually extended unsecured trade credit from our suppliers for our fuel purchases  however  certain suppliers require us to provide a letter of credit 
our ability to fund fuel purchases  obtain trade credit from our suppliers  and provide letters of credit is critical to our business 
increases in oil prices negatively affect liquidity by increasing the amount of cash needed to fund fuel purchases as well as reducing the amount of fuel which can be purchased on an unsecured credit basis from our suppliers 
historically  we have not required significant capital investment in fixed assets for our businesses as we subcontract fueling services and maintain inventory at third party storage facilities 
our business is funded through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our syndicated revolving credit facility 
we have a syndicated revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to million with a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million and our issued letters of credit totaled million 
the credit agreement relating to the revolving credit facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us 
our failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement  and impair our ability to receive advances and issue letters of credit  and thus have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund operations 
currently  we are in compliance with all material obligations under the credit agreement 
in april  we obtained a separate million credit line for the issuance of letters of credit from one of the banks participating in our syndicated revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million under this credit line  in addition to the letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
higher interest rates can have a negative effect on our liquidity due to higher costs of borrowing under our million syndicated revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million of cash and cash equivalents at december  our cash position can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of payments to suppliers and receipt of payments from customers 
net cash used in continuing operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  versus net cash provided by continuing operating activities of million for the year ended december  this million variance was primarily due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of increased business activities and higher fuel prices in both our aviation and marine segments 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million versus net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this million variance resulted from a reduction in capital expenditures of thousand and net cash received as a result of the acquisition of tramp oil 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included herein  for additional information 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million versus net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  this million variance was primarily due to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of in and an increase in the proceeds from exercises of stock options of million  offset by the repayment of assumed bank loans and bank overdrafts from tramp oil of million

as of december   prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million primarily due to the acquisition of tramp oil  increased business activities  and increased mark to market of our outstanding derivatives at year end 
our current liabilities  other than short term debt  increased million primarily due to increased business activities in our marine and aviation segments as well as the acquisition of tramp oil 
long term and short term debt increased by million  primarily due to net borrowings of million under our syndicated revolving credit facility  partially offset by the repayment of our acquisition debts

our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to obtain financing are based on currently available information 
to the extent this information proves to be inaccurate  or if circumstances change  future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity would be adversely affected 
factors that may affect the availability of trade credit  or other financing  include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities  the state of worldwide credit markets  and our levels of outstanding debt

table of contents american jobs creation act of in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act of the act  signed into law on october   provides for a special one time tax deduction  or dividend received deduction drd  of of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date 
fsp no 
provides entities additional time to assess the effect of repatriating foreign earnings under the act for purposes of applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which typically requires the effect of a new tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment 
the company will elect  if applicable  to apply the drd to qualifying dividends of foreign earnings in its fiscal year ending december the company is awaiting further clarifying guidance from the us treasury department on certain provisions of the act 
once this guidance is received  the company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the act during under the limitations on the amount of dividends qualifying for the drd of the act  the maximum repatriation of the company s foreign earnings that may qualify for the special one time drd is approximately million 
therefore  the range of possible amounts of qualifying dividends of foreign earnings is between zero and approximately million 
because the evaluation is ongoing  it is not yet practical to estimate a range of possible income tax effects of potential repatriations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we enter into derivative contracts in the form of swaps and futures in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine and aviation fuel 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge under sfas no 
or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the derivative are either recognized in income along with the corresponding change in fair value of the item being hedged for fair value hedges or deferred in other comprehensive income oci to the extent the hedge is effective for cash flow hedges 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
we measure hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
for the periods reported  such ineffectiveness has been immaterial 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when a hedging instrument becomes ineffective 
we assess hedge effectiveness based on total changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 
gains and losses deferred in accumulated oci related to cash flow hedge derivatives that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related fuel is delivered 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective 
the balance in the fair value hedge adjustment account is recognized in income when the hedged item is sold 
if we determine that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the related hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
gains and losses on hedging instruments and adjustments of the carrying amounts of hedged items are included in revenues and expenses in the period that the item is sold 
gains and losses on hedging instruments which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in revenue in the period which they occur 
the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activities 
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used by us to mitigate the risk of variability in cash flows from marine and aviation fuel sales and purchases due to changes in market prices 
fair value derivatives are used by us to offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of our inventory 
cash flow hedges as of december   our cash flow hedges consisted of fixed price sales commitments an all in one hedge and fixed price swaps 
the fixed price sales commitments are used to fix the prices of future fuel sales  while the fixed price swap agreements are used to fix the prices of anticipated future fuel purchases 
accordingly  changes in fair value of these derivatives fully offset in oci and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and related accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
page of 
table of contents fair value derivatives as of december   our fair value derivatives consisted of positions in futures that are used to offset against changes in the fair value of our inventory 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in revenue and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
non designated derivatives as of december   our non designated derivatives consisted of swap contracts with our customers and swap and collar contracts with counterparties 
as part of our price risk management services  we offer swap contracts to our customers to fix their fuel prices and simultaneously we enter into a swap contract with a counterparty with substantially the same terms and conditions  and for this  we earn a fee 
we recognize the fee revenue when both of the swap contracts are settled 
because these contracts are back to back transactions  changes in the fair value of these derivatives have no impact on earnings and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and related accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
as of december  we had the following commodity related derivative instruments outstanding with average underlying prices that represent hedged prices of commodities at various market locations in thousands settlement period derivative instrument hedge strategy notional amount average underlying prices fair value asset liability marine metric tons aviation gallons in thousands swap sales commitments sales commitments swap swap swap swap swap swap swap swap swap futures futures cash flow cash flow cash flow cash flow non designated non designated non designated non designated non designated non designated non designated non designated fair value fair value swap swap swap swap non designated non designated non designated non designated swap swap non designated non designated our policy is to not use fuel related derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

we conduct the vast majority of our business transactions in us dollars 
however  in certain markets  such as mexico  colombia and the united kingdom  payments to some of our fuel suppliers and receipts from some of our customers are denominated in local currency 
this subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations through our regular operating and financing activities
