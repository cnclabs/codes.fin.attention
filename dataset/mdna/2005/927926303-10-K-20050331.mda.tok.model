overview vista gold is engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects with the aim of adding value to the projects 
the corporation s approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material 
in addition  the corporation looks for opportunities to improve the value of its gold projects through exploration drilling or introducing technological innovations 
the corporation expects that emphasis on gold project acquisition and improvement will continue in the future 
the corporation s holdings include the maverick springs  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills and wildcat projects and the hycroft mine  all in nevada  the long valley project in east central california  the yellow pine project in idaho  the paredones amarillos and the guadalupe de los reyes projects in mexico  and the amayapampa project in bolivia 
the corporation also owns several exploration claims in canada and approximately of the shares of zamora gold corp  a company exploring for gold in ecuador 
outlook gold prices started at per ounce and finished the year at per ounce 
at the end of  the corporation owned or controlled eleven properties containing mineralized material 
the corporation expects that emphasis on gold project acquisition will continue in the future 
in addition  through exploration drilling and engineering studies  management believes that additional value can be added to most of the projects by advancing them closer to a production decision 
the corporation does not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices  management expects to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
the corporation may generate revenues and cash flows from its portfolio of gold projects by several means  including but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties  or project development and operation 
with respect to the corporation s current property holdings  aggregate expenditures for purchase installments  to maintain options and conduct exploration activities are currently anticipated to be approximately  in and  in at present  the corporation would anticipate raising funds to meet these long term obligations through equity private placements  or joint venture efforts or sale of properties currently controlled 
in subsequent years  the corporation anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital to meet property purchase installment obligations and scheduled payments on those properties that the corporation decides to retain under option 
further  additional capital would be necessary to acquire properties and conduct exploration drilling and re engineering studies on current and newly acquired properties 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will be successful in efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary the corporation s consolidated net loss was million or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of million or per share for a net increase of million 
the increase of million in is due to increased holding costs at the hycroft mine of million  decreased holding costs at the amayapampa property of million  increased property exploration costs of million  increased general and administrative costs of million  and increased stock based compensation of million 
as compared to a consolidated net loss of million or per share in  the consolidated net loss decreased by million 
the improvement in includes a non recurring charge of million for a reclamation obligation increase  offset by increased holding costs at the hycroft mine of million  increased holding costs at the amayapampa property of million  increased general and administrative costs of million  increased investor relations costs of million  and increased depreciation of million 
gold production and revenue the hycroft mine is on care and maintenance 
mining activities were suspended at hycroft in and  as expected  gold production has declined steadily since that time 
currently  solution is being circulated over the heap leach pads to enhance evaporation and extract gold through carbon stripping processes 
the extracted gold is then refined and sold 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine and reporting the associated sales proceeds as revenue was no longer warranted 
accordingly  gold sales proceeds of approximately nil in  million in and million in have been accounted for as an offset to exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
gold revenues in  and therefore were nil 
gold production costs  which are offset by proceeds received from gold sales of million in and million in  are no longer recorded as production costs  but are accounted for as exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
recorded  and production costs are therefore nil 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased approximately million from million in to million in exploration costs increased by million in the increase in net holding costs for the hycroft mine of approximately million primarily contributes to the overall increase noted 
actual holding costs for the hycroft mine did not in fact increase from the prior year  but rather  gold recovery from the heap leach pads decreased from resulting in the net increase in costs 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administrative and investor relations costs were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million 
this increase is the result of a more comprehensive investor relations program  the cost of which increased million from  and a million increase in general expenses and payroll costs with the addition of personnel and the use of consultants during the year 
corporate administration and investor relations costs were million in  slightly higher than the million in the increase reflects new investor relations and business development programs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million in both and depreciation and amortization costs at hycroft were million in compared to million in this increase is primarily the result of plant and equipment at the hycroft mine being depreciated in over the full year where depreciation was not calculated as a result of write downs to salvage value in prior years 
other income and expenses provisions for reclamation and mine closure costs during  the corporation increased its accrued mine closure costs by  for employee severance accruals 
with consideration given to this increase  the accrued reclamation obligation and mine closure costs at year end was million as compared to million in as previously noted  effective january   the corporation has adopted the new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations  cica management regularly reviews the fair value of reclamation obligation estimates where any increase in the fair value of the estimate will be recorded in the period in which the increase is incurred 
the application of this standard did not result in an increase in the reclamation obligations during the year consistent with the us bureau of land management  nevada state office mandated procedures in  the corporation commissioned a third party comprehensive review of the estimated reclamation costs at the hycroft mine 
based on this review  the corporation increased its accrued reclamation obligation by million in to million from million 
stock based compensation on january   the corporation retroactively adopted  without restatement of prior years  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  cica this standard requires that the corporation record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock option grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the adoption of the fair value method resulted in a cumulative increase of  to the opening deficit at january  and increases of  and  to common share capital and stock options  respectively  at january  previously the corporation recorded only those expenses associated with stock options granted to non employees based upon the fair value on the earlier date of completion of performance or vesting of the options granted

the final payment will be made at the earlier of the start of construction or june  this payment remains unchanged from the original agreement  as reported in december  in that luzon will pay vista  in cash or at vista s option  a combination of luzon common shares and cash based on luzon s share price 
when production commences  vista will also receive a net smelter type royalty on gold production at gold prices of per ounce or below and at gold prices above per ounce 
other terms of the agreement remain unchanged 
letter of intent to grant canyon resources an option to purchase hycroft mine in january  the corporation signed a binding letter of intent agreement with canyon resources corporation canyon to grant canyon a six month option to purchase the hycroft mine in nevada for an aggregate amount of million consisting of a combination of million in cash and million in equity units 
completion of the transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive option and purchase agreement and regulatory approval 
the agreement provides for canyon to expend  on a program of development and exploration drilling and mine engineering 
the objectives of this program are to evaluate and expand the oxide reserves of hycroft and to provide design information for the restart of oxide leaching operations 
at any time during the six month period  canyon may exercise its option to purchase hycroft for an aggregate amount of million consisting of a combination of million in cash and million in units  with each unit consisting of one share of canyon common stock and a warrant to purchase one half share of canyon common stock 
the number of units would be calculated by dividing million by the average closing price of canyon stock for the trading days prior to the exercise of the option

also included were an aggregate  common shares issued  as well as those to be issued on exercise of warrants  in connection with scheduled payments for certain property acquisitions of the corporation 
as a result of this registration statement becoming effective within six months following the closing of the private placement  the exercise price of the warrants remained at rather than being reduced to as would have been the case if the registration statement were declared effective after the six month period 
significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties and stock based compensation 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition and exploration costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project would be put into production  capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
management of the corporation regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices  proven and probable reserves  weighted probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  a write down to the estimated fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if carrying values can be recovered 
provision for future reclamation and closure costs on january   the corporation adopted the new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations  cica the standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the corporation s financial position or results 
stock based compensation and other stock based payments on january   the corporation retroactively adopted  without restatement of prior years  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  cica this standard requires that the corporation record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the adoption of the fair value method resulted in a cumulative increase of  to the opening deficit at january   and increases of  and  to common share capital and stock options  respectively  at january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation is engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities including exploration engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of the corporation s properties is related to gold price and changes in the price of gold could affect the corporation s ability to generate revenue from its portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for  and supply of  gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because the corporation has several exploration operations in north and south america  it is subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
the corporation does not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations as insignificant monetary amounts are held for immaterial land holding costs related to the properties owned 
the corporation has no debt outstanding  nor does it have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  the corporation considers its interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time
