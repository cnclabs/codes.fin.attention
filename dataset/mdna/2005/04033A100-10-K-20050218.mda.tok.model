item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of breakthrough medicines to treat disease by regulating cell signaling with small molecules 
breakthrough medicines are products  created de novo  that may be used to treat diseases in innovative ways 
our initial disease focus is cancer  and we are developing a comprehensive approach that addresses the greatest medical need novel therapies for aggressive and advanced stage disease for which current treatments are inadequate 
in oncology  our goal is to create a series of novel small molecule product candidates to provide targeted and highly potent anti cancer activity to treat both solid tumors and hematologic cancers  as well as the spread of primary tumors to distant sites 
medinol ltd 
is also developing stents to deliver our lead cancer product candidate to prevent reblockage at sites of vascular injury following stent assisted angioplasty 
we also have an exclusive license to pioneering technology and patents related to certain nf b cell signaling activity  which may be useful in treating certain diseases 
additionally  we have developed a proprietary portfolio of cell signaling regulation technologies  our argent technology  to control intracellular processes with small molecules  providing versatile tools for use in cell biology  functional genomics  proteomics and drug discovery research and useful in regulated protein and cell therapy 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and most of our revenue to date has been received in connection with our past relationship with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  which is now part of the sanofi aventis group 
except for the gain on the sale of our fifty percent interest in the hoechst ariad genomics center llc to aventis in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  including costs for clinical trials and product manufacturing  personnel and our intellectual property 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
general our operating losses are primarily due to the costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  personnel and intellectual property 
as our product development programs progress  we incur significant costs for toxicology and pharmacology studies  product development  manufacturing  clinical trials and regulatory support 
these costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of product candidates in development  the stage of development of each product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
costs associated with our intellectual property include legal fees and other costs to prosecute  maintain  protect and enforce our intellectual property  which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the status of patent issues being pursued 
because we currently receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and receive only limited license revenue  we have  most recently  relied primarily on the capital markets as our source of funding 
we also utilize long term debt to supplement our funding  particularly as a means to fund investment in property and equipment and infrastructure needs 
in addition  we may seek funding from collaborations with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and or medical device companies for development and commercialization of our product candidates 
these collaborations may take the form of licensing arrangements  co development or joint venture arrangements or other structures 
if funding from these various sources is unavailable on reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operating expenses in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  scaling back or eliminating one or more of our product development programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of deferred compensation benefits for executives and key employees  stock based compensation to consultants  and the carrying value of intangible assets 
in determining expense related to the deferred executive compensation plan and stock based compensation to consultants  recorded balances are adjusted at each reporting period to reflect fair value utilizing the black scholes option pricing model that takes into account  among other things  the price and volatility of our common stock or other underlying securities  a risk free discount rate  and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in those factors can result in uneven expense charges or credits to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the market prices of the underlying securities in our executive deferred compensation plan were higher at december   we would have recognized an additional  in compensation expense in similarly  if the price and volatility of our common stock were greater as of december   we would have recognized an increase of  in stock based compensation to consultants in at december   we reported million of intangible assets consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents or licenses 
changes in these lives or a decision to discontinue using the technologies could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
for example  during and  we expensed  and  respectively  of unamortized costs related to certain intangible assets which we are not actively pursuing any longer 
we have concluded that the carrying value of our remaining intangible assets is not currently impaired because such assets are utilized in our product development programs and or continue to be viable technologies for collaborations or licensing efforts which we continue to pursue 
if we were to abandon the underlying technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized license revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license revenue was due to license agreements into which we have entered during this period related to our nf b technology and our argent cell signaling regulation technology 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in the research and development process necessary to commercialize a pharmaceutical product is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the fda in an ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in an nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries  approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs are not tracked by product candidate because the number of product candidates and projects in r d may vary from time to time and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
our research and development expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs    preclinical programs    all other r d expenses    direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
ap  our lead product candidate which is in phase clinical trials  was our only clinical program in and direct external expenses for ap increased by million in versus due primarily to increases in clinical trial costs million and manufacturing related costs million 
in  we continued to manage our ongoing phase trials of ap  initiated additional phase trials and commenced enrollment of patients in phase trials 
the increase in clinical trial costs is directly related to the initiation of trials  increased enrollment  the costs of evaluating enrolled patients  the costs of managing the trials  laboratory costs and the costs of compiling and analyzing results obtained in the trials 
manufacturing costs include product and process development work  as well as the costs to produce drug product 
manufacturing costs for ap increased significantly in due to an increase in the quantities of drug product manufactured for the clinical trials and investments in manufacturing process development 
through december   we have incurred a total of approximately million in direct external expenses for ap as a clinical program 
we expect that our direct external costs for ap will increase in as we continue to expand our clinical trials on this product candidate and incur the related costs of manufacturing and other costs to support such trials 
preclinical programs consist primarily of our oncogenic kinase inhibitor program and our bone targeted mtor inhibitor program 
direct external expenses on preclinical programs will increase or decrease over time depending on the status and number of programs in this stage of development 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs increased by million in as compared to due to pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted by outside contract laboratories  particularly in the first half of  as well as product and process development efforts for these product candidates 
we expect that our direct external expenses for preclinical programs will increase in  as resources allow  as we strive to move preclinical candidates into clinical development 
all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to due to higher personnel and related costs million as a result of an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments  and miscellaneous increases in supplies  consulting fees  equipment maintenance costs and travel related expenses in support of our research and development programs 
increases in these expenses were partially offset by decreases in write offs of capitalized license and patent costs  and termination or buy out of equipment leases in 
we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in in support of our clinical and preclinical development programs 
the successful development of our products is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in risk factors 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our programs will commence are unavailable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in due primarily to costs related to our patent infringement litigation with eli lilly and company lilly and to business development and other corporate initiatives  including compliance with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in general and administrative expenses was also due to the awarding in january of restricted stock grants  in lieu of stock options  to our chief executive officer and each of the other members of our board of directors 
in  we recorded an expense of million related to these awards 
other increases in general and administrative expenses included salary adjustments  the cost of awards under our deferred executive compensation plan  and miscellaneous increases in insurance  state taxes and travel related expenses 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in as necessary to support our research and development programs and to continue to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect that our operating expenses in total will increase in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on the progress of our product development programs  including preclinical and clinical studies and product manufacturing  the status of our patent infringement litigation with lilly and our ability to raise funding through equity offerings  partnerships  licensing  joint ventures or other sources 
interest income expense interest income increased by to million in from  in  primarily as a result of a higher level of funds invested in interest expense decreased by to  in from  in  primarily as a result of lower average loan balances in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million  or 
we expect that our loss from operations will increase in due to the expected increases in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses described above 
losses may fluctuate depending on the extent to which  if at all  we enter into collaborations or partner s hips for one or more of our product candidates or licenses for our technologies 
the extent of operating losses will also depend on our ability to raise funds from other sources  such as the capital markets  which will influence the amount we will spend on research and development and the development timelines for our product candidates 
we reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or  and a net loss per share of and  respectively 
years ended december  and revenue we recognized license revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license revenue was due to license agreements into which we have entered during the period related to our nf b technology and our argent cell signaling regulation technology 
operating expenses research and development expenses our research and development expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs   preclinical programs    all other r d expenses    clinical programs consisted of ap  for which we filed an ind in the fourth quarter of direct external expenses for this product candidate consisted of costs associated with initiating clinical trials and enrolling and studying patients in these trials 
preclinical programs in and consisted primarily of our oncogenic kinase inhibitor program and our bone targeted mtor inhibitor program 
preclinical programs in also included the completion of the preclinical stage of development of ap direct external expenses for preclinical programs decreased by million in versus due to the completion of preclinical studies related to ap and due to our decision in early to focus our development efforts on our small molecule product candidates to treat cancer 
as a result  several other preclinical programs were scaled back in all other r d expenses decreased by million in versus primarily due to reduced personnel expenses  through a reduction in our workforce in march  and related decreases in laboratory and general expenses  reduced expenses related to equipment leases  due to expiration or buy out of most of such leases  and reduced amortization of leasehold improvements that have become fully amortized general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this  decrease was primarily due to decreases in consulting and other professional fees  and reductions in overhead and other expenses  as a result of efforts to conserve cash and capital  offset in part by increases in personnel costs  related to additions of certain personnel and increased insurance costs  reflective of general increases in premiums by insurance companies 
general and administrative expenses included fees and expenses of outside legal counsel of million in and million in related to securities  employment  real estate  general corporate and litigation matters  more than half of which was incurred each year in connection with our litigation with lilly 
interest income expense interest income decreased to  in from  in primarily as a result of declining interest rates during the year and a lower level of funds invested 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease was primarily due to a lower level of long term debt outstanding and lower interest rates in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  a decrease in loss of million  or 
this decrease in loss was attributable to decreased operating expenses as a result of our decision to focus our research and development efforts on our cancer small molecule product candidates 
we reported a net loss of million in or per share as compared to a net loss of million in or per share 
selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts quarters first second third fourth total license revenue net loss     net loss per share quarters first second third fourth total license revenue net loss     net loss per share liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  we raised funding from the following sources year ended december  in thousands sales issuances of common stock to institutional investors   pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans  increase decrease in long term debt  net    the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
during  we raised net proceeds of million in a private placement of our common stock 
in  with additional progress in the development of our product candidates and an increased focus on oncology  we successfully completed three private placements with institutional investors and realized net proceeds of million 
in  we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
the following table details our sales of common stock to institutional investors in  and number of shares net cash proceeds in thousands november per share   may per share   october per share   december per share   march per share   we have filed shelf registration statements with the united states securities and exchange commission sec  from time to time  to ensure that we have registered shares of our common stock available for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when terms are favorable 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock  which was declared effective on january  as of december   after selling  of these shares in our march offering  we have  shares available for issuance under this shelf registration 
we anticipate filing in early a new shelf registration with the sec under which we may register for sale additional shares of our common stock 
in march  we entered into a term loan agreement with a bank for million  the proceeds of which were used to repay existing long term debt  to pay off our obligations under certain operating leases for equipment and for general working capital purposes 
the loan is secured by all of our assets excluding intellectual property  which we have agreed not to pledge to any other party 
the loan carries interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
we amended the terms of the loan on december  and december   receiving another million and million  respectively  in loan proceeds 
the amended loan is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest beginning in january with a final payment of million due in march the terms of the loan require us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict additional indebtedness  additional liens  and sales of assets  and dividends  distributions or repurchases of common stock 
the balance outstanding as of december  was  uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to invest in intellectual property and property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities    investment in intangible assets  investment in property and equipment  the net cash used in operating activities is comprised of our net losses and working capital requirements 
as noted above  our net loss decreased in as we reduced our operating expenses to conserve cash and capital  and increased in due to the expansion of our clinical development program and related costs for ap and continued investment in our preclinical programs 
also as noted above  we expect that our loss from operations will increase in due to continued progress in clinical and preclinical development of our small molecule product candidates 
as a consequence  we expect that our net cash used in operations will increase in we expect that our investment in intangible assets  which primarily consist of patents and licenses that make up our intellectual property portfolio  will increase in our investment in property and equipment increased in as we commenced a renovation project to create more useable space in our facility and an upgrade to our information technology infrastructure 
these projects will be completed in we expect that our investment in property and equipment will increase in contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
these contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payments due by period total in through through after long term debt    operating leases  other long term obligations    long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of  our average interest rate on our debt of december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in and  in the period through other long term obligations are comprised primarily of employment agreements and license agreements 
the license agreements generally provide for payment by us of annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties upon successful commercialization of products 
all license agreements are cancelable by us 
the above table reflects remaining license fees for the lives of the agreements but excludes milestone and royalty payments  as such amounts are not probable or estimable at this time 
liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  based on our current operating plans and our known and anticipated contractual obligations and assuming no further funding or potential revenues that may be generated from product partnering or licensing initiatives we are currently pursuing  we believe that our currently available funds will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operating requirements into the fourth quarter of however  there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans or other future events affecting our operating expenses will not result in the depletion of our funds at an earlier time 
we will require substantial additional funding for our research and development programs  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or other arrangements with collaborative partner s  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
and superseded apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with grants of stock options and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements  effective as of the first reporting period that begins after june  compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instrument on the grant date and will be recognized over the vesting period 
this pronouncement applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for such transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the company 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
r as of july  and has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with purchases of shares of common stock by employees at a discount to market value under employee stock purchase plans that meet certain criteria 
the impact of this requirement on the company s consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements first in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government securities with maturities of three years or less  but not longer than the availability of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund projected needs for such funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
realized gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the short term nature of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds are invested solely in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities with maturities less than years  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
we have an executive compensation plan which provides participants  in lieu of a cash bonus  an option to purchase certain designated mutual funds at a discount 
these deferred compensation arrangements are accounted for as derivatives under sfas no 
the fair value of the derivatives is reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
as of december   in the event of a hypothetical increase decrease in the fair market value of the underlying mutual funds  we would incur approximately  of additional reduced compensation expense 
at december   we have a bank term note which bears interest at prime or libor 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the prime rate basis points  we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense in certain factors that may affect future results of operations the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions
