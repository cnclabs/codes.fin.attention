item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially and adversely from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview skyworks solutions  inc skyworks or the company is an industry leader in radio solutions and precision analog semiconductors servicing a diversified set of mobile communications customers 
our front end modules  radio solutions and multimode transceivers are at the heart of many of today s leading edge multimedia handsets and wireless networking platforms 
skyworks also offers a portfolio of highly innovative linear products  supporting a wide range of applications including automotive  broadband  consumer  industrial  infrastructure  medical  military  radio frequency identification rfid  satellite and wireless data 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in the past  average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future 
our operating results have been  and our operating results may continue to be  negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as changes in demand for end user equipment  the timing of the receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  availability and cost of products from suppliers  new product and technology introductions by competitors  changes in the mix of products produced and sold  intellectual property disputes  the 
table of contents timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions 
in addition  we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped  which may require us to pay warranty claims  replace products  or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer s products containing our parts 
business framework to address the wireless industry opportunities discussed above and execute to our strategy  we have aligned our product portfolio around two markets mobile platforms and linear products 
we believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios that  when coupled with key customer relationships with all major handset manufacturers  positions us well to meet industry needs 
basis of presentation on june   pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization  dated as of december   as amended as of april   by and among alpha industries  inc alpha  conexant systems  inc 
conexant and washington sub  inc washington  a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business  including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in newbury park  california  but excluding certain assets and liabilities  washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving entity the merger 
immediately following the merger  we purchased conexant s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in mexicali  mexico and certain related operations the mexicali operations 
the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to herein as washington mexicali 
following the merger  alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions  inc our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on october   and fiscal years and each consisted of weeks and ended on september  and october   respectively 
for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 
general during fiscal  certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations 
more specifically  we experienced an increase in revenues from our radio frequency rf products of in aggregate dollars and in units shipped from fiscal to fiscal  tempered somewhat by a decrease in revenues for our cellular systems products of in aggregate dollars and in units shipped  experienced a increase in aggregate revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite an approximate decline in average selling prices of our more mature single functionality products and an approximate average selling price decline in our more highly integrated  complex next generation products 
we achieved an increase in overall units sold  experienced a decrease in revenues from our assembly and test services area in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as we fulfilled our agreement with conexant and have exited this product area  experienced a decrease in gross profits in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally due to product mix shifts  a one time payment to a customer and continued additional costs associated with our highly integrated products  reduced overall operating expenses by primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses from fiscal year and increased operating income by from fiscal year to  increased revenues from our family of ipac power amplifiers and intera transmit front end modules in fiscal as compared to we also introduced helios  our patented and highly innovative edge radio solution in fiscal  and increased cash and short term investments by million while still investing an additional million in capital equipment 

table of contents results of operations years ended september   and the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below net revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets special charges total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
net income loss net revenues years ended september  change change in thousands net revenues we market and sell our semiconductor products and system solutions to leading original equipment manufacturers oems of communication electronics products  third party original design manufacturers odms and contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
net revenues increased slightly overall in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily as a result of increased demand in our rf product area 
revenues in aggregate dollars from our highly integrated complex rf products more than doubled between fiscal and fiscal this increase in revenues was partially offset by an overall decrease in average selling prices in nearly all of our product areas 
additionally  cellular systems revenue in aggregate dollars declined and revenues from test and assembly declined by due to the termination of the test and assembly services arrangement with conexant 
our revenues from the test and assembly business averaged million per quarter in fiscal and were million in the second fiscal quarter of we fulfilled our manufacturing support obligation to conexant on june  net revenues increased for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as the result of increased demand for our wireless product portfolio 
more specifically  we had launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings  added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence 
additionally  power amplifiers  front end modules  rf subsystems and complete cellular systems exhibited strong year over year growth 
these increases in net revenues were tempered by a decrease in average selling prices primarily within our single function products and a decrease of approximately million in net revenues for our assembly and test services as demand for these services declined in fiscal during fiscal  the number of units we sold increased by approximately when compared to fiscal  however our average selling price across all products decreased in the aggregate by approximately when compared to the previous fiscal year 

table of contents for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of the last three fiscal years  see note of item of this annual report on form k 
gross profit years ended september  change change in thousands gross profit of net revenues gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing  royalty and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
gross profit for fiscal decreased by million and gross profit margin decreased from to from fiscal the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to continued additional costs associated with the ongoing launch of a number of our more highly integrated products  an unfavorable shift in product mix in the fourth fiscal quarter  and a one time payment to a customer of million in the fourth fiscal quarter 
a decline in the assembly and test services provided to conexant in conjunction with fixed overhead and manufacturing costs in the assembly and test area also contributed to the decreased gross profit margin between fiscal and fiscal gross profit for fiscal benefited from increased operational efficiency through capacity utilization when compared to the previous fiscal year 
this benefit was partially offset by the aforementioned decline in average selling prices and additional costs we incurred as we launched and ramped a number of more highly integrated rf product offerings including our front end modules and single package radios 
research and development years ended september  change change in thousands research and development of net revenues research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  and design and test tool costs 
research and development expenses in fiscal declined slightly when compared to fiscal the decline is principally due to decreased incentive compensation costs 
we remain committed to streamlining and focusing product development efforts on next generation  highly integrated products to meet the needs of our customers 
we also reduced research and development expenditures in our cellular systems product area 
more specifically  we focused our product development on core front end modules  rf subsystems  infrastructure and next generation solutions 
research and development expenses were lower in fiscal when compared to the previous year as we realized benefits from cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two fiscal years 
selling  general and administrative years ended september  change change in thousands selling  general and administrative of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  etc  sales representative commissions  advertising and other marketing costs 

table of contents the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of million between fiscal and fiscal additionally  costs incurred to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of contributed to the increase 
the increased bad debt expense and sarbanes oxley fees were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation costs and legal costs due to the settlement of an intellectual property lawsuit 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal when compared to the previous year is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in legal expenses related to protecting our intellectual property portfolio 
in addition  we incurred incentive related compensation expenses in fiscal  which were not incurred in fiscal we tie incentive compensation to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives each fiscal year and met these objectives in fiscal  whereas these objectives were not met in fiscal during fiscal  we also incurred information systems conversion costs  whereas these expenses were not incurred in fiscal we transitioned our information systems services from conexant systems  inc to a third party service provider during the third quarter of fiscal these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal when compared to the previous year were partially offset by realization of the benefit of cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two fiscal years 
amortization of intangible assets and warrants years ended september  change change in thousands amortization of intangible assets of net revenues in  we recorded million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology  customer relationships and a trademark 
these assets are principally being amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
amortization expense in fiscal   and primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense on intangible assets between fiscal and fiscal is the result of million in amortization expense recognized on certain warrants in  while only million was recognized in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down certain intangible assets related to our infrastructure business based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to a decline in demand for  and a decision to discontinue  certain infrastructure products 
this write down established a new cost basis for these assets and resulted in a decrease in amortization expense for fiscal when compared to fiscal for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges years ended september  change change in thousands special charges of net revenues no special charges were recorded in fiscal special charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities  as follows asset impairments during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge primarily related to the impairment of obsolete baseband technology licenses that were established prior to the merger 
the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to the decision to discontinue certain products and the related impact on its current and projected outlook 
management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets 
table of contents intangible assets  machinery and equipment was impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products salvage value 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain infrastructure products manufactured in our woburn  massachusetts and adamstown  maryland facilities 
the woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology 
our adamstown  maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components 
we experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products 
the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook 
we projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets machinery  equipment and intangible assets may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a five year period 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows 
management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
the anticipated pre tax cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be million from fiscal through fiscal and million from fiscal through fiscal we realized actual savings from this asset impairment of million in fiscal and this amount related to depreciation expense that was not recorded due to the impairment of the assets 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of our haverhill  massachusetts property based on a third party estimate of its fair value 
in fiscal  we relocated our operations from this facility to our woburn  massachusetts facility 
in march  we entered into a contractual arrangement for the sale of the property  contingent upon obtaining specific regulatory approvals 
as of september   the prospective buyer with our approval had received a portion of these regulatory approvals and anticipates receiving the remaining regulatory approval in if the prospective buyer does not receive all regulatory approvals by june   the prospective buyer has the option of terminating the original contract 
alternatively  the prospective buyer can renegotiate or extend the original contract with our approval 
restructuring charges during fiscal  we consolidated cellular systems software design centers in an effort to improve our overall time to market for next generation multimedia systems development 
these actions aligned our structure with our current business environment 
we implemented reductions in force at three remote facilities and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for costs related to severance benefits for affected employees and lease obligations 
substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid as of september  during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities 
the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation  facility sales  and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities 
all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid as of september  for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents interest expense years ended september  change change in thousands interest expense of net revenues interest expense is comprised principally of payments on our million credit facility facility agreement and junior notes payable 
the decrease in interest expense for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year is due to the conversion of our million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock during fiscal specifically  we recorded million in interest expense and deferred financing costs amortization on our million junior notes payable and million in interest expense on our million line of credit facility 
the decrease in interest expense for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily related to the conversion of our million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal on april   we notified the holder of the senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on may  on may   the holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately million shares of our common stock 
we paid interest in cash on the senior notes on the last business day of each march  june  september and december of each year 
interest paid on the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature 
for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income  net years ended september  change change in thousands other income  net of net revenues other income  net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances  foreign exchange gains losses and other non operating income and expense items 
the increase in other income  net between fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to higher levels of interest bearing short term investments in fiscal as compared to fiscal and higher average interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in other income  net between fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to higher levels of interest bearing short term investments in fiscal and slightly higher short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes years ended september  change change in thousands provision for income taxes of net revenues based upon a history of significant operating losses  management has determined that it is more likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future deductions associated with the mexicali operations in the post merger period 
consequently  no u 
s 
income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the us operating losses 
as of september   we established a valuation allowance against all of our net us deferred tax assets 
during fiscal we reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets by million relating to the tax benefit recorded in fiscal for the impairment of our assembly and test machinery and equipment in mexicali  mexico 
in the first quarter of fiscal  a charge of million resulted from a reduction of the statutory income tax rate in mexico 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a charge of million related to normal amortization of 
table of contents the tax benefit for tax over book depreciation 
a favorable foreign translation adjustment of million increased the deferred tax asset s carrying value 
in addition  the provision for income taxes for fiscal  and consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations 
we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the united states until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal and fiscal consists of approximately million and million  respectively  of us income taxes recorded as a charge reducing the carrying value of goodwill 
no benefit has been recognized for utilizing certain pre merger deferred tax assets 
the utilization of these deferred items reduces the carrying value of goodwill  ie  charge in lieu of tax expense  instead of reducing income tax expense 
we will evaluate the realization of the pre merger deferred tax assets periodically and adjust the provision for income taxes accordingly 
as a result  the effective tax rate may vary in subsequent periods 
no provision has been made for united states federal  state  or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
in fiscal our subsidiary in mexico dividended approximately million of earnings to the united states 
such earnings  which were not subject to mexico withholding tax and could be applied against us net operating loss carryforwards  resulted in no significant us income tax expense 
earnings of our mexico subsidiary are no longer considered permanently reinvested  and accordingly  us income taxes are provided on current earnings attributable to our earnings in mexico 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle years ended september  change change in thousands cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  october  and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill 
as a result  we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was million greater than its implied fair value 
this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and is reflected in our results of operations as of the beginning of fiscal we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and determined that as of july   our goodwill was not impaired 
liquidity and capital resources years ended september in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period 
table of contents fiscal during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
this was principally attributable to increased revenues and lower overall operating expenses combined with reduced interest expense and higher other income primarily interest income 
non cash charges including depreciation  charge in lieu of income tax expense  amortization and contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans totaled million 
this was offset by a reduction in liabilities of million primarily related to payment of prior year incentive compensation 
annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal were inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
other decreases to cash provided by operating activities resulted from an net increase in our receivable balances of million offset by bad debt provisions of million 
the increase in accounts receivable balances is due to the timing and collection of customer receivables 
the timing of purchasing patterns by our customers in our industry affects the timing of our revenue recognition and our collections and is one of the principal reasons for the increase in days sales outstanding from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal in october  we were notified by vitelcom mobile one of our tier three customers that it had sustained significant weather related damage to one of its manufacturing facilities in mexico 
due to the business interruption caused by this event  the customer notified us that it would defer making cash payments on a previously arranged payment plan 
while we currently anticipate that this receivable will ultimately be collectible  the customer nevertheless is not making timely payments on the amounts owed to us and thus our near term cash payments from this customer remain uncertain 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  consisted of million of net investments in auction rate securities and capital expenditures of million 
we anticipate our capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities 
future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from operations 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september   consisted of million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
we have short term debt which consists of a million credit facility and long term debt which consists of a million convertible subordinated note payable which will become due in november there were no changes to the long term and short term debt balances in fiscal we expect to maintain these balances through fiscal for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal during fiscal  we made progress in several key areas as we focused our efforts on both cash and inventory management 
we significantly reduced the number of days sales outstanding in the fourth quarter of fiscal to from for the same period in the previous fiscal year 
annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal were during fiscal  we also converted our percent convertible senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock  ultimately reducing our future cash outflows and expenses related to the interest incurred on these senior subordinated notes 
in fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities as we experienced a significant improvement in our operating results when compared to the previous fiscal year 
this improvement was primarily attributable to increased net revenues in fiscal  when compared to the previous fiscal year  primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product portfolio 
more specifically  we had launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings  added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence 
in addition  we reduced research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal  from for the previous fiscal year 
during fiscal  we invested million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly integrated products and processes  enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our customers demands 
in fiscal we made net investments of approximately million in short term auction rate securities 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily represents an increase in borrowings under our million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank  na 
table of contents fiscal cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  reflecting a net loss of million  offset by non cash charges primarily asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of million and a net decrease in working capital items of approximately million  including million of merger related expense payments 
as of september   substantially all amounts accrued for merger related expenses had been paid 
we adopted sfas no 
on october   and recorded a million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures for fiscal represented our continued investment in production and test facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers demands 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal also included million of purchases of short term investments 
our short term investments were classified as held to maturity and consisted primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than days and less than twelve months 
on august   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec with respect to the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of securities  including debt securities  common or preferred shares  warrants or any combination thereof 
this registration statement  which the sec declared effective on august   provides us with greater flexibility and access to capital 
on september   we issued million shares of common stock under our shelf registration statement 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal included approximately million of net proceeds from this offering 
we may from time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal also included the net impact of our private placement of million of percent convertible subordinated notes due november and related debt refinancing with conexant on november  these subordinated notes could be converted into shares of common stock per  principal balance  which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately per share 
the net proceeds from the note offering were principally used to prepay million of the million debt to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations and to prepay the million principal amount outstanding as of november   under a separate loan facility with conexant 
in connection with our prepayment of million of the million debt owed to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations  the remaining million principal balance was exchanged for new convertible senior subordinated notes with a maturity date of june  on april   we notified the holder of the senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on may  on may   the holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately million shares of our common stock 
in addition to the retirement of million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to conexant  we also retained approximately million of net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs 
in addition  as of september   we had borrowings outstanding of million under our million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank  na contractual cash flows following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt  purchase agreements and operating leases at september  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements  in thousands payments due by period less than obligation total year years years thereafter debt operating leases other commitments based on our results of operations for fiscal and current trends  we expect our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  debt obligations  purchase obligations  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the 
table of contents future 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources 
if we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all  our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
inventories we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels relative to sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of six months  we write down the value of those excess inventories 
in determining the net realizable value of our inventories  we review the valuations of inventory considered excessively old  and therefore subject to obsolescence 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and to value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
once established  write downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory 
we sell our products to communications equipment original equipment manufacturers oems that have designed our products into equipment such as cellular handsets 
these design wins are gained through a lengthy sales cycle  which includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
consequently  when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the net realizable value of such inventories is generally estimated to be zero 
the amount of the write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets carrying values for long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with sfas no 
 which was adopted on october  impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 
carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 which was adopted on october  the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter july and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 

table of contents deferred income taxes we have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial united states deferred tax assets 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
the future realization of certain deferred tax assets will be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
the portion of the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the merger is approximately million 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets 
a valuation allowance has not been established because we believe that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward period

is effective for accounting changes and error corrections occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  other matters inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended september  certain business risks we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of the risks  which may affect our future operating results 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  changes in general economic conditions  together with other factors  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry 
periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
these characteristics  and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets  may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations 
furthermore  downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or the wireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

table of contents we have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses 
our operating results for fiscal years and were adversely affected by a global economic slowdown  decreased consumer confidence  reduced capital spending  and adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries 
these factors led to a slowdown in customer orders  an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog  higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue  and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate our wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions 
although we emerged from this period of economic weakness in fiscal  should economic conditions deteriorate for any reason  it could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix  and other impacts that would materially and adversely affect our operating results 
due to this economic uncertainty  although we were profitable in fiscal and fiscal  we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such profitability or that we will not experience future operating losses 
additionally  the conflict in iraq  as well as other contemporary international conflicts  natural disasters  acts of terrorism  and civil and military unrest contributes to the economic uncertainty 
these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to place continued pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen or both  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive 
we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share 
we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
furthermore  additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics  the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include  among others time to market  timely new product innovation  product quality  reliability and performance  product price  features available in products  compliance with industry standards  strategic relationships with customers  and access to and protection of intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors 
many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of long presence in key markets  name recognition  high levels of customer satisfaction  ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property  and strong financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical or other resources 
as a result  certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish  financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers  resellers or other third parties 
these relationships may affect customers purchasing decisions 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
furthermore  some of our customers have divisions that internally develop or manufacture products similar to ours  and may compete with us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock based compensation will adversely affect our results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment to require companies to expense employee stock options for financial reporting purposes  effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  such stock option expensing will require us to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to an option 
table of contents valuation formula and amortize that value against our earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options 
we currently account for stock based awards to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
in april  the sec issued a rule amending the compliance date which allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  as a result  we implemented sfas r in the reporting period starting october  when we are required to expense employee stock options in the first quarter of fiscal  this change in accounting treatment will materially affect our reported results of operations as the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings but will have no impact on cash flows from operations 
we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will approximate million in fiscal through this expense projection is calculated as of september  and does not taken into account any future equity awards that we might issue nor does it account for future actual stock based award forfeitures 
we will be required to adjust future stock based compensation expense for actual future stock option forfeitures 
our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized 
our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption  including for causes beyond our control 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps 
it requires production in a highly controlled  clean environment 
minor impurities  contamination of the clean room environment  errors in any step of the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  defects in equipment or materials  human error  or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction 
because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields  these factors could have a material adverse affect on our business 
in addition  we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped  which may require us to pay warranty claims  replace products  or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer s products containing our parts 
additionally  our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors 
these disruptions may include electrical power outages  fire  earthquake  flooding  war  acts of terrorism  health advisories or risks  or other natural or man made disasters 
disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor 
in the event of such delays  we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity  particularly wafer production capacity  would be available on a timely basis or at all 
even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available  we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms  which could result in higher costs and or a loss of customers 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 
due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process  in the event of a disruption at the newbury park  california or woburn  massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities  alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third party sources 
these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 
minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss  and in some cases  cause production to be suspended 
manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing  and typically increase as we bring the product to full production 
our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and  as a result  material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability 
the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products 
our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles  which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without  in many cases  reaching the longer term  high volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 
we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture  assembly and test of our products 
we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities  called foundries  to provide silicon based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity 
we also utilize subcontractors to package  assemble and test our products 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on third party foundries  including 
table of contents the lack of ensured wafer supply  potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  production costs and quality assurance  and the inaccessibility of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
although we have long term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity  the third party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers 
if we choose to use a new foundry  it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
the foundries may experience financial difficulties  be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities  particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones 
if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs  we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available 
we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products  which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 
our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes 
we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery schedules  our ability to satisfy customer obligations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis 
in connection with our ongoing review  we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers 
we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs 
while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials  we are currently dependent on a sole source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities 
to the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components  the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and  in particular  the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product evolution  price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles  increasing demand for higher levels of integration  increased miniaturization  and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis 
the successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors  including the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards  the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand  the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements  the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis  the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors  overall market acceptance of our products  and the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products 
our ability to manufacture current products  and to develop new products  depends  among other factors  on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems it systems 
we upgrade and change our it systems from time to time  and recently completed a system upgrade  and there can be no assurance that such upgrade will be successful 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner 
we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost effective manner  that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and 
table of contents introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface 
if we fail to rapidly and cost effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements  our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed 
in addition  prices of many of our products decline  sometimes significantly  over time 
we believe that to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 
the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change 
the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate 
our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics rapid technological developments and product evolution  rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  demand for higher levels of integration  decreased size and decreased power consumption  short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product  and evolving industry standards 
these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products 
our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the above noted factors 
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our key technical personnel represent a significant asset 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry  and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products 
we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance  given  among other things  the use of equity based compensation by us and our competitors 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
if oems and odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment  we will have difficulty selling those products 
moreover  a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 
our products are not sold directly to the end user  but are components or subsystems of other products 
as a result  we rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
without these design wins  we would have difficulty selling our products 
if a manufacturer designs another supplier s product into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer 
also  achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer 
even after a design win  the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products  for example  if its own products are not commercially successful  or for any other reason 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales  and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 
after our product has been developed  tested and manufactured  our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate  test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product 
this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may incur significant research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  before we generate the related 
table of contents revenues for these products 
furthermore  we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long term supply arrangements with our customers 
our customers may cancel orders before shipment 
additionally  we sell a portion of our products through distributors  some of whom have rights to return unsold products 
we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products  or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in inventory write downs and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
a significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if we lost one or more of these major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of our products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
sales to our three largest customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue for fiscal we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short 
in the semiconductor industry  product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles 
therefore  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue  and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory 
if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
on september   we had total indebtedness of approximately million  which represented approximately of our total capitalization 
as long as our percent convertible subordinated notes due november remain outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately  per year in interest payments 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our business 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash expected to be generated by our operations  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other long term debt  lines of credit and other financing 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
despite our current debt levels  we are able to incur substantially more debt  which would increase the risks described above 

table of contents we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 
we may need to obtain sources of financing in the future 
we expect our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  debt obligations  purchase obligations  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future 
to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
conditions existing in the us capital markets  if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the company  will affect our ability to raise capital  as well as the terms of any such financing 
we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all 
failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources 
we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 
remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products  design new products to more stringent standards  and to redesign some existing products 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in sub optimal manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future 
in some instances  we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 
a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily countries located in the asia pacific region and europe 
in addition  we have design centers and suppliers located outside the united states  and third party packaging  assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asia pacific region 
finally  we have our own packaging  assembly and test facility in mexicali  mexico 
our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad 
these include  but are not limited to  risks regarding currency exchange rate fluctuations  local economic and political conditions  including social  economic and political instability  disruptions of capital and trading markets  restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures  including export duties  quotas  customs duties  import or export controls and tariffs  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  natural disasters  acts of terrorism  widespread illness and war  limitations on the repatriation of funds  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  cultural differences in the conduct of business  the laws and policies of the united states and other countries affecting trade  foreign investment and loans  and import or export licensing requirements  tax laws  the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction  and limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

table of contents additionally  we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers 
increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors  which could impact the demand for our products 
limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea  japan  china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 
our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 
our revenues  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues  earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others changes in end user demand for the products principally digital cellular handsets manufactured and sold by our customers  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from our suppliers  the gain or loss of significant customers  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  new product and technology introductions by competitors  changes in the mix of products produced and sold  market acceptance of our products and our customers  and intellectual property disputes 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
global economic weakness can have wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
although the wireless communications industry has recovered somewhat from an industry wide recession  such recovery may not continue 
in addition  we cannot predict what effects negative events  such as war or other international conflicts  may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties 
further  a continued economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term 
if it does not  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 
among our product portfolio  we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components  principally power amplifiers and switches 
the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits 
the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes 
therefore  to remain competitive  we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon based counterparts 
if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts 
silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

table of contents we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it 
any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another  including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
regardless of the merits of any specific claim  we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  import  use  sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes  discontinue the use of infringing technology  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and license technology from the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 
many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration 
our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture 
if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
in such instances  we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  it may harm our ability to compete 
we rely on patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies  information  data  devices  algorithms and processes 
in addition  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers  suppliers or other third parties into our designs  and we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such third party intellectual property 
in the future  it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take to prevent misappropriation  infringement  dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers  suppliers or other third parties will be successful  any existing or future patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology  it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products  potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion 
even if we receive a patent  the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology 
furthermore  even if we receive patent protection in the united states  we may not seek  or may not be granted  patent protection in foreign countries 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 
there is a growing industry trend to include or adapt open source software that is generally made available to the public by its developers  authors or third parties 
often such software includes license provisions  requiring public disclosure of any derivative works containing open source code 
there is little legal precedent in the area of open source software or its effects on 
table of contents copyright law or the protection of proprietary works 
we take steps to avoid the use of open source works in our proprietary software  and are taking steps to limit our suppliers from doing so 
however  in the event a copyright holder were to demonstrate in court that we have not complied with a software license  we may be required to cease production or distribution of that work or to publicly disclose the source code for our proprietary software  which may negatively affect our operations or stock price 
we attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational  technological and legal safeguards 
despite our efforts  parties  including former or current employees  may attempt to copy  disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization 
furthermore  attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations 
while we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used  or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to effect suitable investments  alliances and acquisitions  and to integrate companies we acquire 
although we have in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities  the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own 
on an ongoing basis  we intend to review investment  alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment  alliance or acquisition transactions in the future 
moreover  if we consummate such transactions  they could result in issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders  large one time write offs  the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities  the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company  amortization expenses related to intangible assets  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
moreover  integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult  expensive  time consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful 
additionally  in periods following an acquisition  we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets for impairment 
when such assets are found to be impaired  they will be written down to estimated fair value  with a charge against earnings 
for instance  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal in the amount of million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the merger 
certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 
we have certain anti takeover measures that may affect our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions such as the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis  one class each year  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by laws  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors  the classified board or the right to act by written consent  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the board of 
table of contents directors and  in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of or more of our shares  a majority of the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of or more of our shares  a fair price provision  and a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision 
in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  section of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 
increasingly stringent environmental laws  rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes  and could adversely affect our ability to cost effectively produce our products 
the semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmental regulations 
a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances  a number of which have been used in our products or processes 
for example  the european union restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components by july  removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances  as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the rohs directive 
alternative substances may not be readily available or commercially feasible  may only be available from a single source  or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts 
while we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations  if we are unable to complete the transition in a timely manner  or ensure consistent quality and product yields with redesigned processes  our operations may be adversely affected 
we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws  rules and regulations  which could adversely impact our business 
we have used  and will continue to use  a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states and in foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault 
consequently  it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters  including potential liabilities 
furthermore  our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations 
we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities  to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future 
accordingly  you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors  including our performance and prospects  the performance and prospects of our major customers  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate  changes in earnings estimates or buy sell recommendations by analysts  general financial and other market conditions  and domestic and international economic conditions 
public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in the technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  fluctuations in our stock price  volume of shares traded  and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
our company has been  and in the future may be  the subject of commentary by financial news media 
such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline  possibly substantially over a short period of time 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks  such as changes in currency and interest rates that arise from normal business operation 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  short term debt and long term debt 
our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital 
consequently  we invest with only high credit quality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
our short term debt primarily consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank  na as of september   we had borrowings of million outstanding under this credit facility 
interest related to our short term debt is at libor plus and was approximately at september  consequently  we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our short term debt 
we issued fixed rate debt  which is convertible into our common stock at a predetermined conversion price 
convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interest rate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interest rate environment and the price of the underlying common stock 
for the year ended september   our convertible debt  on an if converted basis  was not dilutive and  as a result  had no impact on our net income per share assuming dilution 
in future periods  the debt may be converted  or the if converted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced 
our long term debt consists of million of unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september   a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily the result of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in various foreign countries 
we do not currently use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
we estimate that we do not have any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk
