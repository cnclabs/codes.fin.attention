actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions  and the differences could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
table of contents in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense would increase by the same amount 
hurricane katrina the company has recorded insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina when realization of the claim for recovery has been deemed probable and only to the extent the loss has been recorded in the financial statements 
any possible gain that may result from recoveries under the company s insurance policies will be recognized when the insurance proceeds are received 
hurricane katrina struck mississippi and louisiana on august   and resulted in significant damage to south mississippi and southeastern louisiana 
although the company experienced no significant damage to any of its facilities in the affected areas  the company s operations throughout the region were affected by the loss of electricity to the company s facilities and to the facilities of the company s independent contract growers 
hurricane katrina also destroyed approximately three million live chickens and approximately million hatching eggs were either lost or destroyed and were not placed as broiler chicks 
in addition  hurricane katrina destroyed approximately million of processed inventory in independent contract cold storage facilities  as well as a lesser amount of processed product and other inventory in company owned facilities 
the company s financial statements for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended october   reflect a receivable from the company s insurance carriers of million for property damage  expenses incurred and lost profits resulting from hurricane katrina 
the company s total insurance claim through october   for property damage  expenses incurred and lost profits is million  net of the applicable deductible of  the total reduction in operating income of million relates to the deductible of  and incurred but unrecognized lost profits and expenses of approximately million 
the unrecognized lost profits and expenses of million were the direct result of the effect of hurricane katrina and the company s efforts to minimize the potential loss from the hurricane and will be recognized once negotiations with the insurance carriers are complete and the final amounts are determined 
the company intends to seek reimbursement for all of its insured losses  including the unrecognized lost profits and expenses 
negotiations with the company s insurance carriers are expected to be completed during the company believes the remaining effects of lost production and additional expenses related to hurricane katrina that will be incurred during the first fiscal quarter of will also be substantially covered by the company s insurance policies 
inventories processed food and poultry inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for poultry or feed grains move substantially lower  the company would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market value  which would increase the company s costs of sales 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and payments to the growers who raise the chicks for us  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the 
table of contents straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
if market prices for chicks  feed or medicine or if grower payments increase or decrease during the period  the company could have an increase or decrease in the market value of its inventory as well as an increase or decrease in costs of sales 
should the company decide that the nine month amortization period used to amortize the breeder costs is no longer appropriate as a result of operational changes  a shorter or longer amortization period could increase or decrease the costs of sales recorded in future periods 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
if the company s assumptions with respect to the future expected cash flows associated with the use of long lived assets currently recorded change  then the company s determination that no impairment charges are necessary may change and result in the company recording an impairment charge in a future period 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
if historical experience proves not to be a good indicator of future expenses  if management were to use different actuarial assumptions  or if there is a negative trend in the company s claims history  there could be a significant increase or decrease in cost of sales depending on whether these expenses increased or decreased  respectively 
income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities and considers any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing the company s income tax expense 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal proceedings and recognizes the costs of legal defense in the periods incurred 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these matters is made after considerable analysis of each individual case 
at this time  the company has not accrued any reserve for any of these matters 
future reserves may be required due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of legal strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of or changes to reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb 
table of contents opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our audited financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the income tax benefits of such deductions were  and  for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
also  under the provision of fas r  unearned compensation related to unvested restricted stock awards are not recorded 
accordingly  any remaining unearned compensation related to unvested restricted stock awards and the corresponding amount in paid in capital will no longer be included in stockholders equity beginning november  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the impact that sfas no 
will have on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal  for use in manufacturing feed for its chickens 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
feed grains are subject to volatile price changes caused by factors described below that include weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability 
generally  the company purchases its corn  soybean meal and other feed ingredients for prompt delivery to its feed mills at market prices at the time of such purchases 
the company sometimes will purchase feed ingredients for deferred delivery that typically ranges from one month to six months after the time of purchase 
the grain purchases are made directly with our usual grain suppliers  which are companies in the regular business of supplying grain to end users  and do not involve options to purchase 
such purchases occur when senior management concludes that market factors indicate that prices at the time the grain is needed are likely to be higher than current prices  or where  based on current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products  management believes it can purchase feed ingredients at prices that will allow the company to earn a reasonable return for its shareholders 
market factors considered by management in determining whether or not and to what extent to buy grain for deferred delivery include current market prices  current and predicted weather patterns in the united states  south america  china and other grain producing areas  as such weather patterns might affect the planting  growing  harvesting and yield of feed grains  
table of contents the expected size of the harvest of feed grains in the united states and other grain producing areas of the world as reported by governmental and private sources  current and expected changes to the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments  the relative strength of united states currency and expected changes therein as it might impact the ability of foreign countries to buy united states feed grain commodities  the current and expected volumes of export of feed grain commodities as reported by governmental and private sources  the current and expected use of available feed grains for uses other than as livestock feed grains such as the use of corn for the production of ethanol  which use is impacted by the price of crude oil  and current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products 
the company purchases physical grain  not financial instruments such as puts  calls or straddles that derive their value from the value of physical grain 
thus  the company does not use derivative financial instruments as defined by sfas  accounting for derivatives for instruments and hedging activities 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions or purchase any grain related contracts other than the physical grain contracts described above 
the cost of feed grains is recognized in cost of sales  on a first in first out basis  at the same time that the sales of the chickens that consume the feed grains are recognized
