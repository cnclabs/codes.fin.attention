item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the annual report and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item titled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this annual report 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products for cancer based on our telomerase technology  and cell based therapeutics using our human embryonic stem cell technology as discussed in more detail in item business of this annual report on form k beginning on page critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion or our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize option payments as revenue over the period of the option agreement 
we recognize milestone payments upon completion of specified milestones according to contract terms 
we generally recognize royalties as revenue upon receipt 
we estimate the projected future life of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated lives have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future lives of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
in the past  we recognized cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs were incurred 
deferred revenue represented the portion of research payments received which had not been earned 
as of december   we did not have any collaborative agreements with cost reimbursement provisions 
intangible asset and research funding obligation in may  we completed the acquisition of roslin bio med ltd  a privately held company formed by the roslin institute in midlothian  scotland 
in connection with this acquisition  we formed a research collaboration with the roslin institute and committed approximately  in research funding over six years 
using an effective interest rate of  this research funding obligation had a net present value of  at the acquisition date and was capitalized as an intangible asset that was being amortized as research and development expense over the six year funding period 
in december  we extended the research funding period from june  to june  and we adjusted the amortization period of the intangible asset to coincide with the extended research period 
no additional funding was committed 
imputed interest is being accreted to the value of the research funding obligation and is recognized as interest expense 
at the time of acquisition  we estimated the effective interest rate and have been evaluating the spending rate under the collaboration as compared to the contractual funding period 
revisions in the effective interest rate or amortization period would have the effect of increasing or decreasing research and development expense as well as the balance of intangible assets and research funding obligation on the balance sheet 
as of december   no revisions to the effective interest rate have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
further adjustments to the amortization period may occur as we near the end of extended research period and evaluate our continuing research support 
valuation of equity instruments as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures sfas  we elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb opinion and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we are generally not required under apb opinion and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
to comply with sfas  we presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the pro forma effect on our net loss and loss per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  as amended  to options granted to employees under our stock based employee compensation plans 
in valuing our options using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the options 
risk free interest rates are derived from united states zero coupon treasury strip yields as of the option grant date 
dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments  which have been zero to date 
volatility is derived from the historical volatility of our common stock as traded on nasdaq 
the weighted average expected lives of the options is based on historical experience of option exercises and the average vesting option schedule 
each year  we have consistently applied the same methodology when deriving these assumptions 
revisions of any of these assumptions would increase or decrease the value of the option and increase or decrease the pro forma effect on reported net income loss and earnings loss per share if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method 
as of december   no revisions to the methods used in arriving at the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model have been made and revisions may occur in the future with the adoption of sfas r 
in valuing our warrants using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the warrants 
risk free interest rates are derived from united states zero coupon treasury strip yields as of the warrant issue date 
dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments  which have been zero to date 
volatility is derived from the historical volatility of our common stock as traded on nasdaq 
the weighted average expected lives of the warrants is based on the term of the warrants 
upon issuance of a warrant to consultants or collaborators  we recognize an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
upon issuance of warrants in connection with an equity financing  we recognize issuance costs with an offset to additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets 
each year  we have consistently applied the same methodology when deriving these assumptions 
revisions of any of these assumptions would increase or decrease the value of the warrant and increase or decrease the expense or issuance cost recognized upon issuance of the warrant 
as of december   no revisions to the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model have been made and revisions may occur in the future with the adoption of sfas r 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a therapeutic product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials that demonstrate its efficacy and safety  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized no revenues from collaborative agreements in compared to  in and  in we recognize revenue under collaborative agreements as we incur the related research and development costs 
revenues in primarily reflected cost reimbursements from consulting contracts 
revenues in primarily reflected the final research support payment from our collaborative agreement with kyowa hakko 
in  kyowa hakko completed their research funding to us as contractually agreed 
we did not receive any funding payments from kyowa hakko in or in june  kyowa hakko returned asian territory development and marketing rights for geron s telomerase inhibitors and terminated their research and license agreement with us 
we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license and option fee revenues of   and  in  and  respectively  related to our various agreements 
also  we received royalties of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market  cell based research products and agricultural products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
we expect to recognize revenue of  in   in   in   in and  thereafter related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to an increase of million for raw materials for the manufacture of grnl  million for scientific supplies  for animal toxicology studies related to the clinical development of grnl and  for clinical consulting and sponsored research at other academic laboratories 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a reduction in personnel related costs of approximately million associated with restructurings in january and a reduction in external research support costs of approximately  overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next year as we incur expenses related to manufacturing and testing of grnl  continue clinical trials of our telomerase cancer vaccine and continue development of our human embryonic stem cell hesc programs 
our research and development activities can be divided into two major categories of related programs  oncology and hesc therapies 
the oncology programs focus on treating or diagnosing cancer by targeting or detecting the presence of telomerase  either inhibiting activity of the telomerase enzyme  diagnosing cancer by detecting the presence of telomerase  or using telomerase as a target for therapeutic vaccines 
our core knowledge base in telomerase and telomere biology supports all these approaches  and our scientists may contribute to any or all of these programs in a given period 
for our telomerase inhibition program  we are targeting completion of the preclinical animal toxicology and efficacy studies by early  after which we expect to prepare and file an ind application on grnl 
a telomerase therapeutic vaccine for patients with metastatic prostate cancer is currently in an investigator sponsored phase clinical study at duke university medical center 
study results thus far have shown no treatment related adverse effects to date as well as specific immune responses to telomerase 
we are currently conducting several additional small phase trials  also in prostate cancer at duke  in order to optimize the vaccination process 
we are also bringing the vaccine manufacturing process in house for further optimization and exploration in other cancer types 
at the conclusion of these activities  we plan to file an ind for a phase clinical study for the telomerase therapeutic vaccine 
our hesc therapy programs focus on treating injuries and degenerative diseases with cell therapies based on cells derived from hescs 
a core of knowledge of hesc biology  as well as a significant continuing effort in deriving  growing  maintaining  and differentiating hescs  underlies all aspects of this group of programs 
many of our researchers are allocated to more than one hesc project  and the percentage allocations of time change as the resource needs of individual programs vary 
in our hesc therapy programs  we have concentrated our resources on several specific cell types 
we have developed proprietary methods to derive  maintain and scale up undifferentiated hescs and differentiate them into therapeutically relevant cells 
we are now testing six different therapeutic cell types in animal models 
in four of these cell types  we have preliminary results suggesting efficacy as evidenced by functional improvements or durable engraftment of the treated animals 
after completion of these studies  we expect to begin one or more phase clinical trials  most likely including one for the treatment of spinal cord injury 
research and development expenses allocated to programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  oncology hesc therapies total at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to complete the programs currently in progress 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an ind 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are incurred in phase trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda must be filed with the fda  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda must be reviewed and approved by the fda 
according to industry statistics  on average it takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict 
our clinical development programs are updated and changed periodically to reflect the most recent preclinical and clinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot assure you that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and other countries  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products and entry into clinical trials with one or more product candidates may not result in any commercially viable products in the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report 
acquired in process research technology in march  we entered into an agreement with merix bioscience  inc now argos therapeutics  inc under which we acquired a co exclusive right under patents controlled by merix for the use of defined antigens in therapeutic cancer vaccines 
in conjunction with the agreement  we issued  shares of geron common stock to merix 
we acquired rights to the merix technology for commercial development of our therapeutic cancer vaccine 
further development of the technology is required before we can enter into advanced clinical trials for a potential commercial application 
we have concluded that this technology has no alternative future use as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and accordingly  expensed the value of the acquired in process research technology of million at the time of acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from primarily reflects an increase in patent legal costs of  and an increase in corporate legal and accounting expenses of  for additional regulatory compliance related to the sarbanes oxley act and various equity transactions with vendors 
the decrease in from was the result of a reduction in personnel related costs of  as a result of the restructuring announced in january  partially offset by increased external accounting and legal costs of  we expect general and administrative expenses related to accounting to increase in order to comply with significant new government imposed procedures  reporting and audit requirements 
interest and other income interest income was million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was due to higher cash and investment balances as a result of proceeds received from equity financings in november and also included in interest income for was a realized loss of approximately  related to an other than temporary decline in value for one of our equity investments in a licensee 
the decrease in as compared to was the net result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher cash and investment balances in the fourth quarter of we also received   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded these amounts as other income in each year 
we expect income from government grants to decrease in the future with the final receipt of funding from our national consortium drug discovery group grant award from the national cancer institute in interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other expense in  and was primarily the result of reduced equipment loan obligations 
conversion expense on june   we sold  in series d zero coupon convertible debentures and a warrant to purchase  shares of geron common stock to an institutional investor 
we recognized  in interest expense with an offset to additional paid in capital for the black scholes calculated value of the warrant issued with the convertible debentures 
in december  we recognized an additional  in imputed non cash interest expense related to the beneficial conversion feature of the series d convertible debentures as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  with an offset to additional paid in capital 
in november  we modified the terms of  of outstanding series d convertible debentures and converted the debentures into  shares of geron common stock 
the remaining  of outstanding series d convertible debentures was modified to extend the maturity date to june   increase the yield on the debenture to  and fix the conversion price at per share 
the related warrant was split into two warrants 
the series d warrant to purchase  shares of geron common stock had an exercise price of per share and an exercise period to june  the series d warrant to purchase  shares of geron common stock had an exercise price of per share and an exercise period to december  as a result of this modification  we recorded  in conversion expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
in may  we modified the existing terms of the outstanding  of series d convertible debentures to provide for an automatic conversion into equity on the maturity date  fixed the conversion price at per share and eliminated the interest accrual for the remainder of the term 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related outstanding warrants and changed the exercise prices to per share 
the expiration periods were unchanged 
as a result of this second modification  we recorded  in conversion expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
during may and june  all of the remaining  of series d convertible debentures plus accrued interest of  were converted into  shares of geron common stock 
as of december  and  no series d convertible debentures remained outstanding 
amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock expired on july  without having been exercised and amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock remained outstanding as of december  net loss net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the overall increase in net loss in compared to was primarily the result of the acquired in process research technology expense of million associated with the merix transaction and increased research and development expense associated with the clinical development of grnl 
the decrease in net loss in compared to was the net result of reduced revenues partially offset by decreased operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper  asset backed securities and municipal securities 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the result of an equity financing consummated in november which resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the result of two equity financings in which resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in net cash used for operations in was primarily the result of increased operating expenses related to the manufacturing and development of grnl 
the decrease in net cash used in operations in was due to reduced operating expenses  primarily the result of the restructuring announced in january cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in and reflected the purchase of marketable securities from proceeds received through various equity financings as described below 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and was the result of maturities of marketable securities 
through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through an equipment financing arrangement 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total  and  in and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our equipment financing facilities 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facilities expires on september  we intend to renew the commitment for new equipment financing facilities in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  we will be obliged to use our own cash resources for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily the result of the sale  shares of geron common stock to institutional investors at per share  for net cash proceeds of approximately million in november in connection with the sale  we also issued warrants with a sixty day exercise period to purchase  shares at per share  and longer term warrants  exercisable after days  to purchase  shares at a premium 
in january  we received an additional million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to these institutional investors 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million reflected the receipt of net proceeds of approximately million from the completion of a public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option and the sale of  shares of common stock to two investors at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities in of  was primarily the result of principal payments under our capital leases and equipment loans 
our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter are as follows principal payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years amounts in thousands equipment loans operating leases research funding total contractual cash obligations this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
in march  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at and constitution drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from february  through july  the fair value of the common stock has been recorded as a prepaid asset and will be amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period 
research funding is comprised of sponsored research commitments at various academic laboratories around the world  including the roslin institute 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facilities will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least december changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities with three financial institutions in the united states 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore  bear minimal risk 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of marketable securities 
marketable securities consist of high grade corporate bonds  asset backed securities and us government agency securities 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of asset backed securities which have varying maturity dates  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million in long term investments which are due in one to two years 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate notes  asset backed securities and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
for the year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  our financial obligations to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next months 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pounds sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
