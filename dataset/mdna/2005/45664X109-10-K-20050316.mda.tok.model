year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net income to common stockholders increased by  from a loss of  for to income of  for on higher revenues 
for  the results of operations include sms  ihs  and other acquisitions completed in for the year ended december  the current year  revenues increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the prior year 
approximately  of this growth is attributable to revenue from clients added as the result of acquisitions completed in the remainder of approximately  represents organic growth  of which  was the result of new customer contracts while the remaining increase resulted from increased revenues from existing clients 
costs of revenues increased by  to  during the current year compared with  for the prior year 
the increase results from the expansion of revenues from both acquisitions and organic growth 
costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to in the current year from in the prior year  reflecting a lower gross margin 
we had expected our gross margin to decline after the sms acquisition until its operations could be consolidated into our existing operating infrastructure 
the integration of sms was completed in early march gross margin improved from in the third quarter ended september  to in the fourth quarter ended december  this improvement reflects the inclusion of ihs  which contributed of our fourth quarter gross margin 
our infrastructure provides a shared operating environment that enables us to effectively integrate new clients  including clients acquired through acquisitions 
we expect our gross margin to improve as the integration of ihs progresses 
due to higher compensation costs in the current year  selling and promotion costs increased by  to  for the current year from  for the prior year  but decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the current year from for the prior year 
higher compensation costs reflect a larger sales staff in the current year than in the prior year 
the reduction as a percentage of revenue reflects the benefits of integration of the acquired businesses 
page general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the current year from  for the prior year 
general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue to in the current year from in the prior year  reflecting the benefits of operational leverage and consolidation of the acquired businesses 
approximately  or of the total increase  was related to acquisitions completed in approximately  of the total increase was due to professional fees relating to compliance costs with respect to the sarbanes oxley act of also  an additional  of professional fees was incurred  and salary costs were approximately  higher than in the prior period 
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and other intangibles increased  to  for the current year from  for the prior year 
of this increase   of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of other intangibles was related to acquisitions in the current year 
the remainder of the increase of  resulted from new fixed asset additions totaling approximately  during the current year 
despite these increases  depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenues to in the current year compared with in the prior year 
net interest expense increased by  to  for the current year from  for the prior year 
this net increase consists of  in additional interest income   in additional interest expense  and  of deferred financing costs which were expensed upon the prepayment of term loans of approximately million in june the increases in interest income and expense are due to larger average outstanding balances of both cash and outstanding debt  respectively  in the current year 
interest expense on the convertible debt in the current year  including amortization of deferred financing costs and discount  amounted to  a deferred tax benefit reflects future income tax savings realizable when tax credits  net operating loss carry forwards  or other deductions based on temporary differences between taxable income and income before income taxes can be used to reduce income taxes 
if there is uncertainty of realizing deferred tax benefits  a valuation allowance must be established 
we had a deferred tax valuation allowance of  at the end of the prior year 
for the current year  we recorded a tax benefit of  compared with a tax provision of  which represented estimated state income taxes  for the prior year 
this change is due to a decrease of  in deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter ended december  to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management  more likely than not  to be realized 
based on our recent history of profitability and our forecasts for future periods  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences will be realized 
we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in the use of these net operating loss carry forwards may be limited in amount in future years pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
due to a lack of sms s history of generating taxable income  we recorded a valuation allowance equal to of their net deferred tax assets 
in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings from sms in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase goodwill in the period that such determination is made 
we have net income of  for the current year compared with  for the prior year 
net loss to common stockholders after accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock was  for the prior year 
we redeemed the preferred stock in october the net loss to common stockholders included non cash charges for accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock of  in the prior year 
in the current year  we had income per common share of on a basic basis and on a diluted basis  compared with a loss of per share for the prior year  on both a basic and diluted basis 
the number of weighted average shares increased to approximately  shares on a basic basis and approximately  shares on a diluted basis in the current year from approximately  shares on both a basic and diluted basis for the prior year 
the increase in shares reflects i private placements of a  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in october and b  shares of common stock in march  ii the potential conversion of  of convertible notes due july   which were issued during  into  shares of common stock  and iii the issuance of  shares of common stock for acquisitions during the shares and equivalents enumerated in the immediately preceding sentence are in absolute amounts  not weighted average amounts 
common stock equivalents are excluded in determining the net income or loss per share when the inclusion of such equivalents would be antidilutive 
page year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  certain reclassifications were made to the and financial statements to conform to the current year presentation 
for the year ended december   revenues increased  to  from  for the year ended december  
revenues from amquest  which had only months of operations in  contributed  of this increase 
revenues grew by  excluding growth contributed by amquest 
this organic revenue growth was net of a decline in the revenue from our largest client  adt security services  inc revenues from this significant customer were  in compared with  in  representing and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the decrease in revenue from this customer reflects the impact of special processing provided in  but not in other organic revenue growth totaled 
costs of revenues increased  to  of revenues during compared with  of revenues for costs of revenues in reflect the benefit from the settlement with a software licensor described below 
without the benefit of that settlement  costs of revenues in would have been  of revenues 
the improvement in margin is related to the successful integration of the amquest operations 
in january  we settled a dispute of claims with a software licensor 
pursuant to the settlement  we received credits totaling  to be used toward future purchases the credits 
the entire value of the credits was recorded in and as of december   all the credits had been applied against certain software license fees 
additionally  we reversed accrued expenses of  for software support and maintenance fees in in connection with the settlement of the dispute 
selling and promotion costs increased due to higher compensation costs by  to  for from  for  but decreased as a percentage of revenues to from in general and administrative expenses decreased  to  for from  for contributing to the improvement was a reduction of  in provision for bonuses and  in salary cost reductions  as well as a reduction of  in provision for doubtful accounts 
depreciation and amortization for fixed assets and other intangibles rose   to  for from  for we recorded net interest expense of  in  compared with  in the net increase of  reflects i a decrease in interest income of  from a lower average balance of interest earning assets during and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates  and ii an increase of  in interest expense on a larger average outstanding debt balance than in in february  we issued  of senior subordinated debentures the debentures in connection with the amquest acquisition  bearing interest at an effective rate of 
we took advantage of a provision of the debentures and paid the interest payments due july  february and july by issuing a total of  in additional debentures  which bore the same effective interest rate 
in october we repaid the debentures and additional debentures from the proceeds of a private offering of common stock 
also in october  in connection with the redemption of all outstanding redeemable preferred stock  we issued  of five year term loans 
amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of the debenture discount also contributed to the increased interest expense in in  we recorded income tax expense of  representing estimated state income taxes 
in  a net income tax benefit of  was recorded  representing the carryback of  of federal income tax credits net of estimated state income tax expense of  cumulative pre tax losses that cannot be carried back can be carried forward for a period of taxable years for federal income tax purposes 
we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in the use of these net operating loss carry forwards may be limited in amount in future years pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the deferred tax asset associated with carrying forward cumulative pre tax losses has been fully offset by a valuation allowance in due to the uncertainty of realizing such tax benefits 
page we have net income of  for compared with  for net loss to common stockholders after accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock was  for compared with a net loss of  for the net loss to common stockholders included a decrease in non cash charges for accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock of  to  in from  in the loss per common share was for compared with a loss per common share of in  on both a basic and diluted basis

accounts receivable also increased by  as a result of operating activity during this increase included  related to ihs  the collection of which was delayed due to the transition of accounts payable processing by certain of the ihs customers 
these receivables were collected subsequent to year end

as of december   we had cash and equivalents of  on february   we filed a preliminary  or shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement will permit us to sell equity or debt securities  in any combination  for up to  we intend to use the net proceeds we expect to receive from the sale of the securities to reduce our outstanding debt and to fund possible acquisitions and investments 
the exact timing and terms of this financing will depend upon market conditions and other factors 
there can be no assurance that such financing will occur 
we believe that our cash and equivalents  current assets  and cash generated from future operating activities will provide adequate resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to obtain additional financing to fund significant acquisitions or other substantial investments 
ebitda ebitda represents net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we present ebitda because we consider such information an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to us  many of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
we also use ebitda as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
our credit agreement uses ebitda with additional adjustments to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurred 
ebitda is also used by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with us 
in addition  ebitda is also widely used by us and other buyers to evaluate and determine the price of potential acquisition candidates 
for the year ended december   our ebitda was  compared to  for the year ended december  ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a principal indicator of our performance 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only on a supplemental basis 
page the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the current and prior year 
reconciliation in thousands year ended december  net income   add back deduct tax expense benefit  interest expense   depreciation and amortization   ebitda   ebitda is a measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income loss from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the selection and application of significant accounting policies  and which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition our services are provided under a combination of fixed monthly fees and time and materials billings 
contracts with customers typically range from two to seven years 
revenue is recognized after we have obtained an executed service contract from the customer  as the services are rendered  when the price is fixed as per the service contract  and when we believe that collectibility is reasonably assured  based on our credit risk policies and procedures that we employ 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining these allowances  we evaluate a number of factors  including the credit risk of customers  historical trends  and other relevant information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
business combinations our current acquisitions and future acquisitions of businesses that we will control will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions will be based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as goodwill 
the fair values will be determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information will include valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations will generally be based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by management and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
page goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions include customer lists  customer relationships  property and equipment and goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
however  we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which will then be compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
the implied fair value of reporting unit will be determined by our management and will generally be based upon future cash flow projections for the reporting unit  discounted to present value 
we will use outside valuation experts when management considers that it would be appropriate to do so 
intangibles subject to amortization  including customer lists and customer relationships  are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
we take into consideration the history of contract renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we analyze our customer lists on a case by case basis  with examination of the history of contract renewals as well as other factors  such as material changes to contract terms or significant new commitments where applicable 
such estimates are based on management s judgment of its current relationship with the relevant customers and its estimate of future economic 
changes to either of these factors could result in an impairment charge  which could have a material effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
customer relationships are essential to our business 
in determining the value of these relationships  we discounted the expected returns for each contract using a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining terms of the contract 
we further estimate that it would be unlikely that a customer would terminate its contract  due to the quality of service currently provided as well as the lack of viable alternatives 
property and equipment are initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset is expected to remain in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we will review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they may have changed from our initial assessment 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
page we will perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in the long lived assets physical condition 
when indicators of impairment are present  management determines whether the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the estimates of both the undiscounted future cash flows and the fair values of assets require the use of complex models which require numerous highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
deferred taxes our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
a tax valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount for which recovery is probable 
based on our profitability in and our forecasts  we have determined it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences will be realized 
accordingly  we released the full valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of due to a lack of a history of generating taxable income on sms  we recorded a valuation allowance equal to of its net deferred tax assets 
in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings from sms in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase goodwill in the period that such determination was made 
stock based compensation to date  we have accounted for stock based compensation by using the intrinsic value based method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  we have only recorded compensation expense for any stock options granted with an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
refer to the section entitled recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of the impact of the recently issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  on our recording of stock based compensation for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which eliminated the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  shared based payment  which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 
sfas r will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  page sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of the following two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all shared based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fasb for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under fasb for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt fasb r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by fasb  we currently account for shared based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fasb as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have not determined what impact sfas r might have on the nature of our shared based compensation to employees in the future
