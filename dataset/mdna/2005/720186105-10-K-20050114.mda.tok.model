item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our operations 
piedmont natural gas company is an energy services company primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers in portions of north carolina  south carolina and tennessee 
we also have equity method investments in joint venture  energy related businesses 
our operations are comprised of two business segments 
the regulated utility segment is the largest segment of our business and is regulated by three state regulatory commissions 
the regulatory commissions approve rates that are designed to give us the opportunity to generate revenues  assuming normal weather  to cover our gas costs and fixed and variable non gas costs and to earn a fair rate of return for our shareholders 
the regulated utility is weather sensitive and faces competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customer preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products and the relative prices of those products 
the regulated utility faces competition in the industrial market as many of our customers have the capability of burning a fuel other than natural gas 
fuel oil is the most significant competing energy alternative for such customers 
our ability to maintain industrial market share is largely dependent on price 
the non utility activities segment consists of our equity method investments in joint venture  energy related businesses that are involved  as of october   in unregulated retail natural gas marketing  interstate natural gas storage and intrastate natural gas transportation 
key items in fiscal net income increased to million and diluted earnings per share increased to per share 
a two for one stock split was effective on october  in september  we implemented a common stock repurchase program 
we completed the permanent financing of the acquisitions of north carolina natural gas corporation ncng and a equity interest in eastern north carolina natural gas company easternnc through the sale of long term debt and common stock 
the acquisitions were originally financed with commercial paper 
we began a continuous business process improvement cbpi program that analyzed key areas of our business to identify and implement improvements to increase revenues  to reduce costs and to better serve customers 
we began to reorganize our customer service delivery system to enhance operational efficiency and to improve customer satisfaction 
we refocused our non utility activities segment by completing the sale of our interests in us propane  lp  and the proposed greenbrier pipeline project 
we established a charitable foundation with an initial funding commitment of million 
results of operations operating results for reflect the full effect of the acquisitions of ncng and an equity interest in easternnc on september  net income was million in  million in and million in as more fully explained in this section  the net income increase of million in compared with was primarily due to the following million increase in margin operating revenues less cost of gas 
million increase in income from equity method investments 
million gain on the sale of our equity method investment in propane 
these increases were partially offset by the following million increase in operations and maintenance expenses 
million increase in depreciation expense 
million increase in charitable contributions 
million increase in interest on long term debt 
million increase in general taxes 
the net income increase of million in compared with was primarily due to an increase of million in margin  partially offset by increases of million in operations and maintenance expenses and million in depreciation expense

million from the wna due to charges of million in compared with credits of million in  excluding the impact of wna for ncng 
million from increased customer rates and charges  including changes in rate design  in tennessee  effective november  excluding ncng  volumes decreased million dekatherms primarily due to warmer weather 
this decrease resulted in a decrease in operating revenues of million 
operating revenues in increased million compared with primarily due to the following increases million from increased volumes due to colder weather and growth in our customer base  including million from customers acquired in the purchase of north carolina gas service ncgs in september volumes increased million dekatherms primarily due to colder weather

see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
million from increased customer rates and charges  including changes in rate design  in north carolina and south carolina  effective november  million from customers acquired in the ncng acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by million in wna credits in compared with charges of million in  a net decrease in operating revenues of million 
in general rate proceedings  state regulatory commissions have authorized us to recover a margin  applicable rate less cost of gas  on each unit of gas delivered 
the commissions have also authorized us to recover margin losses resulting from negotiating lower rates to industrial customers when necessary to remain competitive 
the ability to recover such negotiated margin reductions is subject to continuing regulatory approvals 
cost of gas was  million in  million in and million in cost of gas in increased million compared with primarily due to the following increases million from the increase in volumes from ncng customers

these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million to defer to a regulatory asset easternnc s operations and maintenance costs that were expensed prior to september  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation expense increased from million to million over the three year period to primarily due to increases in plant in service  including a full year of depreciation expense in compared with only one month in on plant acquired from ncng 
due to the continued growth in our service areas and our commitment to capital expansion  we anticipate that depreciation expense will continue to increase

our business piedmont natural gas company  inc  which began operations in  is an energy services company primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas to  residential  commercial and industrial customers in portions of north carolina  south carolina and tennessee  including  customers served by municipalities who are our wholesale customers 
we are invested in joint venture  energy related businesses  including  as of october   unregulated retail natural gas marketing  interstate natural gas storage  intrastate natural gas transportation and regulated natural gas distribution 
we also sell residential and commercial gas appliances in tennessee 
in  our predecessor  which was incorporated in under the same name  was merged into a newly formed north carolina corporation for the purpose of changing our state of incorporation to north carolina 
effective september   we purchased for million in cash substantially all of the natural gas distribution assets and certain of the liabilities of ncgs  a division of nui utilities  inc the transaction added  customers to our distribution system in the counties of rockingham and stokes  north carolina 
effective at the close of business on september   we purchased of the common stock of ncng from progress energy  inc progress  for million in cash plus million for estimated working capital 
we paid an additional 
million for actual working capital in our second quarter ended april  ncng  a regulated natural gas distribution company  served  customers in eastern north carolina  including  customers served by four municipalities who were wholesale customers of ncng 
ncng was merged into piedmont immediately following the closing 
we also purchased for million in cash progress equity interest in easternnc 
easternnc is a regulated utility that has a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide natural gas service to counties in eastern north carolina that previously were not served with natural gas 
progress equity interest in easternnc consisted of of easternnc s outstanding common stock and of easternnc s outstanding preferred stock 
we are obligated to purchase additional authorized but unissued shares of such preferred stock for million 
we have two reportable business segments  regulated utility and non utility activities 
for further information on business segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our utility operations are subject to regulation by the north carolina utilities commission ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina pscsc and the tennessee regulatory authority tra as to rates  service area  adequacy of service  safety standards  extensions and abandonment of facilities  accounting and depreciation 
we are also subject to regulation by the ncuc as to the issuance of securities 
we are also subject to or affected by various federal regulations 
these federal regulations include regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry  such as regulations of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that affect the availability of and the prices paid for the interstate transportation of natural gas  regulations of the department of transportation that affect the construction  operation  maintenance  integrity and safety of natural gas distribution systems and regulations of the environmental protection agency relating to the use and release into the environment of hazardous wastes 
in addition  we are subject to numerous regulations  such as those relating to employment practices  that are generally applicable to companies doing business in the united states of america 
in the carolinas  our service area is comprised of numerous cities  towns and communities including anderson  greenville and spartanburg in south carolina and charlotte  salisbury  greensboro  winston salem  high point  burlington  hickory  spruce pine  reidsville  fayetteville  new bern  wilmington  tarboro  elizabeth city  rockingham and goldsboro in north carolina 
in north carolina  we also provide wholesale natural gas service to greenville  monroe  rocky mount and wilson 
in tennessee  our service area is the metropolitan area of nashville  including wholesale natural gas service to gallatin and smyrna 
we continually assess the nature of our business and explore alternatives to traditional utility regulation 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services provide additional challenges and opportunities for us 
for further information  see results of operations above and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we invest in joint ventures to complement or supplement income from utility operations 
if an opportunity aligns with our overall business strategies  we analyze and evaluate the project with a major factor being a projected rate of return greater than the returns allowed in our utility operations  due to the higher risk of such projects 
we make only those investments that are approved by the board of directors 
we participate in the governance of the venture by having a management representative on the governing board of the venture 
we monitor actual performance and rates of return against expectations and make periodic reports to the board 
decisions regarding exiting joint ventures are based on many factors  including performance results and continued alignment with our business strategies 
financial condition and liquidity we believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for working capital  construction expenditures  debt redemptions and dividend payments 
these resources include net cash flow from operating activities  access to capital markets  investments in non utility activities and bank lines of credit 
cash flows from operating activities 
the natural gas business is seasonal in nature 
operating cash flows may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to such factors as weather  natural gas prices  the timing of collections from customers  natural gas purchases and gas inventory storage activity 
we rely on operating cash flows and short term bank borrowings to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs 
during the first and second quarters  we generally have positive cash flows from the sale of flowing gas and gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable from customers 
this cash is used to reduce short term debt to zero during much of the second and third quarters 
most of our annual earnings are realized in the winter period  which is the first five months of our fiscal year 
cash requirements generally increase during the third and fourth quarters due to increases in accounts payable for natural gas purchases for storage and decreases in collections of accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the primary factor that impacts our cash flows from operations is weather 
warmer weather can lead to lower total margin from fewer volumes of natural gas sold or transported 
colder weather can increase volumes sold to weather sensitive customers  but extremely cold weather may lead to conservation by customers in order to reduce their consumption 
weather outside the normal range of temperatures can lead to reduced operating cash flows  thereby increasing the need for short term borrowings to meet current cash requirements 
during  of our sales and transportation revenues were from residential customers and were from commercial customers  both of which are weather sensitive 
our regulatory commissions approve rates that are designed to give us the opportunity to generate revenues  assuming normal weather  to cover our gas costs and fixed and variable non gas costs and to earn a fair return for our shareholders 
we have weather normalization adjustment mechanisms wna in all three states that partially offset the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on bills rendered in november through march for weather sensitive customers 
weather in was warmer than normal  compared with colder than normal in and warmer than normal in the wna generated charges to customers of million in  credits to customers of million in and charges to customers of million in in north carolina and tennessee  adjustments are made directly to the customer s bill 
in south carolina  the adjustments are calculated at the individual customer level and recorded in a deferred account for subsequent collection from or disbursement to all customers in the class 
the wna formula calculates the actual weather variance from normal  using years of history  which results in an increase in revenues when weather is warmer than normal and a decrease in revenues when weather is colder than normal 
the gas cost portion of our costs is recoverable through purchased gas adjustment pga procedures and is not affected by the wna 
the financial condition of the natural gas marketers and pipelines that supply and deliver natural gas to our distribution system can increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
we believe our risk exposure to the financial condition of the marketers and pipelines is minimal based on our receipt of the products and other services prior to payment and the availability of other marketers of natural gas to meet our supply needs if necessary 
the regulated utility faces competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customer preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products and the relative prices of those products 
the most significant product competition is with electricity for space heating  water heating and cooking 
increases in the price of natural gas can negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer 
this can impact our cash needs if customer growth slows  resulting in reduced capital expenditures  or if customers conserve  resulting in reduced billings and gas purchases 
in the industrial market  many of our customers have the capability of burning a fuel other than natural gas  fuel oil being the most significant competing energy alternative 
our ability to maintain industrial market share is largely dependent on price 
the relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of natural gas 
with the imbalance between domestic supply and demand  the cost of natural gas from non domestic sources may play a greater role in establishing the future market price of natural gas 
the price of oil depends upon a number of factors beyond our control  including the relationship between supply and demand and the policies of foreign and domestic governments 
our liquidity could be impacted  either positively or negatively  as a result of alternate fuel decisions by industrial customers 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash used in investing activities for was primarily due to utility construction expenditures 
gross utility construction expenditures were million million net of afudc  contributions in aid of construction and bond reimbursements for easternnc s expenditures 
as expenditures are made in easternnc s service territory  reimbursement requests are made to the state of north carolina under orders issued by the ncuc granting easternnc a total of million of bond funds 
such funds are available to pay for the uneconomic portion of the construction of a natural gas distribution infrastructure in the eastern part of the state 
for further information about the bond fund  see gas supply and regulatory proceedings below 
we have a substantial capital expansion program for construction of distribution facilities  purchase of equipment and other general improvements 
the capital expansion program supports the growth in our customer base 
net utility construction expenditures in were million  compared with million in and million in gross utility construction expenditures totaling million  primarily to serve customer growth  are budgeted for  however  we are not contractually obligated to expend capital until the work is completed 
due to projected growth in our service areas  significant utility construction expenditures are expected to continue and are a part of our long range forecast 
our equity interest in easternnc consists of of easternnc s outstanding common stock and of easternnc s preferred stock 
we are obligated to purchase additional authorized but unissued shares of such preferred stock for million 
we are in the process of selling our corporate office building located in charlotte  north carolina 
we have negotiated a preliminary ten year lease with renewable options for space in a building that is currently under construction and anticipated to be ready for occupancy in late the lease payments for the ten year term are estimated to range from million to million annually 
we expect to lease back our current office building prior to occupancy of the new office space 
we received million from the sale of equity method investments in  million from our investment in us propane  lp  and million from our investment in greenbrier pipeline company  llc 
we received million in capital distributions from our equity method investments in  compared with million in and million in we regularly evaluate the performance of the non utility activities segment based on earnings from the ventures and the return on our investments in the ventures 
pending various governmental approvals  we intend to jointly develop an underground interstate natural gas storage facility in west virginia with columbia hardy corporation  a subsidiary of columbia gas transmission corporation 
total project capital expenditures are estimated at to million over a five year period 
for further information  see equity method investments below 
in  we acquired of the common stock of ncng and a equity interest in easternnc from progress 
in  we acquired substantially all of the natural gas distribution assets and certain liabilities of ncgs  a division of nui utilities  inc these acquisitions were a part of our focus on growing our core utility business 
for further information regarding the acquisitions  see note e and note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in funds are generally provided from bank borrowings and the issuance of common stock through dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans 
when required  we sell common stock and long term debt to cover cash requirements when market and other conditions favor such long term financing 
as of october   our current assets were million and our current liabilities were million 
under committed bank lines of credit totaling million  outstanding short term borrowings during ranged from zero to million  and interest rates ranged from to 
as of october   we had additional uncommitted lines of credit totaling million on a no fee and as needed  if available  basis 
in addition to these bank lines of credit  we had a commercial paper program where we could issue up to million in unsecured promissory notes that were backed by a million credit agreement scheduled to expire june  this program was put in place to provide for the temporary financing of our acquisitions of ncng and the equity interest in easternnc 
the notes issued under this program on september   were sold at a discount from face values at libor cost plus rates  with maturities ranging from one to days 
on december   we repaid million of commercial paper with the proceeds from the sale of million of medium term notes 
on january   we sold million shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share million shares at on a pre split basis 
the proceeds of million  net of underwriting discount  were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper 
on january   we repaid the balance of million of the outstanding commercial paper from internally generated cash  and the program was terminated 
the level of short term borrowings can vary significantly due to changes in the wholesale prices of natural gas and to increased purchases of natural gas supplies to serve customer demand and to refill storage 
short term debt may increase when wholesale prices for natural gas increase because we must pay suppliers for the gas before we recover our costs from customers through their monthly bills 
gas prices could continue to fluctuate due to the relationship between domestic supply and demand 
if wholesale gas prices remain high  we may incur more short term debt to pay for natural gas supplies and other operating costs since collections from customers could be slower and some customers may not be able to pay their gas bills on a timely basis 
during  we issued million of common stock through dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
under the common stock open market purchase program discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we repurchased in our fourth quarter ended october   
million shares of common stock that are available for reissuance to these plans 
in june  we made the remaining scheduled sinking fund payment of million on the senior notes 
we increased our common stock dividend on an annualized basis by 
per share in  and dividends of million  million and million for  and  respectively  were paid on common stock 
the amount of cash dividends that may be paid on common stock is restricted by provisions contained in certain note agreements under which long term debt was issued  however  as of october   none of our retained earnings were restricted 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of october   our capitalization consisted of in long term debt and in common equity 
our long term targeted capitalization ratio is in long term debt and in common equity 
as of october   all of our long term debt was unsecured 
our long term debt is rated a by standard poor s ratings services and a by moody s investors 
credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short term and long term financing and the cost of such financings 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider various factors 
the more significant quantitative factors include ratio of total debt to total capitalization  including balance sheet leverage  ratio of net cash flows to capital expenditures  funds from operations interest coverage  ratio of funds from operations to average total debt  and pre tax interest coverage 
qualitative factors include  among other things stability of regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate  risks and controls inherent in the distribution of natural gas  predictability of cash flows  business strategy and management  corporate governance guidelines and practices  industry position  and contingencies 
we are subject to default provisions related to our long term debt and short term bank lines of credit 
the default provisions of our senior notes are failure to make principal  interest or sinking fund payments  interest coverage of times  total debt cannot exceed of total capitalization  funded debt of all subsidiaries in the aggregate cannot exceed of total company capitalization  failure to make payments on any capitalized lease obligation  bankruptcy  liquidation or insolvency  and final judgment against us in excess of million that after days is not discharged  satisfied or stayed pending appeal 
the default provisions of our medium term notes are failure to make principal  interest or sinking fund payments  failure after the receipt of a day notice to observe or perform for any covenant or agreement in the notes or in the indenture under which the notes were issued  and bankruptcy  liquidation or insolvency 
failure to satisfy any of the default provisions would result in total outstanding issues of debt becoming due 
there are cross default provisions in all our debt agreements 
as of october   we are in compliance with all default provisions 
as of october   our estimated future contractual obligations were as follows 
payments due by period less than after in thousands year years years years total long term debt interest on long term debt easternnc preferred stock pipeline and storage capacity gas supply telecommunications and information technology operating leases charitable foundation other purchase obligations for further detail on long term debt  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
presented as current  however  there is no timeframe specified in the acquisition documents 
recoverable through purchased gas adjustment pga procedures 
reservation fees that are recoverable through pga procedures 
consists primarily of maintenance fees for hardware and software applications  usage fees  local and long distance data costs  frame relay  cell phone and pager usage fees and contract labor and consulting fees 
excludes amounts due for new corporate office space pending the negotiation of the final lease and the completion of the building 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
consists primarily of pipeline products  vehicles  contractors and merchandise 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases that are reflected in the table above and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other relevant factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions and make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current information if we determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are warranted 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or a different estimate that could have been used would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we consider regulatory accounting  revenue recognition  goodwill and pension and postretirement benefits to be our critical accounting estimates 
management and our independent auditors have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates presented below with the audit committee of the board of directors 
regulatory accounting 
our regulated utility segment is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
our accounting policies conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation statement  and are in accordance with accounting requirements and ratemaking practices prescribed by the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows us to defer expenses and revenues in the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when those expenses and revenues will be allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
we then recognize these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
if we  for any reason  cease to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of our operations  we would eliminate from the balance sheet the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria and include them in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such an event could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period this action was recorded 
regulatory assets as of october  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
regulatory liabilities as of october  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
the detail of these regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
utility sales and transportation revenues are based on rates approved by state regulatory commissions 
base rates charged to customers may not be changed without formal approval by the regulatory commission in that jurisdiction  however  the wholesale cost of gas component of rates may be adjusted periodically under pga procedures 
a wna factor  based on the margin or base rate component of the billing rate  is included in rates charged to residential and commercial customers during the winter period of november through march in all jurisdictions except easternnc 
the wna is designed to offset the impact that unusually cold or warm weather has on customer billings during the winter season 
without the wna  our operating revenues in would have been lower by million 
revenues are recognized monthly on the accrual basis  which includes estimated amounts for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method from the last meter reading date to month end 
meters are read throughout the month based on an approximate day usage cycle  therefore  at any point in time  volumes are delivered to customers that have not been metered and billed 
the unbilled revenue estimate reflects factors requiring judgment related to estimated usage by customer class  changes in weather during the period and the impact of the wna 
prior to  we recognized revenues from meters read on a monthly cycle basis and deferred the cost of gas for volumes delivered but not yet billed 
secondary market  or wholesale  sales revenues are recognized when the physical sales are delivered based on the contracted or market prices 
goodwill 
all of our goodwill is attributable to the regulated utility segment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a weighted average of the guideline company method of the market approach and the discounted cash flow method of the income approach on the premise of continued use  which assumes that a buyer and seller contemplate the continued use of the reporting unit at its present location as part of current and future operations 
the guideline company method of the market approach is based on market multiples of companies that are representative of our peers in the natural gas distribution industry 
the discounted cash flow method of the income approach consists of estimating annual future cash flows and individually discounting them back to the present value 
these calculations are dependent on several subjective factors  including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
the calculations also define the reporting unit as the domestic natural gas distribution business 
an impairment charge would be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded its fair value 
through october   no impairment has been recognized 
using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions and continued cash flows 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the weighted average cost of capital would have the following effects 
in thousands basis point increase basis point decrease change in fair value of the regulated utility segment the basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would not have required the recording of an impairment charge 
pension and postretirement benefits 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of eligible full time employees 
we also provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible full time employees 
our reported costs of providing these benefits  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are impacted by numerous factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics and various actuarial calculations  assumptions and accounting mechanisms 
because of the complexity of these calculations  the long term nature of these obligations and the importance of the assumptions used  our estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations  projected health care cost trend rates  expected long term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate projected benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is determined by developing a hypothetical bond portfolio matching our projected benefit cost with our projected benefit obligations 
based on market trends  we reduced the discount rate to in from in and in based on our review of actual cost trend rates and projected future trends in establishing health care cost trend rates  we changed our health care cost trend rate from in to in and in  declining gradually to in for participants aged less than for participants aged greater than  we changed our health care cost trend rate from in to in and in  declining gradually to by in determining our expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we review past long term performance  asset allocations and long term inflation assumptions 
we target our asset allocation for pension plan assets to be approximately equity securities and fixed income securities 
the target allocation for our other postretirement benefit assets is also equity securities and fixed income securities 
based on market trends  we reduced the expected long term rate of return of plan assets from in to in and based on a fairly stagnant inflation trend  our assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels has remained at from to the following reflects the sensitivity of pension cost in certain actuarial assumptions  assuming that the other components of the calculation are constant 
in thousands change in impact on impact on projected actuarial assumption assumption pension cost benefit obligation increase decrease discount rate rate of return on plan assets 
n a rate of increase in compensation the following reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions  assuming that the other components of the calculation are constant 
impact on impact on accumulated in thousands change in postretirement postretirement actuarial assumption assumption benefit cost benefit obligation increase decrease health care cost trend rate rate of return on plan assets 
n a discount rate we utilize a number of accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension costs 
differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets 
if necessary  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees 
gas supply and regulatory proceedings in  the north carolina general assembly enacted the clean water and natural gas critical needs act of  which provided for the issuance of million of general obligation bonds of the state for the purpose of providing grants  loans or other financing for the cost of constructing natural gas facilities in unserved areas of the state 
easternnc is franchised to provide natural gas service to counties in the eastern most part of north carolina 
these counties historically have not been able to obtain gas service because of the relatively small population of the counties and the resulting uneconomic feasibility of providing service 
the ncuc has issued orders granting million of the bond fund to easternnc for construction of natural gas facilities in the counties 
during  we filed million for reimbursement from the bond fund and received million 
as of october   there was million remaining of the bond funds allocated to easternnc 
as of october  and  we had receivables of million and million  respectively  related to the bond fund recorded in receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
secondary market transactions permit us to market gas supplies and transportation services by contract with wholesale or off system customers 
these sales contribute smaller per unit wholesale margins to earnings  however  the program allows us to act as a wholesale marketer of natural gas and transportation capacity in order to generate operating margin from sources not restricted by the capacity of our retail distribution system 
in north carolina and south carolina  a sharing mechanism is in effect where of any margin earned is refunded to customers 
secondary market transactions in tennessee are included in the performance incentive plan discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
no general rate case activity is expected that would impact earnings in any of our jurisdictions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity method investments as of october   we owned of the membership interests in greenbrier pipeline company  llc greenbrier 
the other member was a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc greenbrier was formed to build a proposed interstate gas pipeline from west virginia to north carolina 
on november   we sold our interest in greenbrier to dominion resources for our book value of million 
on november   we  and a subsidiary of nisource inc  announced an agreement to form hardy storage company llc hardy storage  with each having a equity interest in the project 
hardy storage will seek approval from the ferc to construct  own and operate an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in hardy and hampshire counties  west virginia 
if approved  the facility will have the capacity to store approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas and deliver up to  dekatherms per day by november subject to obtaining all necessary approvals  construction is expected to begin in october with storage service commencing with initial injections in april total project capital expenditures are estimated at to million 
columbia gas transmission corporation  a subsidiary of nisource  will serve as operator of the facilities 
for additional information about our equity method investments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we have developed an internal environmental self assessment plan to assess our facilities and program areas for compliance with federal  state and local environmental regulations and to correct in a timely manner any deficiencies identified 
as a member of the north carolina mgp initiative group  we  along with other responsible parties  work directly with the north carolina department of environment and natural resources to set priorities for mgp site remediation 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec may contain forward looking statements 
in addition  our senior management and other authorized spokespersons may make forward looking statements in print or orally to analysts  investors  the media and others 
forward looking statements concern  among others  plans  objectives  proposed capital expenditures and future events or performance 
these statements reflect our current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ include regulatory issues  including those that affect allowed rates of return  terms and conditions of service  rate structures and financings 
we are impacted by regulation of the ncuc  the pscsc and the tra 
in addition  we purchase natural gas transportation and storage services from interstate and intrastate pipeline companies whose rates and services are regulated by the ferc and the ncuc  respectively 
residential  commercial and industrial growth in our service areas 
the ability to grow our customer base and the pace of that growth are impacted by general business and economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  fluctuations in the capital markets and the overall strength of the economy in our service areas and the country 
deregulation  unanticipated impacts of regulatory restructuring and competition in the energy industry 
we face competition from electric companies and energy marketing and trading companies and we expect this highly competitive environment to continue 
the potential loss of large volume industrial customers due to alternate fuels or to bypass or the shift by such customers to special competitive contracts at lower per unit margins 
regulatory issues  customer growth  deregulation  economic and capital market conditions  the cost and availability of natural gas and weather conditions can impact our ability to meet internal performance goals 
the capital intensive nature of our business 
in order to maintain our historic growth  we must add to our natural gas distribution system each year 
the cost of this construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining governmental approvals  development project delays or changes in project costs 
weather  general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost of a project 
our internally generated cash flows are not adequate to finance the full cost of this construction 
as a result  we must fund a portion of our cash needs through borrowings 
changes in the availability and cost of natural gas 
to meet firm customer requirements  we must acquire sufficient gas supplies and pipeline capacity to ensure delivery to our distribution system while also ensuring that our supply and capacity contracts allow us to remain competitive 
natural gas is an unregulated commodity market subject to supply and demand and price volatility 
we have a diversified portfolio of local peaking facilities  transportation and storage contracts with interstate pipelines and supply contracts with major producers and marketers to satisfy the supply and delivery requirements of our customers 
because these producers  marketers and pipelines are subject to operating and financial risks associated with exploring  drilling  producing  gathering  marketing and transporting natural gas  their risks also increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
we engage in hedging activities to reduce price volatility for our customers 
changes in weather conditions 
weather conditions and other natural phenomena can have a material impact on our earnings 
severe weather conditions can impact our suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to our distribution system 
extended mild or severe weather  either during the winter period or the summer period  can have a significant impact on the demand for and the cost of natural gas 
changes in environmental and safety regulations and the cost of compliance 
earnings from our equity method investments 
we invest in companies that engage in interstate natural gas storage  intrastate natural gas transportation and unregulated retail natural gas marketing 
these companies have risks that are inherent in their industries and we assume such risks as an equity investor 
all of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that these statements will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold all financial instruments discussed below for purposes other than trading 
we are potentially exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the cost of gas 
exposure to interest rate changes relates to both short and long term debt 
exposure to gas cost variations relates to the wholesale supply  demand and price for natural gas 
interest rate risk we have short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds 
the level of borrowings under such arrangements varies from period to period depending upon many factors  including our utility construction expenditures 
future short term interest expense and payments will be impacted by both short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
as of october   we had million of short term debt outstanding under committed bank lines of credit at a weighted average interest rate of 
the carrying amount of our short term debt approximates fair value 
during  such short term debt ranged from zero to million with interest rates from to 
we had a commercial paper program that was put into place to provide for the temporary financing of our acquisitions of ncng and the equity interest in easternnc in in december and january  the balance of the commercial paper was repaid from the net proceeds from issuing long term debt and common stock and from internally generated cash  and the program was terminated 
information as of october   about our long term debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates is presented below 
expected maturity date fair value as there of october in millions after total fixed rate long term debt average interest rate commodity price risk in the normal course of business  we utilize exchange traded contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of a portion of our natural gas requirements 
we manage our gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers and financial price hedging instruments 
due to cost based rate regulation in our utility operations  we have limited financial exposure to changes in commodity prices as substantially all changes in purchased gas costs and the costs of hedging our gas supplies are passed on to customers through pga mechanisms 
additional information concerning market risk is set forth in financial condition and liquidity in item of this form k
