item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the holding company s primary business is the operation of the bank 
the company s consolidated results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank additionally generates non interest income such as service charges and other fees  as well as income associated with the bank s purchase of bank owned life insurance boli 
non interest expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing fees  marketing expenses and other operating expenses 
the company s consolidated results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly fluctuations in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
the bank s primary strategy is to increase its household and deposit market shares in the communities which it serves  either through direct marketing  acquisitions or purchases of deposits 
the bank also seeks to increase its product and service utilization for each individual depositor 
in addition  the bank s primary strategy includes the origination of  and investment in  mortgage loans  with an emphasis on multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans  reflecting the fact that a significant portion of the housing in the bank s primary lending area is multifamily 
recently  the bank has increased its portfolio of loans secured by mixed use properties typically comprised of ground level commercial units and residential apartments on the upper floors 
the company believes that multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans provide advantages as investment assets 
initially  they offer a higher yield than investment securities of comparable maturities or terms to repricing 
origination and processing costs for the bank s multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans are lower per thousand dollars of originations than comparable one to four family loan costs 
in addition  the bank s market area has generally provided a stable flow of new and refinanced multifamily residential and commercial real estate loan originations 
in order to address the higher credit risk associated with multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending  the bank has developed underwriting standards that it believes are reliable in order to maintain consistent credit quality for its loans 
the bank also strives to provide a stable source of liquidity and earnings through the purchase of investment grade securities  seeks to maintain the asset quality of its loans and other investments  and uses appropriate portfolio and asset liability management techniques in an effort to manage the effects of interest rate volatility on its profitability and capital 
in  the company experienced modest growth in assets  primarily in mbs available for sale and commercial real estate loans secured by mixed use properties 
increases in real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of low interest rates during and  which were partially offset by an increase in principal repayments on loans and mbs resulting from increased customer refinance activities 
deposits grew in due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  primarily for cds and money market accounts 
prior to january  the overall low interest rate environment resulted in a greater decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities than the average yield on interest earning assets 
during the year ended december   the continued low interest rate environment created the opposite effect  resulting in a greater decline in the average yield on interest earning assets than in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  both an increase in short term interest rates during the latter part of the year ended december  and the coupon trust preferred borrowing issued by the company in march added to interest expense on borrowed funds during the year 
as a result  both the net interest spread and the net interest margin  which had increased during most of and  declined during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  also contributing to the decline in net income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a million decline in multifamily residential and commercial real estate loan prepayment fees 
the tightening of monetary policy by the fomc during the second half of resulted in a narrowing spread between short and long term interest rates  which negatively impacted the company s earnings during absent any future change in interest rates  the narrowing of spreads between long and short term interest rates is currently expected to negatively impact the company s earnings during the years ending december   and  since the company will experience a greater level of re pricing of interest bearing liabilities compared to interest earning assets 

see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest sensitivity gap 
management believes that by funding a large portion of its long term investments with core deposits  which have historically been less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than wholesale funding  the negative impact upon the company s future earnings that would otherwise result from the narrowing spread between short and long term interest rates  could be partially mitigated 
in addition  in the event that the spread between long and short term interest rates were to increase during the years ending december  and  the company has attempted to position itself to benefit from this occurrence by i not fully deploying its strong capital position during the low interest rate environments of and  and ii maintaining a short duration securities portfolio that is expected to provide a steady source of liquidity during and critical accounting policies various elements of the company s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
the company s policies with respect to the methodologies it uses to determine the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of msr and asset impairment judgments including the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and other than temporary declines in the value of securities  and loan income recognition are the company s most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  involve a high degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material variations in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the following is a description of the company s critical accounting policies and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
these policies and their application are reviewed periodically and at least annually with the audit committees of the holding company and the bank 
allowance for loan losses 
the loan loss reserve methodology consists of several key components  including a review of the two elements of the bank s loan portfolio  classified loans ie  non performing loans  troubled debt restructuring and impaired loans under amended sfas and performing loans 
at december   the majority of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to performing loans  which represented the overwhelming majority of the bank s loan portfolio 
performing loans are reviewed at least quarterly based upon the premise that there are losses inherent within the loan portfolio that have not been identified as of the date for which the review has been performed 
as a result  the bank calculates an allowance for loan losses related to its performing loans by deriving an expected loan loss percentage and applying it to its performing loans 
in deriving the expected loan loss percentage  the bank considers the following criteria the bank s historical loss experience  the age and payment history of the loans commonly referred to as their seasoned quality  the type of loan ie  one to four family  multifamily residential  commercial real estate  cooperative apartment  construction or consumer  the underwriting history of the loan ie  whether it was underwritten by the bank or a predecessor institution acquired subsequently by the bank and  therefore  originally subjected to different underwriting criteria  both the current condition and recent history of the overall local real estate market in order to determine the accuracy of utilizing recent historical charge off data to derive the expected loan loss percentages  the level of  and trend in  non performing loans  the level and composition of new loan activity  and the existence of geographic loan concentrations as the overwhelming majority of the bank s loans are secured by real estate properties located in the new york city metropolitan area or specific industry conditions within the portfolio segments 
since these criteria affect the expected loan loss percentages that are applied to performing loans  changes in any one of them will effect the amount of the allowance and the provision for loan losses 
the bank applied the process of determining the allowance for loan losses consistently throughout the years ended december  and loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful are reviewed individually on a quarterly basis by the loan loss reserve committee to determine if specific reserves are appropriate 
under the guidance established by amended sfas  loans determined to be impaired generally  non performing and troubled debt restructured multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans and non performing one to four family loans in excess of  are evaluated in order to establish whether the estimated value of the underlying collateral determined based upon an independent appraisal is sufficient to satisfy the existing debt 
for each loan that the bank determines to be impaired  impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying balance of the loan  including all accrued interest  exceeds the estimate of its fair value 
a specific reserve is established on all impaired loans to the extent of impairment and comprises a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
the loan loss reserve committee s determination of the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is subject to assumptions and judgments made by the committee 
a specific valuation allowance could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
the recorded investment in loans deemed impaired was approximately  consisting of two loans  at december  there were no loans considered impaired by the bank under amended sfas as of december  the largest single impaired loan at december   which possessed an outstanding principal balance of  was removed from impaired status in january the average total balance of impaired loans was approximately  during the year ended december    during the year ended december    during the six months ended december   and million during the year ended june  the increase in the average balance of impaired loans during the year ended december  resulted primarily from the addition of the two impaired loans totaling  during the period 
the decrease in both the current and average balance of impaired loans during the years ended december  and resulted from the repayment in june of an impaired million troubled debt restructured loan 
at december   reserves totaling  were allocated within the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans 
at december   there was no reserve allocated within the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans 
if approved by the board of directors  the bank will additionally increase its valuation allowance in an amount recommended by the loan loss reserve committee to appropriately reflect the anticipated loss from any other loss classification category 
typically  the bank s policy is to charge off immediately all balances classified loss and all charge offs are recorded as a reduction of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank applied this process consistently throughout the years ended december  and although management believes that the bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels  adjustments may be necessary if economic  market or other conditions in the future differ from the current operating environment 
although the bank believes it utilizes the most reliable information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate subject to significant judgment 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based upon objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
therefore  the company periodically reviews the actual performance and charge off of its portfolio and compares them to the previously determined allowance coverage percentages 
in doing so  the company evaluates the impact that the previously mentioned variables may have on the portfolio to determine whether or not changes should be made to the assumptions and analyses 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and the level of loans both in  and pending  foreclosure 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  the regulators may require the bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance 
valuation of msr 
the estimated origination and servicing costs of mortgage loans sold in which servicing rights are retained is allocated between the loans and the servicing rights based on their estimated fair values at the time of the loan sale 
servicing assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  net servicing income 
the estimated fair value of loan servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows  using assumptions of prepayments  defaults  servicing costs and discount rates that the company believes market participants would use for similar assets 
capitalized loan servicing assets are stratified based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans for the purpose of evaluating impairment 
a valuation allowance is then established in the event the recorded value of an individual stratum exceeds fair value 
all estimates and assumptions utilized in the valuation of the msr are derived based upon actual historical results for either the bank or its industry peers 
the fair value of msr is sensitive to changes in assumptions 
fluctuations in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msr 
in the event that loan prepayment activities increase due to increased loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely decline 
in the event that loan prepayment activities decrease due to a decline in loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely increase 
any measurement of msr is limited by the existing conditions and assumptions utilized at a particular point in time  and would not necessarily be appropriate if applied at a different point in time 
asset impairment adjustments 
certain of the company s assets are carried in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
management periodically performs analyses to test for impairment of these assets 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets 
in addition to the impairment analyses related to loans and msr discussed above  two other significant impairment analyses relate to the value of goodwill and other than temporary declines in the value of the company s securities 
goodwill is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted on july  sfas no 
eliminated amortization of goodwill and instead requires performance of an annual impairment test at the reporting unit level 
as of both july  and december   the company had goodwill totaling million 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 annual goodwill amortization expense totaled million 
the company identified a single reporting unit for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing 
the impairment test is therefore performed on a consolidated basis and compares the company s market capitalization reporting unit fair value to its outstanding equity reporting unit carrying value 
in accordance with the recommended provisions of sfas no 
 the company utilizes its closing stock price as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of the impairment test in order to compute market capitalization 
the company has designated the last day of its fiscal year as the annual date for impairment testing 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that no potential impairment of goodwill existed since the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
no events have occurred  nor circumstances changed  subsequent to december  that would reduce the fair value of the company s reporting unit below its carrying value 
such events or changes in circumstances would require an immediate impairment test to be performed in accordance with sfas no 
differences in the identification of reporting units and the use of valuation techniques can result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value unless they are held to maturity 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost only if the company has a positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
if not classified as held to maturity  such securities are classified as securities available for sale or as trading securities 
unrealized holding gains or losses on securities available for sale are excluded from net income and reported net of income taxes as other comprehensive income or loss 
the company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of its securities portfolio taking into account the severity  duration and intent with regard to the securities in order to determine if the decline in market value of any security below its amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
if such decline is deemed other than temporary  the carrying amount of the security is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
for the periods ended december  and  there were no other than temporary impairments in the securities portfolio 
loan income recognition 
interest income on loans is recorded using the level yield method 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the contractual loan terms 
accrual of interest is discontinued when its receipt is in doubt  which typically occurs when a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest 
any interest accrued to income in the year when interest accruals are discontinued is reversed 
payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when a loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to satisfy the principal balance and accrued interest 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions 
liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funding for its lending and investment activities include deposits  repayments of loans and mbs  investment security maturities and redemptions  advances from the fhlbny  and borrowing in the form of repos entered into with various financial institutions  including the fhlbny 
the bank also sells selected multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans to fnma  and long term  one to four family residential real estate loans to either fnma or sonyma 
the bank gathers deposits in direct competition with other savings banks  commercial banks and brokerage firms  many among the largest in the nation 
in addition  it must also compete for deposit monies against the stock markets and mutual funds  especially during periods of strong performance in the equity markets 
the bank s deposit flows are affected primarily by the pricing and marketing of its deposit products compared to its competitors  as well as the market performance of depositor investment alternatives such as the us bond or equity markets 
to the extent that the bank is responsive to general increases or declines in interest rates  its deposit flows should not be materially impacted 
a favorable performance by the equity markets  however  could adversely impact the company s deposit flows 
deposits increased million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  the increase in deposits during each of these periods reflected marketing efforts that helped generate additional deposit balances in cds and core deposit accounts 
successful cd promotional campaigns implemented during the year ended december  resulted in cd growth totaling million 
money market accounts realized the greatest growth during the year ended december   increasing million 
during the year ended december   principal re payments received on real estate loans totaled million and on mbs totaled million 
during the year ended december   principal payments received on real estate loans totaled million and on mbs totaled million 
the decreases during resulted from a reduction in customer refinance activities associated with mortgage backed assets 
the majority of this decline resulted from the significant number of loans that were satisfied or refinanced during as a result of historically low interest rates  which substantially reduced the level of loans likely to prepay or refinance during maturities and calls of investment securities totaled million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   providing additional liquidity to the company during these periods 
during the period january through december  the company experienced calls on a large portion of its investment securities as a result of the low level of interest rates that prevailed during that period 
the balance of callable securities during was greatly diminished due to the extensive call activity during during the year ended december   the company received proceeds of million from the sale of mbs and million from the sale of available for sale investment securities 
during the year ended december   the company received proceeds of million from the sale of mbs 
these sales were conducted for various business purposes  including  but not limited to  added liquidity and asset liability management 
the bank implemented a program in december to originate and sell multifamily residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to fnma while retaining servicing 
the bank underwrites these loans using its customary underwriting standards  funds the loans  and sells them to fnma at agreed upon pricing 
typically  the bank seeks to sell loans to fnma with terms to maturity or repricing in excess of seven years from the origination date  since the bank does not desire to hold such loans in its portfolio due to the heightened interest rate risk that they present 
under the terms of the sales program  the bank retains a portion of the associated credit risk 
once established  such amount continues to increase as long as the bank continues to sell loans to fnma under the program 
the bank retains this level of exposure until the portfolio of loans sold to fnma is paid in their entirety or the bank funds claims by fnma for the maximum loss exposure 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  the bank sold million and million of loans to fnma 
during the year ended december   repos increased million compared to a net decline of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   management elected to utilize repos as the primary source of funding for growth in mbs 
during the year ended december   the company added repos with an average maturity of years and a weighted average interest cost of in order to fund securities purchases and or loan originations 
during the year ended december   fhlbny advances declined million  as management utilized repos and deposits as the primary sources for funding asset growth 
during the year ended december   fhlbny advances decreased million  as management elected to prepay and not replace million of fhlbny advances 
the average term to maturity on fhlbny advances that were not replaced during the year ended december  was years 
in march  the company received net proceeds of million from the issuance of debt in the form of trust preferred securities 
these borrowings bear interest at a rate of for years and are callable at any time after years 
during the year ended december   the company utilized a portion of the funds received from this issuance to repurchase its common stock  and invested the remaining balance in medium term securities 
the bank s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources are the origination of real estate loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and other securities 
during the years ended december  and  real estate loan originations totaled billion and billion  respectively 
a continued environment of low long term interest rates during the period january through december contributed to the strong level of real estate loan originations during the years ended december  and purchases of investment securities and mbs  which were million during the year ended december   totaled million for the year ended december  the heightened purchase activity during the year ended december  reflected both the replenishment of the mbs portfolio in response to high levels of amortization during the period and the acquisition of a greater volume of short term securities earmarked for re investment in real estate loans 
during the year ended december   the holding company repurchased  shares of its common stock into treasury 
all shares were recorded at the acquisition cost  which totaled million during the year 
as of december   up to  shares remained available for purchase under authorized share purchase programs 
based upon the closing price of its common stock of per share as of december   the holding company would utilize million in order to purchase all of the remaining authorized shares 
the levels of the bank s short term liquid assets are dependent on its operating  financing and investing activities during any given period 
the bank monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
in the event that the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  an additional source of funds is available through use of its borrowing line at the fhlbny 
at december   the bank had an additional potential borrowing capacity of million available should it purchase the minimum required level of fhlbny common stock ie  th of any new fhlbny borrowings 
the bank is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by the ots  which  as a general matter  are based on the amount and composition of an institution s assets 
at december   the bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements  and was considered well capitalized for all regulatory purposes 
the company s ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was and  respectively  ay december  and contractual obligations the bank has outstanding at any time  a significant number of borrowings in the form of fhlbny advances or repos 
the holding company also has an outstanding million non callable subordinated note payable due to mature in  and million of trust preferred borrowings from third parties due to mature in april  which is callable at any time after april the bank is obligated under leases for certain rental payments due on its branches and equipment 
a summary of borrowings and lease obligations at december  is as follows contractual obligations less than one year one year to three years over three years to five years over five years total at december  dollars in thousands cd s     borrowings including subordinated note payable operating lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements as part of its business of originating loans  the bank has outstanding commitments to extend credit to third parties  which are subject to strict credit control assessments 
since many of these loan commitments expire without being funded in whole or part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
less than one year one year to three years over three years to five years over five years total at december  dollars in thousands credit commitments available lines of credit other loan commitments total credit commitments analysis of net interest income the company s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  is dependent to a significant extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earnings assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits or borrowings 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  the unaudited year ended december   the six months ended december  and the unaudited six months ended december   and reflect the average yield on interest earning assets and average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated

assets totaled billion at december   an increase of million from total assets of billion at december  the growth in assets occurred primarily in mbs available for sale and real estate loans  which increased million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the bank purchased million of mbs available for sale 
these purchases were intended to provide additional yield over other short term investments  while offering liquidity to the bank in future quarters when it may desire to deploy funds into higher yielding investments 
partially offsetting these purchases were principal payments received of million and net sales proceeds of million on mbs available for sale during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the bank experienced a reduction in the historically high levels of principal repayments on mbs available for sale that occurred during this decline reflected a reduction in mortgage refinancing activity during the period as a result of the historically high levels of prepayments during that significantly reduced the total population of mortgage backed assets likely to refinance in future years 
real estate loans including loans held for sale increased million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   real estate loan originations totaled billion  of which million were multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans 
real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of the low interest rate environment during the period january through december offsetting the growth in real estate loans from originations were principal repayments totaling million during the year ended december  principal repayments  which include both regular amortization and prepayments  totaled million during the year ended december  the decline reflected a reduction in overall loan refinancing activity during the period as the record level of loan refinancing during significantly reduced the total population of loans likely to refinance in future years 
investment securities available for sale increased million during the year ended december   due primarily to purchases of million during the period that were partially offset by maturities and sales totaling million 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the year ended december  deposits grew million due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  with virtually all of this growth experienced in cds 
in addition  escrow and other deposits increased million during the period due to increased funding for real estate taxes 
during the year ended december   repos increased million and fhlbny advances decreased million 

see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in march  the company completed an offering of trust preferred securities in an aggregate amount of million 
the trust preferred securities  which bear a fixed interest rate of  mature on april   and are callable without penalty at any time on or after april  these borrowings were undertaken in order to obtain funding for general business activities including  but not limited to  repurchases of common stock and payment of cash dividends 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased million during the year ended december   due to the repurchase of million of treasury stock  a net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss of million  and the payment of cash dividends of million during the period 
these reductions in stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of million  an increase to stockholders equity of million related to the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options and tax benefits associated with both the and stock option plans for outside directors  officers and employees of dime community bancshares  inc stock option plans and the rrp  and an increase to equity of million related to amortization of the employee stock ownership plan of dime community bancshares  inc and certain affiliates esop and rrp stock benefit plans 
both the esop and rrp have investments in the holding company s common stock that are recorded as reductions in stockholders equity contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to their respective equity balances 
this increase to equity offsets the decline in the company s retained earnings related to the periodic esop and rrp expenses that are recorded 
the stockholders equity component of other comprehensive income decreased million during the year ended december  as a result of a decline in the net unrealized gain on investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale that was attributable to increases in short term interest rates during comparison of financial condition at december  and december  assets 
assets totaled billion at december   an increase of million from total assets of billion at december  the growth in assets was experienced primarily in mbs available for sale and real estate loans  which increased million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the bank purchased million of mbs available for sale 
these purchases were intended to provide both additional yield over other short term investments as well as liquidity to the bank in future quarters when it may desire to deploy funds into higher yielding investments 
partially offsetting these purchases were mbs principal repayments of million and sales of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the bank experienced above average levels of principal repayments on mbs available for sale 
these repayments were driven by above average mortgage refinancing activity during the period  which resulted from the continued low level of interest rates during the period january through december in addition to growth in mbs available for sale  real estate loans increased million during the year ended december  the majority of this growth was achieved in mixed use properties that are classified as commercial real estate loans 
during the period  total real estate loan originations totaled billion  of which billion were multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans 
the majority of the bank s multifamily originations were retained in its portfolio 
real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of the low interest rate environment during the period january through december offsetting the growth in real estate loan originations were increases in principal prepayment levels during the year ended december  attributable to the low level of long term interest rates during principal repayments  which include both regular amortization and prepayments  totaled million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  investment securities available for sale declined million during the year ended december   due to maturities and calls of these securities during the period resulting from the continued low interest rate environment 
purchases of investment securities available for sale were immaterial during the year ended december  liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the year ended december  deposits grew million due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  primarily for money market accounts 
during the year ended december   successful promotional campaigns resulted in growth in money markets of million  which was partially offset by a decline of million in cds  as higher rate promotional cds that were maturing were not renewed during the year 
during the year ended december   repos declined million  while fhlbny advances declined million

stockholders equity increased million during the year ended december   due to the addition of net income of million  the increase to equity of million related to the issuance of stock for the exercise of stock options and tax benefits associated with the stock option plans and the rrp  and the increase to equity of million related to the amortization of the esop and rrp 
both the esop and rrp have contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to their respective equity balances 
this increase to equity offsets the decline in the company s retained earnings related to the periodic esop and rrp expenses that are recorded 
all of the aforementioned increases to equity during the year ended december  were substantially offset by treasury stock purchases of million  cash dividends of million paid to shareholders and purchases of stock by the benefit maintenance plan of dime community bancshares  inc bmp and rrp of million during the same period  and a decline in the unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities component of other comprehensive income of million reflecting the general low level of interest rates 
comparison of the operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from net income of million during the year ended december  during this comparative period  net interest income decreased million  non interest income decreased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in a decline in pre tax income of million 
income tax expense decreased million as a result of the reduced pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million during the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to a decline of million in interest income that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest spread decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest margin decreased basis points from to during the same period 
the decrease in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average yield on interest earning assets as a result of the continued repricing of assets during the historically low interest rate environment that has persisted over the past three years 
in addition  prior to january  the overall low interest rate environment resulted in a greater decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities than the decline in average yield on interest earning assets 
during the year ended december   the continued low interest rate environment created the opposite effect  resulting in a greater decline in the average yield on interest earning assets than in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
see section entitled 
interest income below for a further discussion of these declines 
as a result  both the net interest spread and the net interest margin  which had increased during most of and  declined during the year ended december  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average yield on real estate loans and mbs  which collectively comprised the great majority of the company s interest earning assets  declined by basis points and basis points  respectively see the discussion entitled 
interest income below for a further examination of these declines 
partially offsetting the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was a reduction of basis points in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
this resulted primarily from declines in the average cost of borrowings of basis points and a decline in the average cost of cds of basis points  coupled with the movement of the overall composition of funding from higher cost borrowings into deposits with a lower average cost see the discussion entitled 
interest expense below for a further examination of these declines 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from million during the year ended december  interest income on real estate loans  investment securities and other short term investments declined by million   and  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  partially offsetting these declines was an increase of million in interest income on mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december the decline in interest income resulted from the historically low interest rate environment that existed during the period january  through december  that environment stimulated the refinancing and prepayment of higher rate loans in the bank s portfolio  while also resulting in reduced rates on existing portfolio loans that repriced during the period january  to december  although the levels of refinancing and prepayment did experience a slight decline during the year ended december  as a result of an increase in interest rates 
the combination of these two factors resulted in a decline of basis points in the average yield on real estate loans the bank s largest interest earning asset during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  the average yield on mbs declined basis points during the same period as a result of the high level of prepayments on portfolio securities during and as well as the purchase of new securities during the period january  through december  while rates were historically low 
finally  as a result of the low interest rate environment  the average yields on investment securities and other short term investments also declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios  while loan origination demand is strong 
however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments  the bank purchased million of mbs during the year ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of mbs principal repayments of million during the same period  and contributed to an overall increase of million in the average balance of mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result  the dollar amount of interest income on mbs increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   despite the decline in average yield of basis points during the same period 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  due to a decline of basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the company reduced its total borrowings by million by either not replacing borrowings that matured or prepaying outstanding debt 
during the year ended december   the company incurred million of expense on prepaid borrowings  which increased the average cost of borrowed funds by basis points during the period 
during the year ended december   the company added million of repos  and a million trust preferred borrowing 
the repos were added during the period of historically low interest rates  and  therefore  possessed a lower average cost than the existing average cost within the company s total portfolio of borrowings  which was not materially impacted by the increases in short term interest rates that occurred during the period june through december the trust preferred borrowing added basis points to the average cost of borrowings during the year ended december  the combination of activity in these two periods resulted in an overall increase of million in the average balance of borrowings during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   but a decline of basis points in their average cost 
during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense during the period  declined by basis points  while their average balance increased by million 
the combination of these two events resulted in a reduction in interest expense of  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decline in interest rates offered on cds reflected the continued low level of interest rates paid during the period january  through december   which was not materially impacted by the recent increase in short term interest rates that occurred during the period june through december the increase in the average balance of cds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from new promotional cds added during the year ended december  the average cost of savings accounts declined by basis points during the comparative period  resulting in a  reduction in interest expense 
the decline in average cost reflected reductions in interest rates paid by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during  which was not materially impacted by the recent increase in short term interest rates that occurred during the period june through december interest expense on money market accounts increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to an increase in average balance of million during the period 
the increase in average balance reflected successful deposit gathering promotions during the period july  to september  partially offsetting the increase was a decline in the average cost of money market accounts of basis points  reflecting reductions in interest rates paid by the bank as a result of the overall low interest rate environment in effect during  which was not materially impacted by the recent increase in short term interest rates 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was approximately  during both the years ended december  and 
see item business allowance for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decline resulted primarily from decreased prepayment fee income of million  due to a decrease in refinancing driven by the significant levels of refinancing that occurred during  as well as increases in interest rates during the second half of the decline in prepayment fee income was partially offset by an increase of million in the net gain recorded on the sale of loans  investment securities and mbs 
during the year ended december   the net gain on the sale of loans was  during the year ended december   the company recorded a net gain of million on the sale of loans primarily multifamily residential to fnma 
increases in interest rates during reduced the level of gain recorded on loans sold from the bank s portfolio to fnma 
the gain on portfolio loan sales to fnma was significantly higher during  when rates were at historic lows 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a net gain of  on the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million on the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities 
the sale of securities and associated loss during the year ended december  were incurred in connection with a balance sheet restructuring performed in october non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over the year ended december  salaries and benefits decreased  primarily as a result of a reduction of million in benefits accrued under the bmp  which was partially offset by increased salaries resulting from both general salary increases and added staff 
the benefit costs associated with the esop and rrp increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the recording of expense related to dividends paid on unallocated esop shares that commenced in data processing costs increased  during the comparative period  and were primarily due to non recurring charges approximating  associated with a data system conversion completed by the company in november  that affected loan servicing  retail deposit branch operations and accounting transaction processing 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased  due to increased maintenance and utility costs and increased depreciation expense associated with recently acquired furniture and fixtures 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a decline of million in pre tax net income 
the effective tax rate approximated during both the years ended december  and comparison of the operating results for the year ended december  and the unaudited year ended december  general 
net income was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended december  during this comparative period  net interest income increased million  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased million  to million  from million during the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a decline of million in interest expense that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings towards lower cost cds  money market and other deposit accounts  and a decline of basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds basis points excluding prepayment expenses of million and million  respectively  incurred during the years ended december  and 
borrowing costs declined during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to declines in short term and medium term interest rates during and during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and the average rate on real estate loans was typically less susceptible to reductions in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from million during the year ended december  interest income on real estate loans and investment securities declined million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these declines were partially offset by an increase in interest income on mbs of million during the same period 
the decline in interest income on real estate loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease of basis points in average yield during the period that resulted from the reduction in long term interest rates from october to june this decline in interest rates stimulated the refinancing and prepayment of higher rate loans in the bank s portfolio  while also resulting in reduced rates on existing portfolio loans that repriced during the period october  to december  partially offsetting the decline in interest income on real estate loans resulting from reductions in yield was an increase in interest income resulting from the increased average balance of real estate loans of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   real estate loan originations totaled billion  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of declines in long term interest rates experienced during the period which stimulated a wave of mortgage refinancing activities and contributed to higher property values and average loan origination amounts 
the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios while loan origination demand is strong 
however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments in the prevailing interest rate environment  the bank purchased million of mbs during the year ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of mbs principal repayments of million and sales of million during the same period 
this resulted in an overall increase of million in the average balance of mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  however  due to the continuation of low interest rates during the period october  through december   the average yield on mbs declined from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the combination of these factors resulted in a net increase in interest income on mbs of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest income on investment securities declined million as a result of a decline of million in average balance during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and a reduction of basis points in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
the decline in average balance reflects maturity and call activity experienced on these securities as a result of the lower interest rate environment during the period january  through december  the decline in average yield reflects the decline in interest rates during the period january  through december   as higher coupon securities were called from the portfolio 
interest income on other short term investments decreased  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decline reflects the continued low level of short term interest rates during  as well as the decision by the fhlbny not to pay a cash dividend to its shareholders during the quarter ended december   which resulted in a loss of approximately  of interest income by the company 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the continuation of low interest rates during the period january  through december  resulted in reductions in the average yield on mbs of basis points and investment securities of basis points during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the yield on real estate loans declined by basis points during this period 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decline in interest expense resulted primarily from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from declines of million in the average balance of borrowed funds and basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december during the twelve months ended december   the company prepaid million of borrowed funds  primarily higher cost repos  resulting in prepayment fees of million being added to interest expense during the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the company prepaid million of borrowed funds  primarily repos  resulting in prepayment fees of million being added to interest expense during the year ended december  these prepayments of borrowings resulted in the significant reduction in both average balance and average cost of borrowings during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average cost of money market accounts and savings accounts declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during the same period  resulting in a reduction in interest cost of million and million  respectively 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates offered by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during the period january through december substantially offsetting the declines in interest cost of cds  money market accounts and savings accounts that resulted from reduced average costs was increased interest expense associated with increased average balances of million in cds  million in money market accounts and million in savings accounts during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increased average balances reflected successful deposit gathering promotions of the bank during the period january  to december  provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company added  to its loan loss provision related to expected losses on real estate loans  and  to its loan loss provision related to expected losses on consumer loans 
see item business allowance for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   a net loss on the sale of mbs and other short term investments totaled million 
during the year ended december   net gains on sales of equity investment securities totaled million 
during the years ended december  and  the bank recorded net gains of million and million  respectively  on the sale of loans  primarily from the sale of multifamily residential loans to fnma 
service charges and other fees increased million due primarily to increased fees on loans and deposits that resulted from both increased loan origination and attendant servicing as a result of the low interest rate environment and growth in deposit households as a result of ongoing deposit product promotions 
other non interest income increased million due to increased prepayment fee income of million  as a result of prepayments related to the low interest rate environment 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased  during the period due to general salary and staffing increases during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  the increase in the average price of the company s common stock during the year ended december  resulted in increased esop expense of  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  of expense associated with the rrp for which the final vesting of the original grant of  shares concluded during occupancy and equipment expense increased  during the comparative period due primarily to a renovation program on existing branches that was not eligible to be capitalized  as well as from a full year of expenses due to the addition of the glen oaks branch  which commenced operations near the end of the june  and the bay ridge branch  which commenced operations in march data processing costs increased  during the comparative period due to additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to an increase of million in pre tax net income 
comparison of operating results for the six months ended december  and the unaudited six months ended december  general 
net income was million during the six months ended december   an increase of million over net income of million during the six months ended december  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   net interest income increased million  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the six months ended december  increased million to million from million during the six months ended december  this increase was attributable to a decline of million in interest expense that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest income during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the six months ended december  to for the six months ended december   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings and towards lower cost money market and other deposit accounts 
during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   and the average rate on real estate loans was less susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
during the period january through december  the overnight inter bank borrowing rate declined on eleven different occasions  moving from an initial rate of to an ending rate of 
during the period january through october  the overnight inter bank borrowing rate remained constant at 
in november  the overnight inter bank borrowing rate declined to 
because the bank s liabilities generally possess a shorter average term to maturity than its assets  the net interest margin and net interest spread both benefited from the reductions in interest rates during a significant portion of the benefit of liabilities repricing to lower rates was realized during the period january through december  interest income 
interest income was million during the six months ended december   a decrease of million from million during the six months ended december  declines in interest income on mbs of million and on other short term investments of  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  were partially offset by an increase in interest income on real estate loans of million during the same period 
the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios while loan origination demand is strong 
consistent with this policy  total principal repayments on mbs exceeded net purchases of mbs by million during the period october  through june  however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments  the bank purchased million of mbs during the six months ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of principal repayments of million during the same period 
the combination of all activity during the period october through december resulted in an overall decline of million in the average balance of mbs during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  in addition  due to short term interest rate reductions during the period january through december  and the continuation of low short term interest rates during the period january  through december   the average yield on mbs declined from during the six months ended december  to during the six months ended december  the decline of  in interest income on short term investments resulted from a decrease of basis points in average yield on these investments  reflecting gradual reductions in interest rates during the period january through december and in late the decline in yields on these investments more than offset the increase in interest income that would have otherwise resulted from growth in their average balance of million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  growth in average balance during the period reflected increased liquid funds generated during the period january through december from both deposit growth and higher real estate loan and mbs principal repayments 
the increase in interest income on real estate loans was attributable to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans resulting from real estate loan originations during the period january  through december  during the six months ended december  and  real estate loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
loan originations increased during the six months ended december  as a result of declines in long term interest rates experienced during the period which stimulated a wave of mortgage refinancing activities and contributed to higher property values and average loan origination amounts 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the six months ended december  to during the six months ended december  declines in the overnight inter bank borrowing rate brought about by the actions of the fomc during the period january through december  along with the continuation of low interest rates during the period january  through december   contributed to general decreases in interest rates  resulting in reductions in the average yield on mbs of basis points  on investment securities of basis points and on other short term investments of basis points during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the yield on real estate loans declined by only basis points during this period 
real estate loans possess longer terms to maturity or interest rate repricing and  therefore  reacted slower than other interest earning assets to the declines in long term interest rates during the six months ended december  interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the six months ended december   from million during the six months ended december  the decline in interest expense resulted substantially from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from a decline of million in the average balance of borrowed funds during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the average cost of money market accounts and savings accounts also declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during the same period  resulting in a reduction in interest cost of  and million  respectively 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates offered by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during the period january through december provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during both the six months ended december  and 
see item business allowance for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million during the six months ended december   from million during the six months ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased prepayment fee income included in other non interest income of million  as loan prepayments increased during the period due to both declines in interest rates during the period january through december and continued low interest rates during the period january through december in addition  fee income grew  due primarily to additional loan fees of  resulting from increased origination activity  and an increase of  in deposit customer fees resulting from growth in deposit activity 
under the terms of an agreement entered into in december  the bank sold approximately million of recently originated multifamily residential loans to fnma during december  recording a pre tax gain of million on these loan sales 
otherwise  gains and losses on the sale of assets were immaterial during the six months ended december  and non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the six months ended december   an increase of million over the six months ended december  salary and employee benefits increased million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   as a result of increased salaries and staffing during the six months ended december   reflecting growth in personnel added to satisfy needs created by the increased size of the bank  as well as growth in loans and deposit balances  and added deposit products during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the benefit cost associated with the bmp increased million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  due to the accelerated expense accruals of month expenses over a month period 
the accelerated expense accruals resulted from a change in expense accrual methodology resulting from the change in the fiscal year end of both the holding company and bank from june th to december st 
the benefit costs associated with the esop  which are calculated based upon the average market value of the holding company s common stock  additionally increased  due to an increase in the average market value of the holding company s common stock during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  data processing costs increased  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   due to additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
other expenses increased  during the period due primarily to growth in advertising expenses of  as well as an increase in administrative costs totaling approximately  associated with the change in fiscal year end and six month report period ending december  income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   due primarily to an increase of million in pre tax net income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
net income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended june  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   net interest income increased million  the provision for loan losses declined  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
goodwill amortization  which was million during the year ended june   was eliminated during the year ended june  pursuant to the adoption of sfas effective july   partially offsetting an increase of million in non interest expense 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended june  increased million to million from million during the year ended june  this growth was attributable to both an increase of million in interest income and a decline of million in interest expense during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in net interest spread and net interest margin both reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings and towards lower cost money market and other deposit accounts 
during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the twelve months ended june   and the average rate on real estate loans was less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
during the period january through december  the fomc reduced the overnight inter bank borrowing rate on eleven different occasions  moving from a beginning rate of to an ending rate of 
because the bank s liabilities generally possess a shorter average term to maturity than its assets  the net interest margin and net interest spread both benefited from these reductions in interest rates 
the increase in net interest margin additionally reflected growth in the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june   reflecting additional equity generated during the period  a portion of which was invested in interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million from million during the year ended june  increased interest income on real estate loans of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was partially offset by declines in interest income on mbs of million  on investment securities of million and on other short term investments of  during the same period 
as part of its ongoing strategy  the bank continued to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasized its securities portfolio while loan origination demand was strong 
the increase in interest income on real estate loans was attributable to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans resulting from real estate loan originations during the period july  through june  as a result of lower interest rates 
during the years ended june  and  real estate loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase reflected lower interest rates 
the decline of million in interest income on mbs and million on investment securities resulted from declines in both the average interest rate and average balance of these assets 
during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of mbs declined million and investment securities declined million  due to principal repayments  maturities and calls of these securities as a result of lower interest rates that were partially offset by purchase activity 
interest income on other short term investments declined by  due to a decline of basis points in average yield during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   reflecting declines in short term interest rates during the period january through december overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june  declines in the overnight inter bank borrowing rate brought about by actions of the fomc during the period january through december contributed to general decreases in interest rates  resulting in a reduction in the average yield of basis points on mbs  basis points on investment securities and basis points on other short term investments during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the yield on real estate loans declined by only basis points during this period 
real estate loans possess longer terms to maturity or interest rate repricing and  therefore  reacted slower than other interest earning assets to the declines in interest rates during the twelve months ended june  interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the decline in interest expense resulted substantially from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from a decline of million in the average balance of borrowed funds during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average cost of money market accounts also declined basis points during the same period 
the average cost of savings accounts declined basis points during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   resulting in a decline in interest cost of million during the period 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates due to actions of the fomc during the period january through december interest expense on money market accounts increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   despite the decline of basis points in average cost during the period  resulting from an increase of million in the average balance of these deposits during this period 
the growth in the average balance of money market accounts resulted from ongoing marketing promotions related to these accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended june   compared to  during the year ended june  during the quarter ended december   an additional provision of  was recorded related to a loan added to troubled debt restructurings 
the provision of  during the year ended june  reflected the growth in the loan portfolio during the month period ended june  due to net charge offs of  recorded during the year ended june   the allowance for loan losses declined  during the same period 
during the year ended june   overall asset quality required no additional provisions beyond the  allocated to cover loan portfolio growth during the period 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from increased prepayment fee income included in other non interest income of million  as loan prepayments increased during the period due to declines in interest rates 
in addition  fee income increased  during the year due to increased deposit customer fees resulting from both added depositors and changes in fees charged during the period 
during the year ended june   a gain on the sale of securities and other assets of million was recorded  primarily from the sale of equity investments 
during the year ended june   a gain of million on the sale of securities and other assets was recorded which also related primarily to sales of equity investments 
the gains on sales of equity securities during the twelve months ended june  were utilized to offset a portion of expenses associated with the prepayment of fhlbny advances during the year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended june    above the level during the year ended june  salary and employee benefits increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   as a result of growth in management and employees added to satisfy needs created by the following growth in loan portfolio balance  growth in deposit balances  added deposit products  and two new retail branches 
the employee benefit costs associated with the esop  which are calculated based upon the average market value of the holding company s common stock  increased  due to an increase in the average market value of the holding company s common stock during the period  and were offset by the reduction of  in expenses associated with the rrp  as the amortization of the initial stock awards under the rrp was completed on february  goodwill amortization expense declined million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  effective july   goodwill amortization was eliminated in accordance with the adoption of sfas

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s consolidated performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

fsp to provide guidance on accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  to employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans which provide prescription drug benefits 
fsp supersedes fsp sfas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act 
fsp sfas applies only to sponsors of single employer defined benefit postretirement health care plans for which the employer has concluded that prescription drug benefits available under the plan to some or all participants  for some or all future years  are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and thus qualify for the subsidy provided by the act  and the expected subsidy will offset or reduce the employer s share of the cost of the underlying postretirement prescription drug coverage on which the subsidy is based 
fsp provides guidance on measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  and the effects of the act on the apbo 
since the company is currently assessing whether the benefits provided by its postretirement benefit medical plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the act  the measure of the apbo or net periodic postretirement benefit cost disclosed in the consolidated financial statements did not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a depository financial institution  the bank s primary source of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of interest income recorded on  and the market value of  a significant portion of the bank s assets 
fluctuations in interest rates will also ultimately impact the level of interest expense recorded on  and the market value of  a significant portion of the bank s liabilities 
in addition  the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within the new york city metropolitan area  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
neither the holding company nor the bank are subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
in addition  the company owned no trading assets  nor did it engage in any hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or embedded derivative instruments during the years ended december  or that require bifurcation 
in the future  the company may  with appropriate board approval  engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments 
since a majority of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the bank  virtually all of the interest rate risk exposure exists at the bank level 
as a result  all of the significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy is designed to limit the volatility of net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements and has three primary components 
assets 
the bank s largest single asset type is the adjustable rate multifamily residential loan 
multifamily residential loans typically carry shorter average terms to maturity than one to four family residential loans  thus significantly reducing the overall level of interest rate risk 
approximately of multifamily residential loans originated during the twelve months ended december  were adjustable rate  with repricing typically occurring after five or seven years  compared to approximately during the twelve months ended december  in addition  the bank has sought to include in its portfolio various types of adjustable rate one to four family loans and adjustable and floating rate investment securities  which generally have repricing terms of three years or less 
at december   adjustable rate real estate and consumer loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mbs issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
at december   adjustable rate real estate and consumer loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mbs issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
deposit liabilities 
as a traditional community based savings bank  the bank is largely dependent upon its base of competitively priced core deposits to provide stability on the liability side of the balance sheet 
the bank has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of quality service  convenience  and a stable and experienced staff 
core deposits  at december   were billion  or of total deposits 
the balance of cds as of december  was million  or of total deposits  of which million  or  were to mature within one year 
the weighted average maturity of the bank s cds at december  was months compared to months at december  while the bank generally prices its cds in an effort to encourage the extension of the average maturities of deposit liabilities beyond one year  the decline in the average maturity of cds during the year ended december  reflected customers recognition that short term interest rates were at historically low levels and were increasing during the period 
wholesale funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlbny  which provided the bank with a borrowing line of up to million at december  the bank borrows from the fhlbny for various purposes 
at december   the bank had outstanding advances of million with the fhlbny 
the bank has authority to accept brokered deposits as a source of funds 
the bank had no outstanding brokered deposits at either december  or december  interest sensitivity gap the bank regularly monitors its interest rate sensitivity through the calculation of an interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific period 
the interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specified time frame exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
conversely  the interest sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in its net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience a decline in net interest income 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater decline in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus a decrease in its net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience an increase in interest income 
the table presented on the next page sets forth the amounts of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown repricing or maturing during a particular period reflect the earlier of term to repricing or maturity of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
for purposes of presentation in the table  the bank utilized its historical deposit attrition experience deposit decay rate for savings accounts  which it believes to be the most accurate measure 
for now  super now and money market accounts  it utilized the deposit decay rates published by the ots 
all amounts calculated in the table for both loans and mbs reflect principal balances expected to reprice as a result of anticipated principal repayments inclusive of early repayments or as a result of contractual interest rate adjustments 
there are certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table on the next page 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  like annual and lifetime rate caps  which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
at december  months or less more than months to months more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgages and other loans investment securities mortgage backed securities other short term investments fhlbny capital stock total interest earning assets less allowance for loan losses net interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now and super now accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowed funds subordinated notes trust preferred securities interest bearing escrow total interest bearing liabilities checking accounts other non interest bearing liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity positive negative interest sensitivity gap per period positive negative cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative total interest earning assets as a percent of cumulative total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments  and contractual maturities or calls 
based upon historical repayment experience  and  where applicable  balloon payment dates 
the company s consolidated balance sheet is composed primarily of assets that mature or reprice within five years  with a significant portion maturing or repricing within one year 
in addition  the bank s deposit base is composed primarily of savings accounts  money market accounts and cds with maturities of two years or less 
at december   interest bearing liabilities estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled billion  while interest earning assets estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled million  resulting in a negative one year interest sensitivity gap of million  or negative of total assets 
in comparison  at december   the company s consolidated one year interest sensitivity gap was negative million  or negative of total assets 
the increase in the magnitude of the one year negative interest sensitivity gap resulted from a decline in the level of real estate loans and mbs maturing or repricing in one year or less reflecting declines in expected repayment levels of these assets during due to increases in interest rates that occurred during the second half of  coupled with an increase in cds repricing during  reflecting new cds added during that will mature in under interest rate scenarios other than that which existed on december   the interest sensitivity gap for assets and liabilities could differ substantially based upon different assumptions about the manner in which core deposit decay rates and loan prepayments would change 
for example  the interest rate risk management model assumes that in a rising rate scenario  by paying competitive rates on non core deposits  a portion of core deposits will transfer to cds and be retained  although at higher cost 
also  in a rising interest rate environment  loan and mbs prepayment rates would be expected to slow  as borrowers postpone loan refinancings until rates again decline 
interest rate risk exposure npv compliance under guidelines established by ots thrift bulletin a  the bank also measures its interest rate risk through an analysis of the change in its npv under several interest rate scenarios 
npv is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities  plus the value of net expected cash flows from either loan origination commitments or purchases of securities 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could thus result in decreases in the fair value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s consolidated results of operations if they were to be sold  or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  reduce the company s consolidated stockholders equity  if retained 
the changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities 
under gaap  changes in the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  on securities classified as available for sale are reflected in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company s consolidated securities portfolio included million in securities classified as available for sale  which possessed a gross unrealized loss of million 
neither the holding company nor the bank owned any trading assets as of december  or in order to measure the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  npv is calculated under market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter end pre shock scenario  and under various other interest rate scenarios rate shock scenarios representing immediate  permanent  parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates from the actual term structure observed at quarter end 
the changes in npv due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets  liabilities  and commitments to either originate or sell loans and or purchase or sell securities that are included in the npv 
the npv ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the present value of the assets in the same scenario the npv ratio 
an interest rate risk exposure compliance report is presented to the bank s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the report  prepared in accordance with thrift bulletin a  compares the bank s estimated pre shock npv scenario to the estimated npvs calculated under the various rate shock scenarios 
the calculated estimates of the resulting npv ratios are compared to current limits established by management and approved by the board of directors 
the analysis that follows presents the estimated npv in the pre shock scenario and four rate shock scenarios and measures the dollar amount and percentage by which each of the rate shock scenario npvs change from the pre shock scenario npv 
interest rate sensitivity is measured by the changes in the various rate shock scenario npv ratios from the pre shock scenario npv ratio 
at december  net portfolio value at december  dollar amount dollar change percentage change npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio board approved npv limit interest rate scenario basis points basis points pre shock basis points basis points n a n a n a n a n a n a n a the npvs presented above incorporate some asset and liability values derived from the bank s valuation model  such as those for mortgage loans and time deposits  and some asset and liability values that are provided by independent and reputable sources  such as values for the bank s mbs and cmo portfolios  as well as its putable borrowings 
the valuation model makes various estimates regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and passbook deposit decay rates at each level of interest rate change 
the bank s estimates for loan prepayment levels are influenced by the recent history of prepayment activity in its loan portfolio as well as the interest rate composition of the existing portfolio  especially vis vis the current interest rate environment 
in addition  the bank considers the amount of prepayment fee protection inherent in the loan portfolio when estimating future prepayment cash flows 
regarding passbook deposit decay rates  the bank analyzes and tracks the decay rate of its passbook deposits over time and over various interest rate scenarios and then makes estimates of its passbook deposit decay rate for use in the valuation model 
nevertheless  no matter the care and precision with which the estimates are derived  actual cash flows for loans  as well as passbooks  could differ significantly from the bank s estimates resulting in significantly different npv calculations 
the bank also generates a series of spot discount rates that are integral to the valuation of the projected monthly cash flows of its assets and liabilities 
the bank s valuation model employs discount rates that are representative of prevailing market rates of interest  with appropriate adjustments suited to the heterogeneous characteristics of the bank s various asset and liability portfolios 
the npv ratio at december  was in the pre shock scenario  a slight increase from the pre shock scenario npv ratio of at december  the npv ratio was in the basis point rate shock scenario at december   a decline from the npv ratio of in the basis point rate shock scenario at december  at december   the measured sensitivity in the basis point rate shock scenario was basis points  compared to a measured sensitivity of basis points in the basis point rate shock scenario at december   reflecting increased sensitivity year over year 
the increase in the pre shock scenario npv and pre shock scenario npv ratio resulted primarily from several factors  including a significant increase in the intangible value ascribed to the bank s core deposits  a strong increase in the bank s balance of retained earnings  particularly in comparison to the more modest proportionate increase in the bank s total assets  and a greater rate of decline in the value of the bank s liabilities than that of its assets  which is beneficial to the bank s npv 
the bank s core deposits at december  were slightly higher in both balance and weighted average rate than at december  in addition  at december   the bank s balance of borrowings  generally of a short to medium term  increased by over million from its balance at december   while the weighted average rate declined by approximately basis points over the same period 
during  short term market interest rates increased by well over basis points  while medium to longer term rates increased by substantially lesser amounts 
these asymmetrical rate movements  essentially a flattening of the term structure of interest rates  had the effect of markedly reducing the value of the bank s liabilities  which tend to have short to medium term durations  while having a proportionately lesser impact on the value of the bank s assets  which derive a fair amount of their value from longer term cash flows 
in addition  the intangible value given to the bank s core deposits  which benefits the bank s npv calculation  increased by over  even as the balance of deposit liabilities increased by only 
the basis point rate shock scenario npv was lower at december  than at december  this outcome was primarily the result of two factors 
initially  the bank s primary interest earning assets  its portfolio of multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans  increased in duration over the course of as new and refinanced loans were added to the portfolio 
the longer duration resulted in the portfolio showing a greater percentage decline in market value in the december  basis point rate shock scenario npv than in the december  basis point rate shock scenario npv 
in addition  the duration of the bank s portfolio of time deposits and borrowings was shorter at december  than at december  the shorter duration resulted in the portfolio of time deposits and borrowings showing a smaller percentage decline in market value in the december  basis point rate shock scenario npv than in the december  basis point rate shock scenario npv 
finally  the bank s measured sensitivity for the basis point rate shock scenario npv ratio at december  was basis points  compared to basis points at december  the increased sensitivity was a reflection of both the increased duration of the bank s multifamily residential and commercial real estate loan portfolio and the shortened duration of the bank s time deposit and borrowings portfolio at december  compared to december
