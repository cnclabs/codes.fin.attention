a item and a management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk executive summary spcc has been mining copper in southern peru since and currently operates two open pit mines  toquepala and cuajone  high in the andes mountains 
the copper concentrate produced at these mines is further processed into blister copper  at the company s smelter in the port city of ilo 
approximately of the smelter output is then converted into cathodes refined copper at spcc s nearby refinery 
the company also produces copper cathodes using solvent extraction electrowinning sx ew technology 
commencing in  a portion of the cathodes are shipped to a refinery in amarillo  texas and converted into rod 
the remaining blister copper  the copper cathodes and the rods are sold to spcc customers throughout the world 
as part of this process  the company recovers a significant amount of by products  principally molybdenum and silver 
since its inception  southern peru has principally maintained operations in peru 
however  in recent years  the company has refocused its plans and began steps to internationalize itself and broaden its market exposure 
in  the company acquired exploration properties in chile  which are being evaluated for potential exploitation 
beginning in  spcc began tolling copper into rod in amarillo  texas 
the biggest step  in the new focus  however  is the acquisition of minera mexico mm  which is pending completion 
mm is the owner of substantial mining properties in mexico  including the mexicana de cobre unit  which operates an open pit copper mine  a  tpd concentrator  a  ton sx ew facility  a  ton smelter and refinery  a  ton rod plant and a precious metal plant 
the cananea unit  which operates an open pit copper mine  an  tpd concentrator  two sx ew refineries  with a combined capacity of  tons per year 
the industrial minera mexico unit  which holds underground mines  containing zinc  lead  copper  silver and gold  and processing facilities 
the unit also has a coal operation 
with the completion of this acquisition  spcc will become the third largest producer of copper in the world and will roughly double its annual sales and asset base and will substantially increase copper ore reserves 
an overall benchmark used by the company and a common industry metric to measure performance is its operating cash costs per pound of copper produced 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of spcc s cash cost per pound to the cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion as presented in the statement of earnings is also presented 
operating cash cost per pound has been defined by the company as the total production cost  including the cost of purchased copper  freight and sales expenses  administrative expenses  revenues for the sale of by products such as molybdenum and silver  and premiums on copper sales divided by total pounds of copper produced by spcc 
spcc includes in its calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced  revenues from the sale of by products  principal of which are molybdenum and silver 
the company includes these credits because it considers its principal business the production and sale of copper 
the company believes that it is viewed by the a investment community as a copper company  and is valued  in large part  by the investment community s view of the copper market and spcc s ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost 
the recent surge in price of molybdenum  however  has had a significant effect on the company s traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods 
accordingly  the company is presenting cash costs with and without the inclusion of all by products revenues 
spcc excludes from its calculation of operating cash cost depreciation  amortization and depletion  exploration  workers participation provisions and items of a non recurring nature 
depreciation  amortization and depletion are considered non cash expenses 
exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded 
workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre tax earnings and are also excluded 
the company s operating cash cost  as defined  for the three years ended december is as follows in cents per pound cash cost per pound of copper produced cash cost per pound of copper produced without by products revenue a reconciliation of the company s operating cash costs per pound to gaap cost of sale is presented on page spcc s financial results for improved substantially from  which was a marked improvement from the higher copper and molybdenum prices received during the year were the principal reason for this improvement 
in addition  spcc s copper and molybdenum production increased in both and enhancing company results 
the company currently contemplates an anticipated reduction in the volume of copper produced of approximately for this anticipated reduction in volume results from a decline in ore grade at the company s cuajone mine 
the effect of this anticipated reduction in copper volume production in respect of the company s sales is subject to a variety of contingencies  including the price of copper and molybdenum during the year 
years ended december  net sales in millions net income in millions operating cash flow in millions net income per share  basic and diluted pounds of copper sold in millions copper price per pound  lme pounds of molybdenum sold in millions molybdenum price per pound in addition to sales based on the lme copper price  spcc sells copper based on comex  generally to customers in the united states  the average comex prices for the above periods are  and for the years  and  respectively 
the molybdenum price is the dealer oxide price as published in platt s metals week 
production levels achieved at southern peru s mining and processing units were as follows years ended december  ton milled in millions toquepala cuajone copper concentrate produced in thousand tons toquepala cuajone blister copper produced in millions of pounds ilo copper cathode produced in millions of pounds sx ew cathodes produced in millions of pounds molybdenum produced millions of pounds contained in concentrate a new production record 
the ilo smelter project is by far the most significant environmental project ever undertaken by the company and the last major project required to complete spcc s commitment to the peruvian government under the pama 
the project is on schedule to be completed within the deadlines established in the pama 
in most of the necessary civil works required for this project were completed and  or substantially completed 
purchase orders for major equipment needs were placed 
spending on the project during amounted to million and the company has budgeted million for in june  the peruvian congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty tax on the mining industry 
a number of actions have been initiated in the courts to protest this levy and southern peru has filed suit in the civil court of lima to protest the law as unconstitutional 
the mining society of peru  of which spcc is a member  has also filed an action in the peruvian courts to protest this law 
spcc recorded a charge of million in results for this tax  which took effect at the end of june the royalty tax  if upheld  is expected to have a negative impact on the company s future results 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian new sol the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
portions of the company s operating costs are denominated in peruvian new soles 
since the revenues of the company are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the new sol to the dollar  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company could be adversely affected 
the value of the net assets of the company denominated in new soles can be affected by devaluation on the new sol 
the recent inflation and devaluation rates are as follows years ended december peruvian inflation deflation rate new sol dollar change in exchange rate year to year peruvian branch the consolidated financial statements included herein are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the peruvian branch consists of substantially all the assets and liabilities of southern peru associated with its copper operations in the republic of peru 
the branch is registered with the peruvian government as a branch of a foreign mining company 
the results of the branch are consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
expansion and modernization programs smelter modernization the company s largest outstanding capital program is the ilo smelter modernization project 
this project is part of the company s pama program agreed to with the peruvian government in the project when completed will bring the ilo smelter into compliance with peru s environmental requirements 
the contract to supply the technology and basic engineering was awarded to fluor xstrata  the isasmelt technology will be used 
the project is targeted to capture no less than of the sulfur dioxide emissions and be completed by january  as required by the pama 
during  much of the preliminary demolition and foundation work was completed  the construction contractor for the acid plant mobilized his crew  and a contracts for the underground system and seawater intake were awarded with mobilization to begin in early during the fourth quarter orders were placed for the major equipment components 
total budgeted spending for this project is million  including million expended through december  the company has budgeted million spending in for this project 
toquepala leach dump project this project includes the installation of a crushing  conveying and spreading system at the toquepala leach dumps 
the civil work for the crusher building is near completion  the earthworks for the route of the overland conveyor is being finalized to allow for the start of installation  the crusher reached toquepala in february much of the necessary equipment purchases have arrived on site 
the project is now scheduled for completion in july  total budgeted spending for this project is million  and through december  million was expended 
the project is projected to reduce production cost for spcc s leaching facilities by eliminating truck haulage 
pls dams at huanaquera this project is for the construction of new pregnant solution collection dams for the toquepala leaching facility 
the contract for major construction was awarded and civil works are in process for this project 
the budget for this project is million and million was expended through december  new copper filter project this project at the toquepala concentrator  to replace the disc filters with a new vertical press filter will allow the company to reduce operational and maintenance costs  and also comply with environmental requirements 
this new copper filter will process an additional mtpd of concentrate with humidity 
the engineering has been completed  the filter is on site  other equipment needs are on order and construction activities have started 
the project has an approved budget of million  of which million has been expended through december  this project is scheduled to be finished during the second quarter of studies for tailings disposal project feasibility studies for new tailings disposal methods continued in a pilot plant at huacanane creek was installed in lab tests on a new generation of flocculants indicate that major scale testing will be necessary 
through december  expenditures incurred totaled million 
the company expects to have results during the third quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the company has discussed the following critical accounting policies with its audit committee 
southern peru copper corporation s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations  as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires southern peru s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared 
changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate  which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management 
areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include ore reserves  capitalized mine stripping and related estimated mine stripping ratios  the estimated useful lives of fixed assets  asset retirement obligations  litigation and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual a results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ore reserves southern peru periodically reevaluates estimates of its ore reserves  which represent the company s estimate as to the amount of unmined copper remaining in its existing mine locations that can be produced and sold at a profit 
such estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples of drill holes and other openings  combined with assumptions about copper market prices and production costs 
the company uses a copper price of cents per pound to calculate its official ore reserve position 
reserves calculated as mentioned above were declared and filed with the securities and exchange commission in for the cuajone mine and in for toquepala mine 
the company uses these reserves estimates for planning purposes and managing its operations 
these ore reserves are reported to governmental authorities in peru on an annual basis 
the company believes that the cent copper price assumption is consistent with long term projections based on average historical prices over recent full economic and pricing cycles 
commencing in  for purposes of calculating financial statements results  the company recalculates its ore reserves using a copper price based on three year copper price according to comex 
accordingly  for the year the company is using cents  and for and the company used  cents and cents  respectively  for financial statement purposes 
southern peru uses these ore reserves estimates in determining the amount of mine stripping capitalized  units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping and amortization of intangible assets 
at december  the remaining lives of the company mines are years and years  for the toquepala and cuajone mine  respectively 
the reserves estimates have been adjusted for actual production since the most recent reserve declarations 
many companies declare their ore reserves on an annual basis 
the company believes that ore reserves determined by its method closely approximates the ore reserves quantities if they were determined as of december  mine stripping ratios in carrying out its mining operations  the company is required to remove waste materials to access mineral deposits 
because the concentration of mineral deposits is not evenly distributed throughout the mines  there are periods during the life of the mine where the company mines more waste as compared to ore produced  and periods during which the company mines less waste as compared to ore produced 
for each of its existing mines in the production stage  the company s mine engineers have calculated a life of mine stripping ratio which represents the company s estimate of the total amount of waste to be incurred divided by the estimated total proven and probable reserves at each mine 
the mine stripping ratios are used to determine the amount of mine production costs to be charged against earnings 
in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore extracted exceeds the life of mine stripping ratios  the company capitalizes production costs associated with mining operations in proportion to the excess waste mined 
such capitalized costs are included in net capitalized mine stripping  and are amortized to operations using the units of production method 
this charge to operations for the amortization of deferred stripping costs could differ materially between reporting periods to the extent that there were material changes to proven and probable reserves discussed above 
copper contained in piles of leachable materials that have been extracted from the mines are not included in the determination of units of production amortization 
conversely  in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore mined is less than the life of mine stripping ratios  the company reduces the net capitalized mine stripping asset proportionally with a charge to amortization expense 
during periods the company is stripping at the higher rates  increased mining costs associated with the higher tonnages are incurred 
costs of this nature are necessary in a mining operation to insure the availability of mineable ore in future periods 
the company understands that the sec is currently evaluating methods for accounting for a mine stripping costs 
in addition  the company is aware that in recent public comments  the sec has expressed unfavorable views towards the company s method of accounting for mine stripping costs 
however  the company believes that its method of accounting for mine stripping costs  which effectively results in the smoothing of production costs over the lives of its mines  accurately reflects the results and operations of its mining operations and also facilitates improved matching of revenues and related expenses 
during  and the company s stripping ratio was higher than the life of mine stripping ratio for both the toquepala and cuajone mines  which resulted in the capitalization of mine costs associated with the additional waste mined 
if the company were to have expensed all production costs associated with its mining operations as incurred  net operating cost expenses would have increased by million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
estimated life of mine stripping ratios for each of the company s mines for the years ended december   and  were as follows life of mine stripping ratio toquepala cuajone dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 the life of mine stripping ratios for both mines changed at year end  and because of changes in the copper price assumption used and because of changes obtained from mine operation costs to calculate the ore reserves 
at year end  and  the company used a per pound copper price of  and  respectively 
beginning with year end the company began using the three year average comex copper price  in earlier years the company used a per pound price to calculate ore reserves 
in addition  in spcc implemented recommendations from a mine plan study about slope stability  which changed the stripping ratios 
estimated useful lives of assets estimated useful lives of the company s fixed assets are based on periodic evaluation by the company s management and engineers 
changes in such estimates could significantly affect  among other things  the company s operating costs and net income 
during the first quarter of  the company changed the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment to reflect additional information as to historical experience 
this change was accounted for prospectively and resulted in a reduction to depreciation expense of approximately million in asset retirement obligation the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations in this statement requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded 
in order to determine the amount of the liability the company must estimate the cost of fulfilling the retirement obligation 
the company calculates this estimated obligation using available facts  existing technology  current laws and regulations  current costs  and expected costs as determined by company engineers 
this estimation is also based on inflation assumptions using the us cpi consumer price index and using the company s risk free credit rate which is based on the company s credit status 
future changes to any of these estimates or change in assumptions could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
any such increase on future cost could materially impact the amount charged to operations 
litigation and contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal and tax proceedings 
as discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs a for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consulting legal and tax counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
a results of operations for the years ended december   and spcc reported net earnings as follows for the years ended december  net earnings in millions increase decrease from prior year earnings per share the increase in net earnings in is due principally to higher copper and molybdenum prices and to higher sales volume of copper and molybdenum 
copper prices on the lme and comex were about higher in the contribution of molybdenum to net sales increased to million in from million in  largely due to molybdenum prices that were higher in than the prior year and an increase of approximately in production and sale of molybdenum in in addition  increased sales volume and sales price for silver in contributed to the improvement 
despite a day strike in the third quarter of at toquepala and cuajone  spcc was able to maintain ore production and meet its production goals 
the results were reduced by a million deferred tax charge due to a tax rate change and million to record the cumulative effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standard n  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the increase in net earnings in compared with is due principally to the increase in metal prices for copper and molybdenum 
copper prices on the lme and comex were about ten cents higher in and ended the year about cents higher than the year end price 
the volume of copper sold increased by million pounds and the volume of spcc produced copper increased by million pounds 
the contribution of molybdenum to net sales increased to million in from million in  attributable to a increase in price and an increase of almost in volume 
the results were reduced by a million deferred tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect a increase in the peruvian income tax rate for years after us gaap requires that deferred taxes be recorded based on the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which the temporary differences are expected to be settled 
net sales net sales in were  million  compared with million in  an increase in of million 
the increase is mainly due to higher sales prices for copper and molybdenum and increases in production and sale of copper and molybdenum 
in  the company sold million pounds of copper compared with million pounds in spcc mine production was million pounds higher in  both the toquepala and cuajone mines increased production  while the sx ew production decreased 
increased throughput at the toquepala mill and better recoveries and higher ore grades treated at both mills increased copper production by million pounds 
the decrease in sx ew production was million pounds and was caused by low grades 
in  spcc began tolling copper at the amarillo  texas refinery of asarco  incorporated asarco  incorporated is a related party  please see note of the consolidated financial statements  elsewhere in this report thus adding rod to the company s product mix 
copper sales for the past three years included the following products a in millions of pounds sales of spcc mined copper cathodes electrolytic cathodes sx ew blister rod concentrate total sales of purchased copper cathodes electrolytic rod total total all copper net sales in were million  compared with million in  an increase in of million 
the increase is mainly due to higher sales prices and higher sales volume for copper and molybdenum 
copper sales volume in increased by million pounds as spcc production increased because of the toquepala mill expansion completed in the second half of and due to higher ore grades and recoveries at the cuajone mine 
sales of spcc mined copper increased by million pounds  and the company s need for third party concentrates was reduced 
the average copper price increased by approximately cents per pound in  as copper prices increased significantly in the fourth quarter of the year end per pound price of copper on the lme and the comex was and  respectively  at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  molybdenum sales increased in  as the price increased by and sales volume was higher by million pounds 
at december  the company has recorded  provisionally priced sales of million pounds of copper  at an average forward price of per pound 
also the company has recorded provisionally priced sales of million pounds of molybdenum at the year end market price of per pound 
these sales are subject to final pricing based on the average monthly lme or comex copper prices and dealer oxide molybdenum prices in the future month of settlement  which will occur largely in the first quarter of prices sales prices for the company s metals are established principally by reference to prices quoted on the london metal exchange lme  the new york commodity exchange comex or published in platt s metals week for dealer oxide mean prices for molybdenum products 
price volume data average metal prices copper per pound lme copper per pound comex molybdenum per pound silver per ounce comex sales volume in millions copper pounds molybdenum pounds silver ounces the company s molybdenum production is sold in concentrate form 
volume represents pounds of molybdenum contained in concentrates 
a provisional pricing arrangements for certain of the company s sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case of molybdenum products  ranging between one and three months subsequent to the shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment  based on lme or comex forward prices for copper sales  and the platt s proprietary market price estimate for molybdenum 
the provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with our customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
in the case of molybdenum sales  for which there are no published forward prices  the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
these provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as an embedded derivative instrument under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb as amended 
as of december    and the estimated fair values of these embedded derivative instruments  which correspond to the month end provisional pricing adjustments noted above  amounted to million  million and million  respectively  and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheets 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion cost of sales was million in  million in and million in in  the company s cost of sales was million higher than the prior year 
sales of company produced copper increased by million pounds and sales of copper processed from third party material increased by million pounds 
the significant factors causing the cost increase were higher sales volume  including sales of copper from third party material  higher fuel and power costs in  an increase of million for workers participation  a cost based on a percentage of pre tax earnings  which increases as company profits increase  million provision for obsolete material and million provided for the new peruvian royalty tax 
in  the company s cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion was million higher than the prior year 
sales of company produced copper increased by million pounds while sales of copper processed from third party concentrate decreased by million pounds 
the significant factors causing the increase were higher fuel and power costs in including a one time payment of million to enersur sa  the company s power provider  and an increase of million for workers participation 
other operating expenses depreciation  amortization and depletion expense was million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in and was mainly due to capitalization and depreciation of new projects 
exploration expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was principally due to the company s purchase of exploration properties for million from asarco  a company indirectly owned by spcc s majority stockholder 
the company used an independent appraisal firm to determine the value of these properties 
as the properties have not yet reached the development stage  the cost of this acquisition was charged to earnings as an exploration expense 
non operating items interest income was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in and reflects higher amounts of invested cash 
the company invests principally in short term securities 
a other income expense was million in compared with million in and million in other income expense generally includes miscellaneous camp and school income and medical services to third parties  as well as scrap sales 
the amount includes million of legal and consulting fees related to the proposed purchase of grupo mexico mining shares 
the amount includes an million penalty  paid in connection with the prepayment  in  of the balance of the company s secured export note financing 
the company decided to incur the penalty in retiring this debt because the penalty offset the present value of the amount of interest that would have been due over the term of the debt 
further  in retiring the debt  the company was then permitted to avail itself of potentially more attractive long term financing in the future 
total interest cost was million in  compared with million in and million in in  and  the company capitalized million  million and million of interest  respectively  related to expenditures for the expansion program 
the decrease in  and interest expense is due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates 
in february the company prepaid million of its long term debt 
in connection with this prepayment  an unamortized balance of million of deferred loan commissions was expensed in taxes on income taxes on income were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and include million  million and million of peruvian income taxes  million  million and million for us federal and state taxes for  and  respectively 
us income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income as well as limitations on use of foreign tax credits in determining the alternative minimum tax 
the company obtains income tax credits in peru for value added taxes paid in connection with the purchase of capital equipment and other goods and services employed in its operations and records these credits as a prepaid expense 
under current peruvian law  the company is entitled to use the credits against its peruvian income tax liability or to receive a refund 
the carrying value of these peruvian tax credits approximates their net realizable value 
the effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from the effective tax rate is primarily due to the increased utilization of foreign tax credits and the effect in on deferred taxes of the peruvian tax rate change published in the increase in the effective tax rate from the effective tax rate is primarily due to the increase in the carrying value of deferred taxes as the result of the enacted income tax rate increase from to in peru 
the additional tax on leachable ore in and resulted from the difference between the peruvian statutory rate and the rate  which applies to the sx ew operation under a stability agreement with the peruvian government 
in  as both rates are percent  there is no additional tax on leachable ore 
minority interest of investment shares minority interest of investment shares was million in  compared with million in and million in the provision for minority interest of investment shares represents  and for  and  respectively  of the branch s after tax earnings 
the reduction in the percentage of minority interest of investment shares in was the result of purchases of investment shares by the company 
the acquisition of the investment shares has been accounted for as the purchase of a minority interest 
the excess purchase price over the cost of the shares of million  million and million  in  and  respectively  has been allocated to intangible assets on the company s balance sheet 
cash flows operating activities net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared with million in and million in the increase of million in was principally attributable to improved cash earnings  largely generated by higher metal prices and production increases 
a expenditures for capitalized mine stripping decreased in  by million  from the prior year 
during the contribution from operating assets and liabilities increased by million from the prior year 
this increase was principally caused by a build up of million in payables and accrued liabilities  offset somewhat by increases in trade receivables and to a lesser extent by an increased inventory build up 
metal prices were the key factor both for the liability increase as well as the receivable increase 
spcc s earnings generated significant provisions for peruvian income taxes and workers participations 
all of the workers participations accrued in are pending payment  the current portion will be distributed in the first quarter of million of peruvian income taxes accrued in remain to be paid in accounts receivable increased by million in as compared to an increase of million in this increase in receivables was largely caused by higher metal prices 
the price of copper on the lme rose from a pound at december  to a pound at december   the comex copper price  which spcc uses principally in the us market rose from a pound at year end to at year end the dealer oxide price of molybdenum rose from a pound at december  to per pound at december  inventories increased by million in as compared to a decrease of million in metal inventory increased by million in and includes million of copper being tolled at the amarillo  texas refinery of asarco  incorporated 
this tolling business began for spcc in january of in addition  a furnace repair at the ilo refinery in december  created an excess of million of blister copper at the refinery 
this blister copper is scheduled to be processed in the first quarter of the increase of million in was principally attributable to improved cash earnings  largely generated by higher metal prices and production increases 
expenditures for capitalized mine stripping decreased in  by million  from the prior year 
during the contribution from operating assets and liabilities decreased by million from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily a result of the higher metal prices at year end  the lme copper price was per pound at december   compared with per pound at december   which increased the accounts receivable balances at year end the accounts receivable increase reduced cash flow by million in  as compared to an increase of million in the contribution to cash flow from the decrease in inventory was million more in than in addition  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased cash flow by million more than accruals for income taxes and workers participations were much higher in  as spcc s earnings increased 
an increase in prepaid taxes reduced cash flow by million  in the decrease in prepaid taxes added million to cash flow 
cash flows investing activities included in investing cash flow are capital expenditures of million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
in addition  in the company purchased million of marketable securities and redeemed million of these securities 
the major expenditures made in were for the smelter modernization project  for the leach dump project  for mine haul trucks and shovels and for equipment replacement and upgrades 
included in the capital expenditures was million  which was used to complete the toquepala concentrator expansion 
cash flows financing activities financing activities used cash of million and million in and  respectively  and provided cash of million in in  the company paid down million of debt  million of peruvian bonds and million of the mitsui credit 
dividends paid during the year amounted to million and represented of the earnings on which they were paid 
in addition  the company paid million to holders of investment shares and made escrow deposits of million 
a in  the company issued million in bonds in the peruvian market 
proceeds from these bonds were used to help finance the company s capital programs 
dividends paid during the year amounted to million and represented of the earnings on which they were paid 
in addition  the company paid million to holders of investment shares 
the company also purchased investment shares for million 
liquidity and capital resources in january  the company signed a million credit facility with a group of banks lead by citibank  na proceeds of this credit facility are being used to prepay all bonds issued under the peruvian bond program 
in january  the company made a draw down of million to prepay million of the bonds issued in  and additional draw downs of million and million  respectively  will be used to prepay the remaining outstanding bonds 
the new facility has a five year term with an interest rate of libor plus for the first year  increasing by each ensuing year 
amortization of the loan principal begins in the third year 
the company is paying a prepayment penalty of  or million  to the peruvian bondholders 
in  the company was authorized by the comision nacional supervisora de empresas y valores conasev to issue up to million of bonds in the peruvian market 
the goal of this bond facility is to support the company s expansion and modernization program 
in  the company sold to investors in peru bonds for million with maturities ranging from january to may these bonds were sold in two tranches of million each and have interest rates of libor plus and libor plus 
prior to  million of bonds were sold under this program with interest rates of for million and libor plus for the balance 
total issuances under the program totaled million 
proceeds from the sale of these bonds were used to finance a portion of the company s capital spending program 
the libor rate associated with these bonds  at december  and was and  respectively 
the interest rate on these bonds is adjusted on a quarterly basis 
as indicated above  these bonds are being voluntarily prepaid by the company 
in  the company entered a million  year loan agreement with mitsui 
the interest rate for this loan is the japanese libo rate plus japanese libo at december  was 
this facility provided additional committed financing for spcc s modernization and expansion program  and was fully disbursed as of december  the mitsui credit agreement is collateralized by pledges of receivables of  tons of copper per year

the company has not incurred any material non compliance to environmental laws and regulations 
pursuant to peruvian law  in  spcc submitted the environmental compliance and a management program known by its spanish acronym  pama to the peruvian government 
a thorough third party environmental audit was conducted in order to elaborate the pama 
the pama applied to all current operations that did not have an approved environmental impact study at the time 
spcc s pama was approved in january and it contains mitigation measures and projects necessary to bring the existing operations to the environmental standards established by the government  and identify areas impacted by the operations that were no longer active and needed to be reclaimed or remediated 
by the end of  thirty one of such projects were already completed  including all pama commitments related to the company s operations in cuajone and toquepala 
the three pending pama projects all belong to the ilo smelter operations 
the primary areas of environmental concern are smelter reverberatory slag eroded from the slag deposits up until  and atmospheric emissions from the ilo smelter the slag remediation program is progressing as scheduled and is expected to be completed by with respect to the smelter emissions  the third phase of the ilo smelter modernization has started and is scheduled to be completed by in july  the company awarded the contract to provide the technology and basic engineering for the modernization of the ilo smelter to fluor xstrata 
the selected proposal meets with spcc s requirements  which are the use of proven technology the isasmelt from australia and comply with the current environmental regulations 
it is estimated that the construction of the project will be completed before january  the deadline established in the pama 
this represents the biggest outstanding capital investment project for spcc 
the cost of the project was previously estimated to exceed million 
the new estimated cost of this project is million  including million expended through beginning in  and continuing while this project is under construction  spcc has established an emissions curtailment program that has allowed spcc to comply with the annual so air quality standard established by the mem in in the populated areas of the city of ilo  and has been able to reduced violations to the hr air quality standard for the year to four episodes 
two major remediation projects were identified in the pama

on october   the peruvian congress published a new law announcing future closure and remediation obligations for the mining industry 
on march   the peruvian ministry of energy and mines mem published proposed regulations for this law 
the law was amended on may  the amended law  as published  announced a requirement for existing mining operations to present to the mem a mine closure plan  within one year  or before october  since the regulations have not been approved  on october   spcc submitted to mem a notice stating that based on current legislation the company was unable to make a reasonable estimate of its closure obligation 
it is expected that final regulations detailing requirements will be published in  and the company will be required to submit its mine closure plan thereafter 
the law requires companies to provide financial guarantees to insure that remediation programs are completed 
the company anticipates that this law when in force will increase its asset retirement obligations and require future expenditures and amortizations over the life of the mine to satisfy its requirements 
the liability for these asset retirement obligations can not currently be measured  or reasonably estimated  based on the proposed generalities of this law 
the company is studying the impact this law will have on its results  but currently cannot reasonably estimate the effect until final regulations are published
