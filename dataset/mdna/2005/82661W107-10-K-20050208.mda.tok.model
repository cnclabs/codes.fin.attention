item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see the cautionary statement above 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k  particularly under the heading factors affecting our future operating results 
overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops  and markets proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal ics 
we were founded in with an initial focus on providing semiconductor design services on a contract basis 
we began to develop our first ic product  an ac audio codec for pc sound cards  in and began shipping this product in from to  our annual revenues grew rapidly from million to million 
during that time  we began to develop an asymmetric digital subscriber line  or adsl  soc and a portable audio soc 
neither of these products generated revenues  which led to significant operating losses in and during and  the pc audio market transitioned from sound cards to host audio solutions  which are integrated on desktop pc motherboards and in notebook pcs 
as sound cards began to lose market share  we experienced a significant loss in market share and a revenue decline from to in early  we hired our current chief executive officer  ronald edgerton  and established a new management team 
this new management team stopped development of our adsl soc  reduced headcount  and redirected our development efforts towards host audio codecs and portable audio socs 
due primarily to increased sales of our portable audio socs  our revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   and our operating results improved from an operating loss of million for the year ended december  to operating income of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we currently offer products that serve four markets portable compressed audio players  notebook and desktop pc audio  consumer audio  and usb peripherals 
we made our first commercial shipments of pc audio codecs during we made our first commercial shipments of usb peripheral ics in  primarily targeting usb to infrared wireless connectivity applications 
we made our first commercial shipments of portable audio socs in the primary market for these products is the portable compressed audio player market 
during  we also began to sell our audio codecs into the consumer electronics market for products such as dvd players and set top boxes 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our ics 
we principally rely on distributors to market our products 
our sales through distributors result in lower gross margins  but also lower selling expenses than are associated

index to financial statements with direct sales to end customers 
a few customers account for a substantial portion of our sales 
the following table sets forth our customers that represented or more of our revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  gmi technology holystone enterprise creative technology less than creative technology holds more than of our outstanding stock and had a representative on our board of directors until june the percentage of our revenues from customers located outside the us was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
most of the products that use our ics are manufactured outside of the us as a result  we believe that a substantial majority of our revenues will continue to come from customers located outside of the us all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
the percentages of our revenues by country are set forth in the following table year ended december  china hong kong taiwan singapore south korea japan us other total our sales cycles can take up to months to complete and volume production of products that use our ics can take an additional to months to be achieved  if at all 
the lengthy sales cycles of our products make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders 
our sales are made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer electronic products  such as portable compressed audio players  pcs  and dvd players  we expect our business to be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand  and lower revenues in the first and second quarters of each year 
however  our recent rapid revenue growth makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
in particular  strong sales of our portable audio socs resulted in increased revenues during the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  offsetting seasonal demand factors 
sigmatel  inc was incorporated in texas in and changed its state of incorporation to delaware in august by merging into a wholly owned subsidiary 
as a result of the merger  that subsidiary succeeded to all rights and obligations of the texas corporation  and the texas corporation ceased to exist 
prior to the merger  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the delaware subsidiary conducted no operations and had no assets or liabilities other than  of cash contributed to it by the texas corporation 
sigmatel hong kong ltd 
was established and incorporated in hong kong in july and became a wholly owned subsidiary of sigmatel  inc in august of  for the purpose of providing engineering support to our customers in asia for their product development activities 
the following describes certain line items in our statements of operations revenues 
revenues consist primarily of sales of our ics  net of sales discounts or incentives 
we recognize revenues on direct sales at the time of shipment to our customers  or later if dictated by shipping terms 
we defer revenues on sales through distributors with rights of return and price protection until products are resold by such distributors to their customers 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of purchasing silicon wafers  and also includes costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of our ics  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  and occupancy costs 
because we do not have long term  fixed price supply contracts  our wafer costs are subject to the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee  contractor  and related costs  expenses for development testing  evaluation  masking revisions  occupancy costs  and depreciation on research and development equipment 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development activities to develop new products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods in absolute dollars to support the pursuit of new product development opportunities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee  contractor  and related costs  occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  professional services  and promotional and marketing expenses 
we expect selling expenses will fluctuate with changes in revenues  and we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support our future operations as well as the additional costs of operating as a publicly traded company 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
in connection with grants of stock options and the issuance of warrants as a private company in   and  we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation 
these options and warrants are considered compensatory because the fair value of our stock determined for financial reporting purposes was greater than the fair value determined by our board of directors on the date of grant or issuance 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
we are amortizing deferred stock based compensation over the vesting period of the related options and warrants  which is generally four or five years 
this deferred stock based compensation balance will be amortized as follows million during and million during provision for income taxes 
we accrue federal and state income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for certain items including non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits  interest income from tax advantaged investments  as well as changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
in the third quarter of  we released million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to management s belief that it is more likely than not that we will realize our remaining net deferred tax asset 
we expect our future effective tax rate to more closely approximate the statutory rate due to the release of the majority of the deferred tax valuation allowance

revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due to an increase in revenues from our portable audio socs  offset by a decrease in revenues from our audio codecs and usb peripheral ics 
the increase in revenues from our portable audio socs was due to the growth of the emerging portable compressed audio player market and our favorable competitive position within that market 
revenues from our portable audio socs were of total revenues for the year ended december  our favorable competitive position in this market is primarily due to our integration of analog and digital components onto a single ic  and the resulting small form factor  low power consumption  and overall low system cost to our customers 
the decrease in revenues from audio codecs was due to decreased sales to sound card manufacturers 
the decrease in revenues from usb peripheral ics was primarily due to competitive pricing pressures

creative technology purchases our standard products at prices and on terms similar to other customers who buy similar products and volumes 

table of contents 
index to financial statements gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable product mix and a reduction in manufacturing costs  which included both lower wafer costs and lower test costs 
the favorable product mix resulted from increased revenues from our portable audio socs as a percentage of total revenues  as the gross margin from these products is generally higher than from our audio codecs 
included in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million of depreciation related to the abandonment of certain testing equipment 
we expect our gross margins for the first quarter of to be consistent with those achieved during the fourth quarter of however  increased competition could adversely impact our pricing  particularly in the portable compressed audio player market  which could adversely impact our gross margins longer term 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to increases in our engineering headcount  including independent contractors  as well as increases in the costs of design tools 
such increases were primarily to support hardware and software development on our latest portable audio socs  the stmp xx family of products  and our new high definition audio xx family of products 
this increased research and development spending has resulted in substantial completion of the design of these products and the creation of several patentable inventions  enabling us to file additional us patent applications covering inventions made during the stmp xx and xx design process 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenue due to changes in sales volume 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was due to increases in sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  as well as increases in commissions paid to independent sales representatives due to our revenue growth 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million related to the abandonment of a lease of office space 
in december  we abandoned the lease in order to move our austin  tx operations to a larger office space at a lower cost per square foot that would accommodate our rapidly growing staff of engineers as well as support staff 
the total amount incurred in connection with the lease abandonment charge was approximately million  which was expensed in and is reflected in selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect to pay million in and million in from general corporate funds related to this charge 
we do not expect any future charges related to this abandonment 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million of accelerated amortization related to the abandonment of accounting software 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales volumes 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we record deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants which resulted in amortization expense of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amounts recorded during the year ended december  include million of amortization expense related to the vesting of an option that occurred as a result of our initial public offering 
litigation settlements 
in september  a suit was filed against us by crystal semiconductor  inc and cirrus logic  inc 
the parent company of crystal alleging that certain of our products infringed on two of crystal s patents 
we settled the suit in november as part of the settlement  we issued shares of common stock to cirrus valued at million at the date of issuance  which was recorded as a litigation settlement expense

upon the closing of our initial public offering in  we recorded an expense of and paid cirrus million in satisfaction of the contingent guarantee 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in non cash interest charges related to warrants issued to investors for their guarantee of certain of our indebtedness from april through april  as well as  decreased interest expense on lower levels of debt outstanding during the period 
during the first quarter of  we raised million from sales of our preferred stock and used the proceeds to pay down our debt

investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because this can vary in each situation  actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b sab and sab  revenue recognition 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
revenues from product sales to customers other than distributors are recognized upon shipment and reserves are provided for estimated allowances 
we defer recognition of revenues on sales to distributors with rights of return and price protection until our product has been sold by the distributor to their customers 
short term investments 
short term investments consist of corporate  state and municipal securities with readily determinable fair market values and original maturities in excess of three months 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our investments are classified as available for sale and accordingly are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  if material  reported as a component of stockholder s equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in the fair market value of an individual security is determined to be other than temporary 
realized gains and losses on investments are included in interest income 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual costs of our inventory or its current estimated market value 
we record inventory provisions for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
accounting for stock based compensation 
our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to the financial statements 
we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we amortize stock based compensation over the vesting periods of the related options  which are generally either four or five years  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and we have recorded deferred stock based compensation representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price 
we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including trends in the broad market for technology 
table of contents 
index to financial statements stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of our common stock  materially different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
pro forma information regarding net income loss attributable to common stockholders and net income loss per share attributable to common stockholders is required in order to show our net income loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
this information is contained in note to our financial statements 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to our option plan at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows  of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
where it is assumed that the reported amounts will be recovered and settled  and that a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or deductible amount in some future year  a deferred tax asset or liability is established 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies  and to the extent we believe it is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards prior to their expiration 
at september   we released million of the valuation allowance due to our increased profitability and our expectations of future taxable income 
in addition  the valuation allowance was reduced by million to reflect utilization of deferred tax assets that had not been previously recognized 
certain of our carryforwards are subject to limits that may result in the expiration of the carryforwards prior to their utilization 
therefore we have maintained a valuation allowance of million at december  recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts or investment grade securities
