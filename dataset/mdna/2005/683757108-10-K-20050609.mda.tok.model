item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview opnet technologies  inc is a provider of management software for networks and applications 
our solutions address application performance management  network configuration management  capacity planning  and network research and development 
our customers include corporate enterprises  government and defense agencies  network service providers  and network equipment manufacturers 
our solutions are designed to help our customers make better use of resources  reduce operational problems and improve competitiveness 
we operate in one reportable industry segment  the development and sale of computer software programs and related services 
our operations are principally in the united states  and we have subsidiaries in australia  belgium  france  germany and the united kingdom 
we primarily depend upon our direct sales force to generate revenue in the united states 
sales outside the united states are made through our international sales team as well as third party distributors and value added resellers  who generally are responsible for providing technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our revenues are derived from three primary sources new software licenses  software license updates and technical support  and professional services  which include consulting and training services 
new software license revenues represent all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and technical support revenues 
our software master license agreement provides our customers with the right to use our software either perpetually perpetual licenses or during a defined term  generally for to years term licenses 
for fiscal  perpetual licenses represented approximately of software license transactions 
substantially all of our software license arrangements include both perpetual licenses and software license updates and technical support 
software license updates and technical support revenues represent fees associated with the sale of unspecified license updates and technical support under our maintenance agreements 
we offer professional services  under both time and material and fixed price agreements  primarily to facilitate the adoption of our technology 
we consider our consulting services to be an integral part of our business model as they are centered on our software product offerings 
because our consulting services facilitate the adoption of our solutions  we believe that they ultimately generate additional sales of software licenses 
the key strategies of our business plan include increasing sales to existing customers  increasing deal size by selling modules and introducing new products  improving our sales and marketing execution  establishing alliances to extend our market reach and increasing our international presence 
we have focused our sales  marketing  and other efforts on corporate enterprise and united states government opportunities  and to a much lesser extent  service provider and network equipment manufacturer opportunities 
our focus and strategies are designed to increase revenue and profitability 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of revenue growth  we expect to need to closely manage the increases in our total expenses as we implement these strategies 
in march  we entered into a multi year worldwide distribution agreement with cisco systems 
under the terms of the agreement  cisco will distribute a broad range of our software products 
we will also collaborate with cisco s network management technology group to develop new network management solutions 
we expect cisco to begin sales of our products in the second half of calendar summary of our fiscal financial performance during fiscal  we increased revenue  gross profit  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and deferred revenue 
we believe that revenue growth during fiscal was attributable to executing our business plan and to an improving economy 
the following table summarizes information on certain key metrics 
fiscal fiscal amount change percentage change dollars in thousands  except per share data operations data total revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross profit as a percentage of total revenue gross margin total operating expenses income from operations income from operations as a percentage of total revenue operating margin net income diluted net income per common share total employees period end total average employees total consultants period end total quota carrying sales persons period end financial condition and liquidity data cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities period end cash flows from operating activities total deferred revenue period end we achieved growth in all revenue categories during fiscal the growth in total revenue was generated primarily by sales of our products and services to corporate enterprises and the united states government 
in particular  revenue from transactions with the united states government increased to approximately of total revenues for fiscal from of total revenues for fiscal  and contributed approximately million  or of overall revenue growth  in fiscal united states government customers  including the department of defense  utilize our software and professional services to take advantage of our extensive expertise and intellectual property in networking  applications  and protocols 
our ability to model and simulate end to end network and application performance is valuable in determining the impact of tactical or strategic changes to networks  planning for contingencies  and evaluating the impact of new network technologies and protocols 
in addition  our solutions are scalable and address large  complex military systems and networks ie  mobile networks with a variety of operationally proven  advanced predictive performance techniques 
this enables the department of defense to use our software and services to achieve important transformational objectives such as network centricity and improved battle space awareness 
our international revenues increased to million  or of total revenue  for fiscal we expect revenues from sales outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
international revenue in fiscal benefited from a more experienced direct sales force and our increased focus on corporate enterprises 
although sales to corporate enterprises are growing  our international business continues to be dependent upon service providers and network equipment manufacturers for a majority of its revenue 
we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
during fiscal  gross profit increased to million 
although our gross profit increased in absolute dollars in fiscal  it declined as a percentage of total revenue  decreasing from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline as a percentage of total revenue was expected and was attributable to our implementation of strategies designed to expand our consulting business  which yields a lower gross margin than revenues from new software licenses and software license updates and technical support 
as a software company  we believe that our business model has the potential to generate operating margins of or more 
our operating margin decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the decrease in operating margin during fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely the result of expenses associated with sarbanes oxley implementation efforts and investments in personnel necessary to pursue our growth strategies 
during fiscal  we expect expenses associated with sarbanes oxley to significantly decrease  and expect to see benefits from our investments in personnel associated with our growth strategies 
during fiscal as compared to fiscal  we expect to incur increased legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
trends that may affect our business and future results while we are cautiously optimistic that economic conditions will continue to improve and result in a stronger environment for it spending  an economic downturn or adverse change in the regulatory environment or business prospects for our customers may decrease our revenues or lower our growth rate 
the demand for our products and services by corporate enterprise and united states government customers has been much stronger than the demand from service providers and network equipment manufacturers 
we believe that lower business activity with service providers and network equipment manufacturers is primarily due to the challenging economy in which these businesses operate 
we expect the overall challenging economy for service providers and network equipment manufacturers to continue  at least in the near term 
consequently  our revenue growth and financial results depend  in significant part  upon the economic health of corporate enterprises and united states government agencies and the general environment for it spending 
we intend to take advantage of a gradually improving economy and expect to increase spending in all areas of our business in order to promote future growth 
we anticipate the following trends and patterns over the next several quarters total revenue 
despite indications that the overall economy and it industry are improving  we continue to see cautious capital spending by our current and potential customers 
in line with our performance in fiscal  we currently expect any future growth in revenue to come from sales to enterprise it organizations and the united states government 
we expect revenue from sales to service providers and network equipments manufacturers to fluctuate from quarter to quarter with the potential for periods of declining license revenue 
our ability to increase professional service revenues will depend upon our ability to maintain several large consulting contracts with the united states government and to attract and retain additional qualified consultants  including those with security clearances 
as a result of these factors  we believe that we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenues 
international revenue 
our international sales are impacted by the mix of direct and indirect sales channels and our focus on increasing sales to corporate enterprises 
we believe that these factors impact the timing of sales orders as well as our ability to forecast future revenue 
we expect overall international revenue growth in fiscal  however  we expect to continue experiencing quarterly fluctuations of international revenues 
gross profit margin 
we anticipate an increase in the cost of professional services primarily from hiring additional consultants to support demand for our services 
our overall gross profit margin will be affected by the profitability of individual consulting engagements as well as the amount of gross profit from the sale of new software licenses and software license updates and technical support  which have substantially higher gross margins than the gross margin on professional service revenues 
research and development expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development will be required to maintain our competitive position and broaden our product lines  as well as enhance the features and functionality of our current products 
we made significant personnel investments in research and development during fiscal  including personnel associated with the altaworks acquisition in october of we expect the absolute dollar amount of these expenditures will continue to grow but could generally decrease as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses  as a percentage of revenue will depend upon increases in our revenue growth  among other factors 
sales and marketing expenses 
we depend upon our direct sales model to generate revenue and believe that increasing the size of our quota carrying sales team is essential for long term growth 
we plan to add quota carrying sales persons during fiscal to pursue our growth strategies 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to sales and marketing in the future and that sales and marketing expenses may increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to costs associated with our sarbanes oxley implementation efforts 
during fiscal as compared to fiscal  we expect expenses associated with sarbanes oxley to significantly decrease  but expect to incur increased legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
operating margin 
since a significant portion of our software license arrangements close in the latter part of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in the short term to respond to lower than expected revenue  which would adversely impact our operating margin and earnings 
our operating margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due primarily to a significant increase in our general and administrative expenses related to costs associated with our sarbanes oxley implementation efforts and investments in personnel necessary to pursue our growth strategies 
during fiscal as compared to fiscal  we expect to incur increased legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we remain committed to our long term growth strategies and do not believe that adjustments to our cost structure are necessary at this time  but we intend to closely manage expenses 
acquisitions on october   we completed the acquisition of altaworks for a total purchase price of approximately million 
as a result of the merger  we acquired all the assets and liabilities of altaworks 
we paid the purchase price in cash from working capital 
as a result of the acquisition  we acquired two commercially available software products that provide advanced correlation and analysis technologies to our product portfolio for end to end application performance analysis and  with the addition of altaworks employees  have greater engineering depth and technical expertise 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  consequently  operations of the acquired business will be included in our financial statements prospectively from the date of acquisition 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our acquisition of altaworks 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  software development costs and income taxes 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from three primary sources new software licenses  software license updates and technical support  and professional services  which include consulting and training services 
we recognize revenue based on the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
new software license revenues represent all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software  and excludes revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and technical support revenues 
our new software license revenues consist of perpetual and term license sales of software products 
new software license revenues are recognized when these criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the software has occurred  the software license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we define each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for license arrangements with end users  it is our customary practice to have a written contract software license agreement  which is signed by both the end user and us  and a purchase order or equivalent 
a written contract can be executed based on the customer specific format or on the standard shrink wrap software master license agreement 
for those end users who have previously negotiated a software license agreement with us  the initial software license agreement is used as evidence of a written contract 
sales to distributors  resellers  and value added resellers collectively referred to as resellers are currently only made outside of north america and are evidenced by a master reseller agreement governing the relationship  which is signed by both the reseller and us  together with a purchase order on a transaction by transaction basis 
to further evidence an arrangement  our master reseller agreement requires that the reseller provide to us copies of the end user s purchase order and executed copies of the end user s software master license agreements 
delivery has occurred 
physical delivery of our software products to end users or resellers collectively referred to as customers is generally considered to have occurred upon the transfer of media containing our software products to a common carrier usually fob shipping point based on standard agreement terms 
occasionally  software products are delivered electronically to end users 
electronic delivery is deemed to occur after end users have been provided with access codes that allow them to take immediate possession of the software 
if a software arrangement includes undelivered software products or services that are essential to the functionality of delivered software products  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these software products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to any adjustments or refund of any portion of their license fees paid  acceptance provisions  cancellation privileges  or rights of return 
our normal payment terms for our software products and services currently range from net days to net days and primarily vary based on the country in which an agreement is executed 
payments that extend beyond our normal payment terms from the contract date but that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customer s ability to pay 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable  revenues are recognized as cash is collected 
in instances when any of the four criteria are not met  we defer recognition of software license revenues until the criteria are met 
when the sale of the software product requires us to make significant enhancements  customization or modifications to the software that are essential to its functionality  software license revenues and consulting fees are recognized using contract accounting under sop we estimate the percentage of completion  under sop  based on our estimate of total hours to complete the project as a percentage of total hours incurred and the estimated hours to complete 
the process of estimation inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of software license revenues and professional services revenue under certain contracts and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements  including skill level and experience of project managers  staff assigned to engagements and continuity and attrition level of professional services staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if we are required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or if we expect to incur a loss on the project 
software license updates and technical support revenues represent fees associated with the sale of periodic unspecified product updates license updates and technical support under our maintenance agreements 
license updates consist of the right to unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis and are entered into in connection with the initial software license purchase 
license updates and technical support may be renewed upon expiration of the term 
customers can purchase license updates separately from technical support 
revenue from license updates and technical support is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which typically include new software licenses  consulting services  training and maintenance agreements sold together  are allocated to each element in the arrangement primarily using the residual method based upon the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
discounts  if any  are applied to the delivered elements  usually software licenses  under the residual method 
for periodic unspecified product updates and technical support agreements  vsoe is based upon either the renewal rate specified in each contract or the price charged when sold separately 
for consulting services and training  vsoe is based upon the rates charged for these services when sold separately 
for software licenses  vsoe is based on the price charged or to be charged when sold separately 
if the only undelivered elements in an arrangement are periodic unspecified updates or technical support agreements for which we are unable to establish vsoe  all revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
professional services revenues consist of fees from consulting services and training and are recognized as the services are performed 
when we enter into consulting service arrangements that include significant modifications to the software that are essential to the customer s use and the arrangement is bundled with software  revenue under the entire arrangement is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
in these circumstances  revenue to be recognized after applying the residual method is allocated to new software license revenue based upon the relative list price of each product  and to professional service revenues based upon the vsoe of fair value of the professional services  respectively 
we sell new software licenses  license updates and technical support agreements to distributors at predetermined prices 
sales to distributors are not contingent upon resale of the software to the end user 
in most cases  we provide license updates and technical support agreements directly to distributors and the distributors provide support to the end customer 
revenues from sales to distributors are recorded at the amounts charged and in the same manner as all other new software license  license updates and technical support sales 
amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are classified as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for the limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires significant estimates 
in estimating the allowance  we consider the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  should any of these factors change  our estimates will also change  which could affect the amount of our future allowance for doubtful accounts as well as future operating income 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances could be required 
as of march   accounts receivable totaled million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of acquired technology related to our acquisitions of netmaker in march  wdm netdesign in january  a software product for modeling voice communications in december  and altaworks in october they are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of five years except for intangible assets acquired from the altaworks acquisition  which are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
we use the projected discounted cash flow method in valuing our acquired technology  using certain assumptions including revenue growth  cost levels  present value discount rate and working capital requirements 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  actual results will likely differ from those assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
we will periodically review the value of acquired technology for reasonableness 
changes in our assumptions at the time of future periodic reviews could result in impairment losses 
as of march   intangible assets totaled million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for acquisitions exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform an annual review during our fourth quarter or earlier to identify any facts or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
the review is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections and the market capitalization of our common stock 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value 
as of march   we had goodwill of million 
no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
accounting for software development costs 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to our customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the working model stage 
to date  products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time and all research and development costs have been expensed 
consequently  no research and development costs were capitalized in fiscal  and income taxes 
the income tax provision includes income taxes currently payable plus the net change during the year in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the differences between the carrying value under gaap and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues new software licenses software license updates and technical support professional services total revenues cost of revenues new software licenses software license updates and technical support professional services amortization of acquired technology total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for the periods indicated fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of new software license revenues cost of software license updates and technical support cost of professional service revenues revenues new software license revenues 
new software license revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal for fiscal  the increase in license revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes to enterprise and united states government customers of the platform products opnet it guru  opnet sp guru  it sentinel  sp sentinel and dnvm and modules such as flow analysis  netdoctor  and wireless 
it sentinel  sp sentinel and dnvm became available in fiscal for fiscal and fiscal  the increase in license revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes to enterprise and united states government customers of the platform products opnet it guru and opnet sp guru  and modules such as ace  ace decode module  flow analysis  netdoctor  and wireless  opnet vne server which were available throughout all of fiscal and software license updates and technical support revenues 
software license updates and technical support revenues were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal software license updates and product support revenue growth rates are affected by the overall new software license revenue growth rates  as well as the renewal rate of annual maintenance contracts by existing customers 
the increase in software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal and fiscal reflect increases in the overall customer installed base as compared to the prior year 
professional service revenues 
the components of professional services for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal in millions consulting services training and other income professional services revenue professional service revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and of in fiscal from fiscal consulting services revenues comprise   and of professional service revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases in professional service revenues were primarily due to growing demand for our consulting services by united states government agencies 
revenue from consulting services provided to united states government agencies were million  million  and million  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal in january  we were awarded a consulting contract with the united states department of defense that contributed approximately million and million of consulting revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the funding under this contract for calendar year was million 
under the first of four possible contract extensions  the funding under this contract for was million 
in january  we were awarded the contract option for calendar year in the amount of million 
the option years for calendar years and under this contract may be exercised by the united states department of defense at its discretion 
our future results of operations could be adversely affected if any of the remaining options are not exercised or the contract otherwise does not receive additional funding 
international revenues 
our international revenues increased to million  or of total revenue and from million  or of total revenues  for fiscal and  respectively 
our international revenues increased during fiscal from million  or of total revenues  for fiscal our international revenues are primarily generated in europe and japan 
historically  a significant portion of our international business has come from service providers and network equipment manufacturers 
we have focused our efforts on increasing sales to corporate enterprises 
international revenue from corporate enterprises comprised the largest percentage of international revenue for fiscal during fiscal   and  we expanded our operations outside the united states through the hiring of additional direct sales persons in our foreign subsidiaries 
in fiscal and  we also increased the number of distributors that resell our products outside the united states 
we also focused our efforts on increasing sales to corporate enterprises 
international revenue in fiscal benefited from our expansion and increased focus on corporate enterprises 
cost of revenues cost of new software license revenues consists primarily of royalties  media  manuals  and distribution costs 
cost of license updates and technical support revenues consists of royalties  media  distribution costs  and personnel related costs in providing technical support 
cost of professional service revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs in providing consulting and training to our customers 
gross margins on new software license revenues and software license updates and technical support revenues are substantially higher than gross margin on professional service revenues  due to the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing professional services 
cost of new software license revenues 
cost of software license revenues was   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin on software licenses revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in gross margin for fiscal and fiscal were due to increases in revenue and proportionately fewer license sales requiring royalty payments 
cost of software license updates and technical support revenues 
cost of software license updates and technical support revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin on software license updates and technical support revenues were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margins decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to higher royalty payments related to sales of software updates and increases in headcount necessary to support our increasing customer base 
gross margins improved in fiscal from fiscal due to increases in revenue and only slight changes in costs 
cost of professional service revenues 
cost of professional service revenues was million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin on professional service revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in cost of professional services and the resulting lower gross margins for fiscal from fiscal were primarily due to an increase in our consulting staff to meet demand for our services and additional overhead costs required to support growth 
gross margin on professional service revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in cost of professional service revenues and the resulting lower gross margins for fiscal from fiscal were primarily due to an increase in headcount  overhead costs  subcontractor costs  recruiting expenses and certain other costs associated with specific consulting engagements 
we expect the cost of professional services revenues as a percentage of professional services revenue to vary based primarily on the profitability of individual consulting engagements 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of the altaworks acquisition and increased staffing levels required for developing new products as well as sustaining and upgrading existing products 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of the increased staffing levels for developing new products as well as sustaining and upgrading existing products 
the increases in fiscal were partially offset by lower overhead costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of increased staffing levels  and to a lesser extent  increased commission and travel costs associated with growth in revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in average fiscal staffing levels as compared to average fiscal staffing levels  which is associated with executing our sales plan 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher commission costs associated with growth in revenues and increases in travel costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease resulted from a proportionally smaller increase in costs associated with executing our sales plan relative to the higher level of revenues achieved in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased professional services costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased staffing levels necessary to pursue our business plan 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher audit fees  insurance costs  and personnel costs 
the increases in fiscal were partially offset by lower bad debt costs 
other income expense 
other income  net was million   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the increase in interest income is primarily the result of an increase in the aggregate balance of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities together with an increase in interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to the decline in interest rates throughout the period 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the estimated tax deficiency of  related to an irs examination of research and development tax credits claimed on our corporate tax returns for fiscal and see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the irs examination 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and varies from period to period due principally to the amount of income before taxes from various tax jurisdictions and the amount of tax credits available to us in each period from incremental research expenditures 
we expect our effective tax rate in the near term to range from to  however  future provisions for taxes will depend  among other things  on the mix and amount of worldwide income  the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions and the amount of increased research tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and through the sale of equity securities 
in august  we completed our initial public offering in which we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us 
as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from net income  as adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense  tax benefits from exercise of employee stock options  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to lower net income due to increased general and administrative expenses related to professional services costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased staffing levels necessary to pursue our business plan 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to higher net income and deferred revenue due to our revenue growth and increases in accrued liabilities and the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting from our revenue growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
investing activities include the purchase  sale or maturity of marketable securities  acquisition of property and equipment  and net expenditures for business and technology acquisitions 
for fiscal  we purchased million of marketable securities of which million were either sold or matured during the year 
for fiscal  we purchased million of marketable securities of which million were either sold or matured during the year 
for fiscal and  a majority of our capital expenditures were for information technology and software purchases 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities reflects the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  and the issuance of notes payable in fiscal we have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services 
these contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
in accordance with current accounting rules  the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to fund these contractual arrangements with our cash and marketable securities as well as cash generated from operations in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at march   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
in addition  the table summarizes the timing of principal payments on long term debt obligations as reported on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands facilities operating lease obligations long term debt obligations including interest total see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our facilities operating leases and long term debt obligations 
as of march   we have no material capital lease obligations  either individually or in the aggregate 
effective june   we entered into a credit facility with a commercial bank 
the credit facility permits the use of funds for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit up to a maximum of million in the aggregate 
borrowings under the credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
we used the facility to issue an irrevocable letter of credit for approximately million to satisfy the security deposit requirements for our corporate office lease 
upon a default  as defined in the corporate office lease agreement  and written notice from the landlord to us  the landlord had the right to draw upon the letter of credit in whole or in part 
interest is payable monthly  based on libor plus the applicable margin ranging from to as stated in the loan agreement 
the credit facility includes a fee in the amount of per annum on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable 
the loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including a restriction on the payment of dividends and a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a ratio of funded debt to ebitda of as such terms are defined in the loan agreement 
we were in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants as of march  effective june   the credit facility was reduced to million from million and is due to expire on june  as of march   we had no borrowings under the available credit facility 
as of march   we had no available borrowings under the credit facility due to the irrevocable letter of credit for approximately million  which we used to satisfy the security deposit requirements for our corporate office lease 
we plan to renew the credit facility in fiscal year we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and  accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
we expect working capital needs to increase in the foreseeable future in order for us to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that operating activities  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after january  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is effective for us on april  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
management is currently in the process of estimating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
our financial results may as a consequence fall short of the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could affect our operating results include the timing of large orders  changes in the proportion of software arrangements requiring contract accounting  changes in the mix of our sales  including the mix between higher margin software products and lower margin services and maintenance  and the proportion of our license sales requiring us to make royalty payments  the timing and amount of our marketing  sales  and product development expenses  the cost and time required to develop new software products  the introduction  timing  and market acceptance of new products introduced by us or our competitors  changes in network technology or in applications  which could require us to modify our products or develop new products  general economic conditions  which can affect our customers purchasing decisions  the length of our sales cycle  and our customers ability to pay us on time  if at all  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  and the timing and size of potential acquisitions by us 
we expect to make significant expenditures in all areas of our business  particularly sales and marketing operations  in order to promote future growth 
because the expenses associated with these activities are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 
in addition  our revenues in any quarter depend substantially on orders we receive and ship in that quarter 
we typically receive a significant portion of orders in any quarter during the last month of the quarter  and we cannot predict whether those orders will be placed and shipped in that period 
if we have lower revenues than we expect  we probably will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenues or delay of customer orders could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results in that quarter 
for all of these reasons  quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
the market for intelligent network management software is new and evolving  and if this market does not develop as anticipated  our revenues could decline 
we derive all of our revenues from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of networks and applications 
accordingly  if the market for intelligent network management software does not continue to grow  we could face declining revenues  which could ultimately lead to our becoming unprofitable 
the market for intelligent network management software solutions is in an early stage of development 
therefore  we cannot accurately assess the size of the market and may be unable to identify an effective distribution strategy  the competitive environment that will develop  and the appropriate features and prices for products to address the market 
if we are to be successful  our current and potential customers must recognize the value of intelligent network management software solutions  decide to invest in the management of their networks  and  in particular  adopt and continue to use our software solutions 
our customers are primarily in four target groups and our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in one or more of these groups 
our software solutions and services are designed to meet the needs of enterprises  united states government agencies  service providers  and network equipment manufacturers  and we market our solutions and services to those four customer groups 
consequently  our financial results depend  in significant part  upon the economic conditions of enterprises  united states government agencies  service providers  and network equipment manufacturers 
an economic downturn or adverse change in the regulatory environment or business prospects for one or more of these customer groups may decrease our revenues or lower our growth rate 
the united states department of defense may not extend one consulting contract with us  which could harm our business 
in january  we were awarded a consulting contract with the united states department of defense 
the funding under this contract for calendar year was million  and there are four successive option years under the contract that may be exercised by the united states department of defense in its discretion 
in january  the united states department of defense exercised the first of four possible contract extensions 
the funding under this contract for calendar year was million 
in january  united states department of defense exercised the second of four possible contract extensions 
the funding under this contract for calendar year is million 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if any of the remaining options are not exercised  or the contract otherwise does not receive additional funding 
a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 
a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend  in part  on our customers budgets for new or additional information technology systems and services 
a continued economic downturn may cause our customers to reduce or eliminate information technology spending and force us to lower prices of our solutions  which would substantially reduce the number of new software licenses we sell and the average sales price for these licenses 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 
our sales to united states government agencies subject us to special risks that could adversely affect our business 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales directly or indirectly to united states government agencies 
transactions with united states government agencies accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
government sales entail a variety of risks including government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the united states congress to fund the expenditures by the agencies under these contracts 
congress often appropriates funds for government agencies on a yearly basis  even though their contracts may call for performance over a number of years 
a significant decline in government expenditures generally  or a shift in budget priorities away from agencies or programs that we support  could cause a material decline in our government business 
in particular  a decline in government spending on information technology or related services could hurt our government business 
our products and services are included on a general services administration  or gsa schedule 
we believe that the gsa schedule facilitates our sales to united states government agencies 
the loss of the gsa schedule covering our products and services could adversely affect our results of operations 
we must comply with complex federal procurement laws and regulations in connection with government contracts  which may impose added costs on our business 
some of our government business requires that we maintain facility security clearances  and requires some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances 
if we were to lose these clearances  our government business might decline 
the federal government audits and reviews the performance of federal contractors on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations  and standards 
an audit of our work could result in a finding that we overcharged the government  which could result in an adjustment to our previously reported operating results 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with united states federal government agencies 
many of our government contracts are firm fixed price contracts 
to the extent that the assumptions we have used in pricing these contracts prove inaccurate  we could incur and accrue losses on contracts  which would adversely affect our operating results 
a portion of our sales to the united states government are made indirectly as a subcontractor to another government contractor  referred to as the prime contractor  who has the direct relationship with the government 
we also team with prime contractors to bid on competitive government opportunities for which we hope to serve as a subcontractor 
if prime contractors lose existing business on which we serve as a subcontractor  or fail to win the competitive bids on which we team with them  our government business would be hurt 
we could face expense and delay if any or our competitors  or competitors of the prime contractors to which we serve as a subcontractor  protest or challenge contract awards made to us or our prime contractors pursuant to competitive bidding 
federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
these rights and remedies allow government clients  among other things  to terminate existing contracts  with short notice  for convenience without cause  reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts  and claim rights in products  systems  and technology produced by us 
if our newest products  particularly those targeted primarily for enterprises and united states government agencies  do not gain widespread market acceptance  our revenues might not increase and could even decline 
we expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues in the future from sales to enterprises and united states government agencies of version of it guru  which was released in december  and its associated modules including application characterization environment  ace decode module  netdoctor and flow analysis  and vne server  which was released in june our business depends on customer acceptance of these products and our revenues may not increase  or may even decline  if our target customers do not adopt and expand their use of our products 
in addition  sales of our opnet modeler product  which we have been selling since  have fluctuated from quarter to quarter  including periods of declining sales 
sales of our opnet modeler could decline in the future for a variety of reasons  including market saturation and the financial condition of network equipment manufacturers  and if sales of our newer products do not grow at a rate sufficient to offset the shortfall  our revenues would decline 
we may not be able to grow our business if service providers do not buy our products 
an element of our strategy is to increase sales to service providers of sp guru and wdm guru  both launched in fiscal  and vne server  which was launched in fiscal accordingly  if our products fail to perform favorably in the service provider environment  or fail to gain wider adoption by service providers  our business and future operating results could suffer 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict operating results 
it is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenues from sales of our products because prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our products before licensing them 
the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from three months to more than a year 
during the sales process  the customer may decide not to purchase or may reduce proposed orders of our products for various reasons  including changes in budgets and purchasing priorities 
our prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefit of our products 
this may also lead to delays in receiving customers orders 
if we do not successfully expand our sales force  we may be unable to increase our sales 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force  and we must expand the size of our sales force to increase revenues 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills to be productive  or if they reach productivity more slowly than anticipated  our ability to increase our revenues and grow our business could be compromised 
our sales people require a long period of time to become productive  typically three to nine months 
the time required to reach productivity  as well as the challenge of attracting  training  and retaining qualified candidates  may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force  or we may be unable to manage a larger sales force 
our ability to increase our sales will be impaired if we do not expand and manage our indirect distribution channels 
to increase our sales  we must  among other things  further expand and manage our indirect distribution channels  which consist primarily of international distributors and original equipment manufacturers and resellers 
if we are unable to expand and manage our relationships with our distributors  our distributors are unable or unwilling to market and sell our products effectively  or we lose existing distributor relationships  we might not be able to increase our revenues 
our international distributors and original equipment manufacturers and resellers have no obligation to market or purchase our products 
in addition  they could partner with our competitors  bundle or resell competitors products  or internally develop products that compete with our products 
we may not be able to successfully manage our expanding operations  which could impair our ability to operate profitably 
we may be unable to operate our business profitably if we fail to manage our growth 
our growth has sometimes strained  and may in the future continue to strain  our managerial  administrative  operational  and financial resources and controls 
we plan to continue to expand our operations and increase the number of our full time employees 
our ability to manage growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our operating  financial  and management information systems 
our personnel  systems  and controls may not be adequate to support our growth 
in addition  our revenues may not continue to grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger overall employee base 
if we are unable to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that respond effectively to changing technology  our revenues may decline 
our market is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements  frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements  and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that respond to these changes  our products could become obsolete  demand for our products could decline and our revenues could fall 
advances in network management technology  software engineering  and simulation technology  or the emergence of new industry standards  could lead to new competitive products that have better performance  more features  or lower prices than our products and could render our products unmarketable 
our future revenues are substantially dependent upon our existing customers continuing to license additional products  renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 
our existing customers have traditionally generated additional revenues from consulting services  renewed maintenance agreements and purchase of additional software licenses  which represents a majority of our annual revenues 
the maintenance agreements are generally renewable at the option of the customers and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
in addition  customers may decide not to purchase additional products or services 
if our existing customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements or purchase additional products or services  our revenues could decrease 
increases in professional service revenues as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 
we realize lower margins on professional service revenues than we do on other types of revenues 
as a result  if professional service revenues increase as a proportion of total revenues  our gross margins will be lower 
if we fail to retain our key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we might not be able to maintain our current level of revenues 
our future success and our ability to maintain our current level of revenues depend upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales and research and development personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees  in particular marc a 
cohen  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and alain j 
cohen  our president and chief technology officer  could also adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
we do not have employment agreements or any other agreements that obligate any of our officers or key employees to remain with us 
we must also continue to hire highly qualified individuals  particularly software engineers and sales and marketing personnel 
our failure to attract and retain technical personnel for our product development  consulting services  and technical support teams may limit our ability to develop new products or product enhancements 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could impair our ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states 
our international operations subject our business to additional risks  which could cause our sales or profitability to decline 
we plan to increase our international sales activities  but these plans are subject to a number of risks that could cause our sales to decline or could otherwise cause a decline in profitability 
these risks include difficulty in attracting distributors that will market and support our products effectively  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  the need to comply with varying employment policies and regulations that could make it more difficult and expensive to manage our employees if we need to establish more direct sales or support staff outside the united states  potentially adverse tax consequences  the effects of currency fluctuations  and political and economic instability 
we expect to face increased competition  which could cause us to lose sales  resulting in lower profitability 
increasing competition in our market could cause us to lose sales and become unprofitable 
we believe that the market for intelligent network management software is likely to become more competitive as it evolves and the demand for intelligent network management solutions continues to increase 
at least one of our current competitors and many of our potential competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than we do 
in addition  it is possible that other vendors as well as some of our customers or distributors will develop and market solutions that compete with our products in the future 
if our products contain errors and we are unable to correct those errors  our reputation could be harmed and our customers could demand refunds from us or assert claims for damages against us 
our software products could contain significant errors or bugs that may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  the delay in introduction of new products or updates to existing products  diversion of our resources  injury to our reputation  and increased support costs 
bugs may be discovered at any point in a product s life cycle 
we expect that errors in our products will be found in the future  particularly in new product offerings and new releases of our current products 
because our customers use our products to manage networks that are critical to their business operations  any failure of our products could expose us to product liability claims 
in addition  errors in our products could cause our customers networks and systems to fail or compromise their data  which could also result in liability to us 
product liability claims brought against us could divert the attention of management and key personnel  could be expensive to defend  and may result in adverse settlements and judgments 
our software products rely on our intellectual property  and any failure to protect our intellectual property could enable our competitors to market products with similar features that may reduce our revenues and could allow the use of our products by users who have not paid the required license fee 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products similar to our products  which could reduce our revenues 
in addition  we may be unable to prevent the use of our products by persons who have not paid the required license fee  which could reduce our revenues 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon the internally developed technology that is incorporated in our products 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the united states 
others may circumvent the patents  copyrights  and trade secrets we own 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into a combination of confidentiality  non competition and non disclosure agreements with our employees 
these measures afford only limited protection and may be inadequate  especially because our employees are highly sought after and may leave our employ with significant knowledge of our proprietary information 
in addition  any confidentiality  non competition and non disclosure agreements we enter into may be found to be unenforceable  or our copy protection mechanisms embedded in our software products could fail or could be circumvented 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of others  and  as a result  we could become liable for significant damages 
we expect that our software products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionalities of products in different industry segments overlap 
regardless of whether these claims have any merit  they could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert our management s attention and resources  cause us to cease or delay product shipments  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business because we would not be able to sell the affected product without redeveloping it or incurring significant additional expense 
we are currently involved in a lawsuit that alleges our software products infringe three technology patents held by a third party 
based on our review of the technology in the dispute we believe that we have substantial defense to the allegations  and intend to vigorously defend against the litigation 
the case however  is at a preliminary stage  we cannot predict the outcome of the claims  nor can we reasonably estimate a range of possible loss  if any  that may arise 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards could adversely affect our operating results 
the securities and exchange commission  american institute of certified public accountants and various other accounting authoritative bodies continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as with other software vendors  we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we have in the past had to  and in the future may have to  defer recognition for license fees due to several factors  including whether software arrangements include undelivered elements for which we do not have vendor specific evidence of fair value  we must deliver services for significant customization  enhancements and modifications of our software  the transaction involves material acceptance criteria or there are other identified product related issues  the transaction involves contingent payment terms or fees  we are required to accept a fixed fee services contract  or we are required to accept extended payment terms 
because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for software revenue recognition  we must have very precise terms in our software arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle  and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery 
if we undertake acquisitions  they may be expensive and disruptive to our business and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we completed the netmaker  wdm netdesign and altaworks acquisitions in march  january and october  respectively 
we may continue to acquire or make investments in companies  products or technologies if opportunities arise 
any acquisition could be expensive  disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  and adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates  and if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make these acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we make an acquisition  we could have difficulty integrating the acquired technology  employees  or operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we also expect that we would incur substantial expenses if we acquired other businesses or technologies 
we might use cash on hand  incur debt  or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
if we issue additional equity securities  our stockholders could experience dilution and the market price of our stock may decline 
our products are subject to changing computing environments  including operating system software and hardware platforms  which could render our products obsolete 
the evolution of existing computing environments and the introduction of new popular computing environments may require us to redesign our products or develop new products 
computing environments  including operating system software and hardware platforms  are complex and change rapidly 
our products are designed to operate in currently popular computing environments 
due to the long development and testing periods required to adapt our products to new or modified computing environments  our research and development efforts could be distracted and we could experience significant delays in product releases or shipments  which could result in lost revenues and significant additional expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risks and believe that the risk is minimal 
our outstanding note payable has a fixed interest rate and its carrying value approximates fair value 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents  marketable securities or notes payable 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
based on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of march   a hypothetical increase decrease in the interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately  a majority of our revenue transactions outside the united states are denominated in united states dollars 
the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
we currently do not hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
due to the limited nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a change in exchange rates would have a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations
