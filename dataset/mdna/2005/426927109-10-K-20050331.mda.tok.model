item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement in note to the consolidated financial statements 
executive summary this summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the company 
when evaluating financial condition and performance  management looks at certain key metrics and measures 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis including comparisons with peer group financial institutions and with its own performance objectives established in the internal planning process 
the primary activity of the company is commercial banking 
the company s operations are located entirely in the southern and eastern regions of the general san francisco bay area of california 
the largest city in this area is san jose and the company s market includes the headquarters of a number of technology based companies in the region known commonly as silicon valley 
the company s customers are primarily closely held businesses and professionals 
lending loan growth is a key metric used by management to measure market share 
over the previous five years ending december   the company has continued its growth trend in commercial loans 
this growth reflects the company s focus on closely held businesses and success in penetrating this market even in a period of economic stress 
construction lending has declined since  but with evidence of some improvement in market conditions in given the slowdown in construction activity  the company increased its commercial real estate mortgage activity by focusing on financing properties for customers with whom we already had a primary banking relationship 
the majority of the company s commercial real estate mortgages are located in its primary service area and properties financed are often owner occupied 
deposits growth in deposits is another important metric management uses to measure market share 
the company s depositors are primarily located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company will occasionally obtain deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
during  the company began to reduce its reliance on brokered deposits from million on december  to million at december  the company also seeks deposits from title insurance companies and real estate exchange facilitators 
the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to concentrations 
net interest income the management of interest income and interest expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company s total revenue 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net interest income for the company has been significantly impacted by market rates of interest 
although assets have grown from million at december  to billion at december   net interest income for the years ended december  and december  are virtually the same 
this reflects a significant decline in the company s net interest margin 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate 
as the federal open market committee fomc reduced short term interest rates from to  the prime rate dropped sharply from at december  to in june the fomc began to increase short term rates in july and the prime rate at december  was 
the improvement in net interest margin in is attributable to the fomc action in the last two quarters of because of its focus on commercial lending to closely held businesses  the company will continue to have a high percentage of floating rate loans and other assets 
management believes that the company s assets will tend to reprice faster than liabilities when market rates of interest change 
this characteristic makes the company asset sensitive 
asset sensitive balance sheets tend to perform better  ie  generate higher net interest income and have higher net interest margins  in a rising rate environment 
in a falling rate environment an asset sensitive balance sheet does not tend to perform as well 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail in item liquidity and asset liability management 
management of credit risk because of its focus on business banking  loans to single borrowing entities are often larger than would be found in a more consumer oriented bank with many smaller  more homogenous loans 
the average size of its relationships makes the company more susceptible to larger losses 
as a result of this concentration of larger risks  the company has maintained an allowance for loan and lease losses which is substantially higher than would be indicated by its actual historic loss experience 
a complete discussion of the management of credit risk appears in item provision for loan and lease losses and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the significantly lower provision for loan and lease losses in was primarily attributable to commercial loan recoveries of million 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income has become a growing component 
a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income is associated with its sba lending activity  either as gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market or servicing income related to loans sold in the secondary market on which the company retains servicing 
noninterest income associated with sba activity has increased each year from through risks associated with the continuation of this level of noninterest income from sba lending include the possibility that the federal government will eliminate or change sba programs in a manner that becomes less attractive to the company or to sba borrowers 
further  change in the secondary market for sba loans could reduce gains on sale 
higher than expected prepayments of sba loans on which the company has retained servicing could reduce the carrying value of the associated servicing asset and interest only strip 
loan servicing is discussed in item critical accounting policies and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in mid  the company closed its residential mortgage department because of concerns about its long term profitability in changing market conditions 
as a result of the closure  mortgage brokerage fees dropped significantly in and are not expected to be significant in future periods 
the closure of the mortgage brokerage department also eliminated costs  including salary and commissions  related to that activity 
during and  the company recognized million and  respectively  in income related to the short term leasing of electronic test equipment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company significantly reduced the carrying value of the electronic test equipment through a charge to operating expenses 
the company does not expect to recognize any significant income from this activity in the future 
noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company s performance 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company undertook several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve its efficiency 
these initiatives included a reduction in staff and the consolidation of its operations under a common brand  heritage bank of commerce 
prior to the third quarter of  the company had operated with four different bank identities 
the implementation of these changes created one time  non recurring expenses in totaling approximately million which are included in the company s noninterest expenses for the year 
in addition to the nonrecurring expenses the company reduced the carrying value of electronic test equipment which is subject to or available for short term leases 
the reduction in carrying value resulted in a charge of million to operating expenses during key performance measures through its asset and liability management process  the company monitors a number of ratios to analyze the company s performance over time and also to compare the company against similarly sized and situated companies in the banking industry 
management considers the following ratios to be important benchmarks for the company s performance and financial conditions return on average assets net income as a percentage of average assets 
measures the earning power of the balance sheet 
return on average equity net income as a percentage of average shareholders equity 
measures the return on invested capital 
net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
measures the earning power of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
efficiency ratio net interest income plus noninterest income divided by non interest expense 
measures the cost of producing revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
there is no single ratio or metric that summarizes the performance of the company 
the ratios above each take an element of the company s performance and quantify it so that it can be compared over time and benchmarked against other peer companies 
management uses these and other ratios and metrics in assessing and planning the company s performance 
the company believes that the initiatives it undertook in  coupled with increases in short term interest rates including the target federal funds rate and the prime rate  will cause its performance to more closely match the performance of peer banks in the future 
capital management and share repurchases heritage commerce corp and heritage bank of commerce meet the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
as part of its asset and liability process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may chose to pursue 
as a part of this process  the company determined in the second quarter of that its capital levels were higher than necessary 
to adjust capital to levels consistent with its view of current market conditions  the company commenced a stock repurchase plan in june critical accounting policies general hcc s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment spreads could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
the company applies accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations to account for its stock option plan awards 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for probable loan losses the allowance for probable loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between that value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for probable loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses an historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and  as a result formula losses could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate those losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could differ from the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for probable loan losses on page loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and interest only strips is based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made based on management s expectations of future prepayment and discount rates 
in evaluating the servicing assets  management used discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require estimates regarding the amount and times of future cash flows  including assumptions about loan repayment rates  costs to service  as well as interest rate assumptions that contemplate the risks involved 
for the year ended december   management s estimate of constant prepayment rate cpr was and the weighted average discount rate assumption was 
these prepayment and discount rates were based on current market conditions and historical performance of the various pools 
if actual prepayments with respect to sold loans occur more quickly than projected the carrying value of the servicing assets may have to be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the i o strip receivable would also be expected 
stock based compensation under apb no 
 compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount required to be paid to the company by the optionee upon exercising the option 
because the company s stock option plan provides for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of the grant  no compensation cost is required to be recognized for the stock option plan on the date of grant

net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities 
net interest income depends on two factors the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities  and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared with the interest rate paid on those interest bearing assets and liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid

for hbc these lending limits were million and million at december  the company does not have any concentrations by industry or group of industries in its loan portfolio  however  and of its net loans were secured by real property as of december  and while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in the company s market areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans 
over one due in year but one year less than over dollars in thousands or less five years five yea rs total commercial    real estate mortgage    real estate land and construction  consumer  total loans    loans with variable interest rates   loans with fixed interest rates    total loans    in the normal course of business  hbc is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk  in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet 
hbc uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur because a party to a transaction failed to perform according to the terms of the contract 
hbc controls the credit risk of these transactions through credit approvals  limits  and monitoring procedures 
the company established an allowance for credit losses on off balance sheet exposures of  as of december  management does not anticipate any significant losses as a result of these transactions 
commitments to extend credit as of december  were as follows dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
hbc evaluates each client s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by hbc upon extension of credit  is based on management s evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include cash  marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  and or residential properties 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by hbc to guaranty the performance of a client to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to clients 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days and still accruing  troubled debt restructurings and other real estate owned 
management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless they are well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the accrual of interest is discontinued  and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed  and the amortization of the deferred loan fees and costs is discontinued 
any interest or principal payments received on the nonaccrual loans are applied to principal 
loans are charged off when management determines that collection has become unlikely 
restructured loans are those where hbc has granted a concession on the interest paid or original repayment terms due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
other real estate owned oreo consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the related underlying defaulted loans 
the following table shows nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans    loans days past due and still accruing restructured loans total nonperforming loans    other real estate owned total nonperforming assets    nonperforming assets as a percentage of period end loans plus foreclosed assets 
as of december   the company had  in loans on nonaccrual status  which were considered impaired loans 
the impaired loans had a related valuation allowance of  as of december  the company had  in loans past due days or more and still accruing interest and no restructured loans as of december  as of december   the company had  in loans on nonaccrual status  which were considered impaired loans 
the impaired loans had a related valuation allowance of  as of december  the company had  in loans past due days or more and still accruing interest and no restructured loans as of december  as of december   the company had  in loans on nonaccrual status  which were considered impaired loans 
the impaired loans had a related valuation allowance of  as of december  the company had no loans past due days or more and still accruing interest and no restructured loans as of december allowance for probable loan losses the company assigns to all of its loans a risk grade consistent with the system recommended by regulatory agencies 
grades range from pass to loss depending on credit quality  with pass representing loans that involve an acceptable degree of risk 
management conducts a critical evaluation of the loan portfolio monthly 
this evaluation includes periodic loan by loan review for certain loans to evaluate the level of impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools based on an assessment of the following factors past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  size and complexity of the loans  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  bank regulatory examination results  and current economic conditions in the company s marketplace  in particular the state of the technology industry and the real estate market 
this process attempts to assess the risk of loss inherent in the portfolio by segregating loans into four components for purposes of determining an appropriate level of the allowance watch  special mention  substandard and doubtful 
additionally  the company maintains a program for regularly scheduled reviews of certain new and renewed loans by an outside loan review consultant 
any loans identified during an external review process that expose the company to increased risk are appropriately downgraded and an increase in the allowance for loan losses is established for such loans 
further  the company is examined periodically by the fdic  frb  and the department  at which time a further review of loan quality is conducted 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified loans include all loans considered as substandard  doubtful  and loss and may result from problems specific to a borrower s business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower s ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate 
at december   the principal balance of classified loans  which include all loans internally graded as substandard  doubtful  and loss  was  these loans constituted of total loans and of capital and reserves at that date 
as of december   the principal balance of classified loans was  these loans constituted of total loans and of capital and reserves as of that date 
as of december   the principal balance of classified loans was  these loans constituted of total loans and of capital and reserves as of that date 
during the first quarter of  the company identified a  unsecured commercial line of credit with risks identified that create doubt about the full repayment under the original terms of the agreement 
the loan was placed on nonaccrual a specific reserve was established 
subsequent to placement on nonaccrual  the company was advised that the borrower had filed for bankruptcy protection and  was charged off in the first quarter of the company continued to negotiate with the borrower within the framework of the bankruptcy and the remaining  of the loan was paid during the second quarter of an additional  of the  loss was recovered in the fourth quarter of other than this loan and the loans already classified at december   the company has not identified any potential problem loans 
the decrease in the allowance related to the charged offs in it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for probable loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss allowance is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to weaken 
also any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely

the net charge offs in were  compared to  in   in   in  and  in the decrease in net charge offs in was primarily due to a million in the recovery of commercial loans which had been previously charge off 
the increase in net charge offs in was primarily a result of a  write off taken in third quarter of related to a single commercial loan

the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  the formula allowance and the unallocated allowance 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
as of december   and  nonperforming loans had a related specific valuation allowance of   and  respectively 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans 
loss factors are based on management s experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
due to the company s limited historical loss experience  management also considers peer bank loan loss experience to determine the loss factor for each loan category 
the formula allowance on december  was  compared to  on december  the unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
as of december   the company s unallocated allowance was  compared to  on december  in evaluating the appropriateness of the unallocated allowance  management considered the following factors bank s lending policies and procedures changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
economic conditions changes in national and local economic and business conditions  trends  and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the bank s lending management and staff changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff 
changes in trend and volume of past due and classified loans changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications 
quality of the bank s loan review system changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors 
credit concentrations the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
there can be no assurance that the adverse impact of any of these conditions on the bank will not be in excess of the current level of unallocated reserves 
the current business  economic  and real estate markets along with the seasoning of the portfolio and the nature and duration of the current business cycle will affect the amount of unallocated reserve 
in an effort to improve its analysis of risk factors associated with its loan portfolio  the company continues to monitor and to make appropriate changes to its internal loan policies 
these efforts better enable the company to assess risk factors prior to granting new loans and to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that it has adequately provided an allowance for estimated probable losses in the credit portfolio 
significant deterioration in northern california real property values or economic downturns could impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources and require additional provisions to the allowance or cause losses in excess of the allowance

market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values  or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits  borrowings  its trading activities for its own account  and its role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net yield 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  net yields may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or investments or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
the table below sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   using the rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or when it is scheduled to mature within the specified time frame due due in due within three aft er one three to twelve to five due after not rate dollars in thousands months months y ears five years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other institutions

varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
to supplement traditional gap analysis  the company performs simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rate environments 
the process allows the company to explore the complex relationships within the gap over time and various interest rate environments 
for additional information on the company s simulation model and the methodology used to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rates  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
liquidity risk represents the potential for loss as a result of limitations on the company s ability to adjust for future cash flows  to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers  and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the liquidity policy approved by the board requires annual review of the company s liquidity by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior executives  and the finance and investment committee of the board of directors 
the company s internal asset liability committee and the finance and investment committee of the board each meet monthly to monitor the company s investments  liquidity needs and to oversee its asset liability management 
the company evaluates the rates offered on its deposit products on a weekly basis 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
since all of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are located at hbc  all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at that level  as well 
as a result  all interest rate risk management procedures are performed at hbc s level 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company does not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and accept the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk a standard gap analysis  and an interest rate shock simulation model 
the detail from the company s gap analysis is shown under the caption interest rate sensitivity  above  and is not discussed here 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would increase in the event of a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would decrease in the event of a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates market value as a of market value as a of change change present value of assets change change present value of assets dollars in thousands in market in market in market in market change in rates value value mv ratio change bp value value mv ratio change bp bp   bp bp   management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institutions interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the mv methodology does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity risk represents the potential for loss as a result of limitations on our ability to adjust our future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the liquidity policy approved by the board requires annual review of the company s liquidity by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior executives  and the finance and investment committee of the board of directors
