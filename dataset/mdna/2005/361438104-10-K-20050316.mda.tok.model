item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item to this report 
introduction our principal business is providing investment advisory services to mutual funds  institutional and high net worth investors  and investment partnerships  principally in the united states 
through gabelli company  inc  we provide institutional research services to institutional clients and investment partnerships 
we generally manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in a variety of us and international securities through various investment styles 
our revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management  which are directly influenced by the value of the overall equity markets 
assets under management can also increase through acquisitions and by the addition of new accounts 
since various equity products have different fees  changes in our business mix may also affect revenues 
at times  the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices  and this can also impact our revenues 
it is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of assets under management and hence  revenues 
this becomes increasingly likely as the base of assets grows 
for the year period ended december   stocks provided an average total return of about  according to ibbotson associates 
management believes the market will continue to exhibit volatility in line with historical experience 
over the next years  our model for the us stock market envisions average annual returns of to from a combination of nominal gross world product growth  stable profit margins and rising dividend payout ratios  with an offsetting drag on p e multiples from rising interest rates 
we expect that an increase in tax rates or inflation rates would reduce stock market returns 
similarly  increased regulation of the mutual fund industry  combined with growing fee pressures and our willingness to participate in certain ntf programs  may impair our profit margins 
as discussed in the regulation section in item of this report  the sec has proposed and adopted a number of rules under the investment company act and the investment advisers act and is currently studying potential major revisions of other rules 
in addition  several bills were introduced in the prior congress that  if adopted  would have amended the investment company act 
these proposals  if reintroduced and enacted  or if adopted by the sec  could have a substantial impact on the regulation and operation of our registered and unregistered funds 
for example  certain of these proposals would  among other things  limit or eliminate rule b distribution fees  limit or prohibit third party soft dollar arrangements and restrict the management of hedge funds and mutual funds by the same portfolio manager 
changes in laws  regulations  and administrative practices by regulatory authorities  and the associated compliance costs  have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material impact 
overview investment advisory and incentive fees  which are based on the amount and composition of assets under management in our mutual funds  separate accounts and investment partnerships  represent our largest source of revenues 
in addition to the general level and trends of the stock market  growth in revenues depends on good investment performance  which influences the value of existing assets under management as well as contributing to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitating the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels 
growth in assets under management is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels  which is usually based on several factors  including performance and service 
historically  we have depended primarily on direct distribution of our products and services  but since have participated in third party distribution programs  including ntf programs 
a majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through these channels since attempts by some ntf program sponsors to increase their service or distribution fees may result in several of our mutual funds being withdrawn from such programs 
the effects of this on our future financial results cannot be determined at this time  but could be material 
in recent years  we have been engaged to act as a sub advisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations 
a substantial portion of the cash flows into our separate accounts has come through this channel 
these sub advisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship 
the loss of a sub advisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future 
advisory fees from the mutual funds and sub advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly  advisory fees from the separate accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter  and investment partnership fees are computed either monthly or quarterly 
these revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions  financial market conditions and the fee structure for assets under management 
revenues derived from the equity oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios 
revenues from investment partnerships also generally include an incentive allocation or fee of of the economic profit  as defined 
the incentive allocation and fees are recorded as earned with the related compensation expense accrued 
the incentive allocation and fees and related compensation expense may increase or decrease during the year depending upon the performance of the underlying investment partnerships 
we also receive fulcrum fees from certain institutional separate accounts based upon meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment return thresholds over a stipulated period of time 
these fees are finalized and received when the contract measurement period is completed 
fees on the preferred shares in our closed end funds are only earned if the fund s total return is greater than a specified total return 
a total of million of assets in closed end funds are subject to such arrangements 
commission revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of mutual funds  institutional and high net worth clients as well as investment banking revenue  which consists of underwriting profits  selling concessions and management fees associated with underwriting activities 
commission revenues vary directly with account trading activity and new account generation 
investment banking revenues are directly impacted by the overall market conditions  which affect the number of public offerings which may take place 
distribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fee revenue in accordance with rule b b of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues 
distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of assets under management and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by gabelli company and through various distribution channels 
as discussed in the regulation section in item of this report  several bills were introduced in the prior congress that  if adopted  would  among other things  pose a risk to gabelli company s future distribution fee revenue as b fees may be limited or eliminated 
compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers  portfolio managers  sales  trading  research and all other professional staff 
other operating expenses include marketing  product distribution and promotion costs  clearing charges and fees for gabelli company s brokerage operation  and other general and administrative operating costs 
other income and expenses include net gain from investments which includes both realized and unrealized gains  interest and dividend income  and interest expense 
net gains from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments 
minority interest represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders  as reported on a separate company basis  of our consolidated majority owned subsidiaries

assets under management ended the year at a record billion  a increase over prior year end assets under management of billion 
the effect of a full twelve months of the gabelli dividend and income trust gdv as well as an increase in average assets under management of billion to billion in from billion in the initial public offering of gdv generated gross proceeds of approximately billion in november and added an additional million of gross proceeds through the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in january mutual fund revenues increased million or  as higher revenues from open end equity mutual funds and closed end funds were offset slightly by lower revenues from fixed income mutual funds 
revenue from open end equity funds increased million or from the prior year as average assets under management in increased to billion from billion in closed end fund revenues increased million or from the prior year principally due to fees earned from gdv 
revenue from separate accounts increased million or principally due to higher average asset levels and an increase in fulcrum fees earned on certain accounts traceable to excellent performance relative to benchmark 
assets in our equity separate accounts rose million or for the year despite a sub advisory client transferring management of the largest of its three portfolios approximately million to another asset manager in mid november 
the loss of this sub advisory portfolio will have a negative impact on revenues in total advisory fees from investment partnerships decreased to million in from million in higher overall assets under management led to an increase in management fees of to million from million in incentive allocations and fees from investment partnerships  which generally represent of the economic profit  decreased to million in compared to million in commissions commission revenues in were million  million or higher than commission revenues of million in the increase in revenues was due to an increase agency trading activity for accounts managed by affiliated companies and higher revenues from institutional customers 
commission revenues derived from transactions on behalf of our mutual funds and separate account clients totaled million  or approximately of total commission revenues in distribution fees and other income distribution fees and other income increased or million to million in from million in the year to year increase was principally the result of higher average assets under management in our open end equity mutual funds with distribution plans

compensation compensation costs  which are largely variable in nature and increase or decrease as revenues grow or decline  increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in our variable compensation costs increased million to million in from million in but declined  as a percent of revenues  to in compared to in the increase in total variable compensation costs is principally due to higher revenues from separate accounts and mutual funds an increase of million partially offset by lower variable compensation costs related to investment partnerships a decrease of million 
the decrease  as a percent of revenues  is traceable to a shift in revenue mix from investment partnerships to separate accounts and mutual funds 
fixed compensation costs rose approximately million to million in from million in principally due to increases in salaries  accruals for incentive compensation and stock option expense 
management fee management fee expense  for acting as ceo  is incentive based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of of the aggregate pre tax profits which is paid to mr 
gabelli pursuant to his employment agreement so long as he is an executive of gabelli and devoting the substantial majority of his working time to the business 
in  management fee expense increased to million in versus million in other operating expenses other operating expenses  which include marketing  promotion and distribution costs as well as general operating expenses increased million or to million in a large portion of this increase related to ongoing distribution costs for the two new closed end funds  gdv and glu million as well as higher general operating expenses including accounting  legal and insurance costs which include compliance costs with the sarbanes oxley act of as well as other regulatory and governance initiatives 
these costs are expected to continue to have an impact in as well as in subsequent years 
other income and expense our proprietary investment portfolio consists of investments in mutual funds  us treasury bills  common stocks as well as other investments including limited partnerships and offshore funds 
net gain from investments  which is derived from our proprietary investment portfolio  was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million in in and gains of  and  respectively  were realized from the repurchase of  shares and  shares  respectively  of our mandatory convertible securities 
interest and dividend income was million in compared to million in the increase in dividend income was principally the result of our investments in gdv and westwood holdings group  inc whg as dividend income for these investments increased million and million  respectively 
interest income rose principally due to an increase in short term interest rates 
interest expense rose million to million in  from million in the increase was due an entire year of interest expense on our million of senior notes  which were issued in may  offset partially by the full year effect of a one percentage point decrease in the interest rate on our convertible note from to which occurred in august and the decrease of the interest rate on the senior notes issued in connection with our mandatory convertible securities to from due to the remarketing in november the convertible note is convertible  at the holder s option  into shares of our class a common stock at per share 
the mandatory convertible securities consist of both a purchase contract to purchase shares of our class a common stock on february  and senior notes due february  the purchase contract includes a contract adjustment payment of per year through february  and the notes bear interest at per year  which rate was reset on november  to income taxes the effective tax rate for was down from the effective tax rate of as we adjusted the tax rate in to reflect our estimate of the current year end tax liability

the full number of shares which may be issued upon conversion of this note is approximately million 
shares issuable under the mandatory convertible securities are excluded from the diluted shares calculation under current accounting rules but will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share upon settlement of the purchase contracts on february  during  we issued  shares from the exercise of stock options and  shares from the early settlement of purchase contracts relating to the mandatory convertible securities 
the settlement of the remaining purchase contracts in february resulted in the issuance of  shares of our class a common stock and the receipt of million in proceeds 
this will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share in at december   we had  options outstanding to purchase our class a common stock which were granted under our stock award and incentive plans the plans

we believe the following critical assumptions and estimates are those applied to revenue recognition  the valuation of investments  goodwill and other long lived intangibles  income taxes  stock based compensation accounting and the possible impact of financial interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
revenue recognition advisory fees from the mutual funds and sub advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly  advisory fees from the separate accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the beginning of a quarter  and investment partnership fees are computed either monthly or quarterly 
revenues from our investment partnerships also generally include an incentive allocation or fee of of the economic profit  as defined  which is recorded as earned 
the incentive allocation and fees may increase or decrease during the year as the profits of the product increase or decrease 
revenues may also include performance fees and fulcrum fees from certain separate accounts and closed end funds based upon meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment return thresholds over a stipulated period of time 
performance and fulcrum fees are finalized and received when the contract period is completed 
investments we hold investments in limited partnerships and offshore funds including affiliates  whose underlying assets consist mainly of marketable securities  which are accounted for using the equity method  under which we record our share of the earnings or losses into income as earned 
while most of the underlying investments of these entities are publicly traded and have readily available market valuations  some of their investments are non publicly traded whose value may be difficult to determine 
investments are written down when management believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and thereby require an impairment charge to earnings 
goodwill and other long lived intangible assets prior to the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other long lived intangible assets were amortized each year 
the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of eliminated the amortization of these assets and established requirements for having them tested for impairment at least annually 
at november  management assessed the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  it may result in an impairment charge for these assets to income 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we prepare a number of tax returns  which are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the inherent complications in the various tax codes often create the need for subjective judgments in applying its provisions 
while management believes that tax positions taken comply with tax law and are both reasonable and supported by the facts and circumstances of the situation  upon audit additional taxes may be assessed 
while assessments may be proposed in the future  both the extent of and potential impact on financial results cannot be determined at this time 
stock based compensation effective january   we use a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation provided to our employees in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the estimated fair value of option awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
this sophisticated model utilizes a number of assumptions in arriving at its results  including the estimated life of the option  the risk free interest rate at the date of grant and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
there may be other factors  which have not been considered  which may have an effect on the value of the options as well 
the effects of changing any of the assumptions or factors employed by the black scholes model may result in a significantly different valuation for the options and a resulting difference in our net income 
recent accounting developments in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 which rescinded sfas no 
reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
under sfas no 
 all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result of the rescission  the criteria in apb opinion no 
is used to classify gains and losses from debt extinguishments 
since the issuance of sfas no 
 the use of debt extinguishments has become a part of the risk management strategy of many companies  particularly those who participate in the secondary lending markets 
debt extinguishment no longer meets the criteria for classification as extraordinary items in apb opinion no 
accordingly  gains from the repurchase of our mandatory convertible securities in  and of   and  respectively  have been included in net gain from investments and not as an extraordinary item 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in  and and is not expected to have a material impact on future consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin  which provides accounting  and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we indemnify our clearing brokers for losses they may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by our broker dealer subsidiaries 
in accordance with new york stock exchange rules customer balances are typically collateralized by customer securities or supported by other recourse provisions 
in addition  we further limit margin balances to a maximum of versus permitted under exchange regulations 
at december  the total amount of customer balances subject to indemnification ie margin debits was immaterial 
the company also has entered into arrangements with various other third parties which provide for indemnification against losses  costs  claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their obligations under our agreement  except for gross negligence or bad faith 
the company has had no claims or payments pursuant to these or prior agreements  and we believe the likelihood of a claim being made is remote 
utilizing the methodology in fin  our estimate of the value of such agreements is de minimis  and therefore an accrual has not been made in the financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  we expect to adopt statement r on january  in light of our prospective adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of statement r for all grants of employee stock options subsequent to january   the adoption of statement r is not expected to have a material impact on future consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin addresses the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to variable interest entities vie and generally would require that the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it 
the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity ie  variable interests 
an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights  absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
once an entity is determined to be a vie  its assets  liabilities and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity which either will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns 
the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss  fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
on december   the fasb issued a revision to fin to clarify some of the provisions of this interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
application by public entities  other than small business issuers  for all other types of variable interest entities was required in financial statements for periods ending after march  while gbl is generally not subject to a majority of the risks of the vies  it may be determined  for certain entities  that we receive a majority of the expected residual returns based on the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary 
therefore  when implemented  the interpretation may require consolidation of certain of our investment in partnerships and affiliates assets and liabilities and results of operations with minority interest recorded for the ownership share applicable to other investors 
the difference between consolidation and the equity method will impact detailed line items reported within the consolidated financial statements but not overall consolidated net income or stockholders equity 
where consolidation is not required additional disclosures may be required 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  under sfas no 
certain financial instruments shall be classified as a liability on the issuer s financials statements 
the company has adopted this statement  which did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
seasonality and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs  as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing our assets under management  revenues or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk reference is made to the information contained under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk
