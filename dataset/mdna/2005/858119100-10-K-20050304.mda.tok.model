forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statements that may project  indicate or imply future results  events  performance or achievements 
we refer you  however  to the sections denominated forward looking statements and risk factors in this report for a more detailed discussion of some of the many factors  variables  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may have expected or anticipated 
we caution that any forward looking statement reflects only our reasonable belief at the time the statement is made 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and respective notes appearing elsewhere in this filing 
business discussion we are a domestic steel manufacturing company that primarily owns and operates electric arc furnace mini mills 
our steel operations include a flat roll division  a structural and rail division and a bar products division 
our steel divisions operate technologically advanced mini mills  producing steel from steel scrap  using electric arc melting furnaces  continuous casting and automated rolling mills 
the flat roll division sells a broad range of hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of specialty products such as thinner gauge hot rolled products  galvanized products  and painted products 
the structural and rail division sells structural steel beams  pilings  and other steel components 
this facility is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premium grade rail for the railroad industry 
during the fourth quarter of  the division shipped its first industrial quality rail  and anticipates shipping standard rail during the first half of the bar products division currently sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and round cornered squares 
the divisions sell directly to end users and service centers 
these products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 

back to contents the flat roll division s revenues as a percentage of total consolidated net sales declined throughout the last three years as a result of our growth  as shown on the charts below 
our structural and rail division commenced operations in the third quarter of and our bar products division began operations on december  the following graphs depict our product mix of consolidated shipments by division during the past three years 
pie charts 
jpg 
our product mix has become more diversified during the last three years and we expect it to continue to move toward higher value added products during  with the addition of standard and premium rail and the continued production increases at our bar products division 
the following table depicts our product mix of total shipments by major product group during the past three years flat roll hot band pickled oiled cold rolled cold rolled galvanized hot rolled galvanized post anneal painted structural wide flange beams h piling bar special bar quality bars special bar quality billets merchant bar quality bars fabrication joist deck metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant manufacturing cost and historically  has generally accounted for between and of our consolidated cost of goods sold 
however  due to increasing metallic raw material costs  this percentage climbed to during the metallic raw material mix utilized in our electric arc furnaces is generally composed of approximately steel scrap and alternative iron units 
from the second quarter of throughout  we experienced a steady decline in metallic raw material pricing  reaching historically low levels in the fourth quarter of  however  during and through current markets  we have experienced a steady pricing increase 
metallic raw material costs are now at historical highs 
we believe the volatility of the metallic market necessitates the generation of a 
back to contents cost effective alternative iron source 
we believe iron dynamics and our investment in the mesabi nugget joint venture are important inroads in helping control our costs related to pig iron and steel scrap 
iron dynamics  our wholly owned subsidiary  involves the pioneering of a process to produce direct reduced iron  to compact that material to form hot briquetted iron hbi  and to then convert the hbi into liquid pig iron 
hbi and liquid pig iron are high quality steel scrap substitutes that can be used in our electric arc furnaces 
during  idi commenced initial start up and produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to the company s flat roll division 
however  it was determined that idi would require certain design and equipment modifications to attain its fully intended operating functionality 
these modifications occurred during the second half of with completion and restart occurring in the first quarter of while idi believed that many of the design and equipment deficiencies were corrected with these modifications  the company halted operations at idi during july  as a result of higher than expected start up and process refinement costs  lower than expected production quantities  exceptionally high energy costs and then historically low steel scrap pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  idi successfully completed certain operating trials utilizing a modified production process 
this process reduced the per unit cost of liquid pig iron production 
throughout  the company invested million for capital expenditures required to implement this modified production process  and iron dynamics restarted operations mid november during  idi produced  tonnes of hot briquetted iron and after starting the submerged arc furnace in june  produced  tonnes of liquid pig iron during the second half of we are one of four investors in mesabi nugget  llc  an entity that is also pioneering a process to produce an iron substitute in the form of nuggets  or small pellets 
a pilot plant successfully implemented the process and verified its validity 
we are currently working with the other investors to proceed with a commercial scale plant that has an estimated annual production capacity of  tonnes of iron nuggets 
income statement classifications net sales 
our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns  sales discounts  return allowances and claims from total sales 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  dimensions of product  or certain smaller volumes  based on our cost of production 
we also charge marginally higher prices for our value added products 
these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products  cold rolled products  and painted products from our flat roll division and certain special bar quality products from our bar products division 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor and related benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation  materials and transportation  and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant component of our cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  and administrative departments 
these costs include labor and benefits  professional services  financing cost amortization  property taxes  profit sharing expense and start up costs associated with new projects 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing  net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including gains on certain short term investments 
other expense consists of any non operating costs  including settlement costs from litigation efforts 

back to contents operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted shared during  compared with million or 
per diluted share during this increase in our net income during was due to increased selling values and shipping volumes 
gross profit 
during our net sales increased billion  or  to billion and our consolidated shipments increased  tons  or  to million tons  compared with the increase in consolidated shipments was primarily due to increased shipments to external customers of  tons from our bar products division  which started commercial operations during the first quarter of  and an increase of  tons from our structural and rail division  which completed its second full year of operations 
our average consolidated selling price for increased to per ton compared with as shown in the following table  our quarterly pricing has continued to increase during the year and we anticipate a slight increase to continue into the first quarter of q q q q ytd average consolidated selling price average consolidated selling price we continue to see signs of a strengthening us economy and we experienced a related increase in demand and product base pricing during  however  our increase in selling values during that time was also due in part to the steel industry s initiation of a surcharge mechanism at the beginning of this surcharge is derived from an indexed scrap number and designed to pass some of the increased costs associated with rising metallic prices through to the industry s customers 
our average annual metallic raw material cost per net ton charged increased when compared with the following table shows the quarterly increases in our cost of metallic raw materials per net ton charged throughout q q q q increase in quarterly metallic raw material costs metallic raw materials  specifically steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant cost component of our steel operation s production processes 
as a percentage of total cost of goods sold during  these costs represented  an increase of compared with this increase in the cost of our primary raw material as a percentage of our total manufacturing costs necessitated the surcharge 
we anticipate a decrease in our raw material costs during the first quarter of due to reduced steel scrap pricing already experienced during the quarter 
if these costs fall from historical highs  the surcharge will also decline and may eventually cease to be utilized in our product price determination  however  our product base prices will continue to fluctuate with market demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributed to increased profit sharing expense of million  which correlates to the increase in our pretax earnings 
our profit sharing pool is calculated as a percentage of our pretax earnings 
during and the first half of the profit sharing pool was based on of pretax earnings 
during the second half of  upon approval of our board of directors  the allocation was increased to 
during and  selling general and administrative expense represented of net sales 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense increased to million and capitalized interest decreased  to million  as compared to during we recorded interest expense of million in conjunction with a one time short term us treasury bond transaction 
the interest capitalization that occurred during resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products and structural and rail divisions 

back to contents other income expense 
other income was million during  as compared to other expense of  during during the first quarter of we entered into a short term us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains 
this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter and we recorded associated gains of million during we also recorded a million gain from the early extinguishment of debt associated with our structural and rail division during the second quarter of income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate was throughout and for the first half of we fully utilized all of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards during we increased our effective income tax rate to effective july  due to increased profitability during the year 
we again increased our effective income tax rate to beginning january  in anticipation of the year s expected profitability levels and the resulting impact on our state income taxes 
operating results vs 
net income was million or 
per diluted shared during  compared with million or per diluted share during this decrease in our net income during was due to dramatically increased costs of our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitute 
gross profit 
during  our consolidated net sales increased million  or  to million and our consolidated shipments increased  tons  or  to million tons  compared with these increases were due primarily to being the first full year of operations for our structural and rail division 
we had structural sales to external customers of million and shipments of  tons during  a million increase in sales and  ton increase in shipments from structural products accounted for of our consolidated shipments during  compared to during our average consolidated selling price decreased per ton to per ton during our flat roll division accounted for of our consolidated net sales during  and its pricing decreased approximately per ton compared to domestic flat rolled steel product pricing decreased during the first half of  compared to the last half of  due in part to the weakened economy and added domestic flat rolled production capacity 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  during to million compared with as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold represented approximately and during the years and  respectively 
we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout as our average sales price per ton increased more slowly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton  which is the most significant single component of our cost of goods sold 
metallic raw materials represented and of our cost of goods sold during and  respectively 
we experienced a steady increase in metallic costs from the first quarter of through the end of and we anticipated further increases during the first half of our metallic raw material cost increased per net ton charged during  while our average consolidated sales price decreased per ton 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales during  as compared to million  or of net sales during a portion of these expenses in both years was attributable to performance related employee incentive programs and facility start up costs 
costs associated with our performance related employee profit sharing plan decreased million during as compared to  which was a record year for pre tax income prior to results 
during  costs associated with start up activities at our bar products division  principally  were million compared to start up costs during of million  which related most significantly to our structural and rail division 

back to contents interest expense 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase in our net interest expense during was due to a decrease of million in interest required to be capitalized in connection with our construction projects 
our gross interest expense remained relatively flat at million during gain from debt extinguishment 
in january  we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at the end of march there was a provision within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january   and generated positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement  we would be required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
during december  by agreement with the iron dynamics lenders  we paid million in cash to the idi lenders  terminating all of our obligations to make any additional future payments under the settlement agreement 
our financial statements reflect an ordinary non cash gain of million from the extinguishment of the million contingent liability 
other income expense 
other expense was  during  as compared to million during during  we recorded settlement costs of million  net of insurance proceeds  in association with the nsm related lawsuits 
income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective tax rate was and for  and  respectively 
during  we realized a million valuation allowance that was created in for foreign tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
working capital 
during  our operational working capital position  representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased million to million compared to december  due to higher selling prices and increased sales volume  trade receivables increased million during to million  of which were current or less than days past due 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented and of our outstanding trade receivables at december  and  respectively 
during our inventories increased million to million  due primarily to the increased cost and volume of our metallic raw materials on hand and also to the start up production of our bar products division 
our metallic raw materials on hand increased  tons  or million  at december  compared to december  metallic scrap prices decreased during december  therefore  we purchased some additional inventories for future use to benefit from these reduced costs 
our trade payables increased million during  a significant portion of which was associated with the amount we owed various vendors for metallic raw material purchases 
capital expenditures 
during we invested million in property  plant and equipment related to our new divisions and improvement projects in our existing facilities 
approximately of our capital investments were related to the conversion of our bar products division and were related to the expansion of our new millennium joist and deck operations with the addition of its second plant 
we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project continues to develop 
capital resources 
during our total outstanding debt  including unamortized bond premium  decreased by million to million 
our long term debt to capitalization ratio decreased from at the end of to at december  we prepaid several state and local government bond issues  
back to contents electric utility loans and new millennium s credit facility  as well as reducing our senior secured debt by million during october on june   we completed a refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities and entered into a new year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
our senior secured credit agreement is secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property assets  by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries  and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and inter company debt held by us and each wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured credit agreement 
the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on our property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
our ability to draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 
due to the increasing interest rate environment during and anticipated in  we entered into two forward interest rate agreements during january to lock the six month libor setting of our million fair value interest rate swap which resets each march and september at six month libor in arrears plus 
we locked the six month libor in arrears settings at for the interest reset date of march  and at for the interest reset date of september  our new senior secured credit agreement allows us to pay cash dividends dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants within the agreement 
during the fourth quarter our board of directors declared our third cash dividend 
the dividend of 
ten cents per common share was paid on january  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  the aggregate dividend payment was million 
on october  we also announced our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock to be made from time to time based upon the market price of our stock  the nature of other investment opportunities present  our cash flows from operations  and general economic conditions 
we terminated our existing share repurchase plan and amended our senior secured credit facility as a result of this approval 
at december   we had repurchased million shares in the open market at an average price of per share 
we repurchased an additional million shares from january  through january   at an average of price of per share 
we have approximately million shares still authorized to be repurchased pursuant to our current share repurchase plan 
in january  we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics lenders to extinguish its senior secured debt of million during march the settlement agreement required us to pay million in cash and issue an aggregate of million of steel dynamics common stock to the lender group 
in addition  there was a provision within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january   and generated positive cash flow  we would be required to make payments to the iron dynamics lenders in an aggregate amount not to exceed the remaining unpaid million  thus potentially requiring the repayment of the entire million outstanding 
we complied with each of the settlement requirements  thus constituting full and final settlement of all of iron dynamics obligations and the steel dynamics guarantees under the iron dynamics credit agreement 
at december   the contingent future payments were reflected as an other long term contingent liability within our financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  which in this circumstance would not allow a gain or loss to be recorded on the restructured payable as long as there was a possibility of the lenders being repaid in full 
during december  by agreement with the iron dynamics lenders  we paid million in cash to the iron dynamics lenders  terminating all of our obligations to make any additional 
back to contents future payments under the settlement agreement  therefore  our financial statements reflect a non cash gain of million from the extinguishment of the million contingent liability 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance  which in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements and funding anticipated capital expenditures 
during  we anticipate spending approximately million on capital expenditures  with approximately million to million in connection with a joint venture investment in the commercial development of a scrap substitute facility utilizing the mesabi nugget project technology  million in connection our the expansion of our new millennium building systems operations with the completion of its second plant and the initiation of is third plant  million in connection with various smaller individual projects at our flat roll  structural and rail  and bar products divisions  and million related to operations at iron dynamics 
at december   we had outstanding contractual obligations of million related to these planned capital expenditures 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million and  during the years through  respectively 
contractual obligations and other long term liabilities 
we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted account principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts  which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt estimated interest payments on debt and interest rate swap payments purchase obligations construction commitments total 
back to contents the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes and our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding until maturity 
the earliest dates at which redemption or repurchase may occur for our million senior unsecured notes is march  and for our million convertible subordinated notes is december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our long term debt 
the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of on our million senior unsecured notes due march   on our million convertible subordinated notes due december   on our variable rate debt primarily composed of a senior secured revolving credit facility due june  and on our other fixed rate debt of approximately million 
purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process 
these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions 
we have fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of million 
approximately of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
no environmental remediation costs were incurred during and there were no outstanding contingent matters related to environmental remediation  therefore  there were no related accruals recorded at december  we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r fas r  share based payment  a revision of fas  supersedes apb and amends fas  statement of cash flows 
among other items  fas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of fas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which for us is the third quarter of fas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of fas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of fas r 

back to contents under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same  but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous period based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with fas we currently utilize the black scholes standard option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
fas r permits companies to continue to use such a model or to use a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of fas r 
we expect to adopt fas r effective july  in november  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  fas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
fas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we currently believe that the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
this issue requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in the computation of diluted earrings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf is effective for all periods ending after december  and requires retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share 
we adopted eitf during the fourth quarter of and restated our diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and  to include the potentially dilutive effect of the company s million subordinated convertible notes of which million were issued in december and million were issued in january in march  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for investments in limited liability companies  effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the issue relates to the accounting by the investor for investments in the common stock of limited liability companies that are not consolidated 
the eitf concluded that an investment in a limited liability company that maintains a specific ownership account for each investor  similar to a partnership capital account structure  should be viewed as similar to an investment in a limited partnership for purposes of determining whether a noncontrolling investment in a limited liability company should be accounted for using the cost method or the equity method 
we adopted eitf during the third quarter of with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements and provides guidance related to a company s initial and subsequent measurement of newly consolidated vies 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  limited liability corporation  trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out is principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or  a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns  or both 
fin r must be applied to all entities subject to this interpretation as of march  however  prior to the required application of this interpretation  fin r must be applied to those entities that are considered to be special purpose entities as of december  there was no financial statement impact from the application of this interpretation 

back to contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel joist and steel decking operation  new millennium building systems  recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract 
new millennium accounted for of our net sales 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
impairments of long lived assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
during  we were unable to utilize a million foreign tax credit carryforward  which we had created a valuation allowance of million for in therefore  the valuation allowance was realized in as of december   we had no net operating loss carryforwards or capital loss carryforwards available 

back to contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate principal average rate principal average rate expected maturity date thereafter total fair value commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas and alloys 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
during  approximately of our net sales were under fixed price contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities 
certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to years 
during the years ending december  and  we have commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for approximately million and million  respectively 
we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years and purchased million  million and million  during the years ended december   and  respectively  under these contracts 
we believe that our production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours as interruptible service during  and these interruptible hours further decrease annually through expiration of the agreement 
the contract also establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement
