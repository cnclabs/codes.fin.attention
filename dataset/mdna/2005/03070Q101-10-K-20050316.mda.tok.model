leading our markets in slot technology slot machines are the core driver of our casino business 
we believe that leading our markets in slot machine trends is essential to our success 
the most significant innovation in slots today is ticket in  ticket out  which creates a more convenient coinless gambling experience for our customers and increases the revenue we earn on each machine 
we led our markets in the introduction of this technology and currently approximately of the slot machines at our ameristar branded properties have ticket in  ticket out capability 
we were also the first operator in our markets to introduce a large supply of new generation nickel and penny video reel slot machines 
although many of our competitors now offer these machines  we believe that we gained a significant competitive advantage by leading this trend 
we also continue to focus on the most appropriate product mix 
we continually analyze slot utilization and slot machine win per unit to determine the most profitable slot machine mix 
branding and marketing our branding and marketing efforts are designed to support each of our properties as the number one casino and entertainment destination in their respective markets

hands on management since the inception of the company  we have developed a number of best practice processes and strategies for our operations 
we believe we have enhanced our revenues and minimized our costs by practicing a hands on management approach at the property and corporate levels

table of contents guest service  player development  team member relations  food quality  etc 
future expansion we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations through a variety of means  including entering new north american or overseas markets created by the legalization or expansion of casino gaming  developing new casinos or buying existing casinos in established north american casino gaming markets and expanding through continued growth at our existing properties 
although our preference is to own and operate each of our gaming properties  we may also consider expansion opportunities involving management contracts or joint ventures 
we continue to explore expansion opportunities in the united kingdom in anticipation of the expected reform of that country s casino gaming laws that would allow large scale modern casinos to be developed in a limited number of locations throughout the united kingdom 
primary reform legislation is pending in parliament  although we have no assurance as to whether or when legislation will be enacted 
the development of modern casinos would further require the adoption of planning and tax policies conducive to attract development  the formation of a new regulatory agency and the adoption of regulations 
during  the commonwealth of pennsylvania enacted legislation authorizing slot machines at pari mutuel racetracks and a limited number of non track locations in pennsylvania  including at two sites to be selected in philadelphia 
we have acquired an option on a acre site in philadelphia and are pursuing a gaming license for that site 
we continually review the operating performance of each of our existing properties and the feasibility of enhancing their performance through targeted capital expenditure programs 
in doing so  we assess the anticipated relative costs and benefits of the projects under consideration  the availability of cash flows and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and competitive and other relevant factors

competition st

charles competes with four other gaming operations located in the metropolitan st 
louis area 
two of these competitors are located in the state of illinois 
unlike the state of missouri  illinois does not impose a per person buy in limit  does not require a casino issued identification card to enter a casino and allows credit play 
however  illinois casinos are limited in the number of gaming positions allowed and are subject to a higher rate of gaming taxes than missouri casinos 
in the third quarter of  our principal competitor completed an million expansion  which included an additional room hotel tower  the addition of two new restaurants  as well as several other non gaming amenities 
there were no other major capital improvements or expansions in the st 
louis market in the st 
louis gaming market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets 
in the third quarter of  the missouri gaming commission prioritized for investigation a gaming license application for a new casino license located in lemay  in the southeastern portion of st 
louis county 
the proposed million development would consist of a  square foot casino  room hotel and  parking spaces and is slated for completion in late at the same time  the missouri gaming commission prioritized for investigation a gaming license application by the same developer for a new facility at laclede s landing in downtown st 
louis 
the proposed million development would consist of a  square foot casino  room hotel and  parking spaces and is projected to open in late in october  another operator agreed to purchase the existing president casino located in downtown st

the new owner of the president has announced plans to enhance the current facility 
the alton belle casino in alton  illinois  across the mississippi river from downtown st 
louis  is expected to undergo a change in control in connection with the acquisition of its parent company by another gaming company  which acquisition is expected to close in mid the acquiring company has not announced plans for any changes it may make at the alton belle 
the addition of two gaming licenses in the st 
louis market  as well as any replacement or upgrade to the president or alton belle casinos  would result in additional competition for ameristar st 
charles 
the state of illinois has one dormant gaming license that it has announced it intends to reissue in the greater chicago area 
accordingly  we do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market 
kansas city 
table of contents ameristar kansas city competes with three other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
in december  argosy casino  located approximately miles from ameristar kansas city  replaced its existing three level casino riverboat with a single level   square foot barge based facility

in  the electorate of the state of nebraska considered various proposals to legalize casino gaming 
none of the referenda were approved  which approvals could have had a material impact on the council bluffs casino gaming market 
in the future  the state of nebraska may again consider legalization of casino gaming which  if passed  would likely result in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
see risk factors for further discussion of these matters 
vicksburg ameristar vicksburg competes with three other gaming operations located in vicksburg 
in october  a change of ownership occurred at one of ameristar vicksburg s competitors 
we believe that the change in ownership has benefited ameristar vicksburg through an increase in market share 
one competitor completed a million renovation of its hotel rooms and public areas in the fourth quarter of and has undertaken a million project to construct a new seat buffet 
the buffet is expected to be completed in mid there were no major capital improvements or expansions by the remaining two vicksburg market competitors in the vicksburg market also faces regional competition from two casinos owned by a 
table of contents native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg 
several potential gaming sites still exist in or near vicksburg and from time to time potential competitors have proposed the development of additional casinos 
in february  the mississippi gaming commission granted preliminary approval for a fifth casino license in the vicksburg market 
the developer has proposed building a casino facility which includes a room hotel  parking garage and other non gaming amenities 
if other required approvals are obtained  this project could open in early in addition  proposals have been made from time to time to develop additional native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market if completed 
black hawk mountain high casino competes with approximately other gaming operations located in the black hawk and central city gaming market in colorado 
of the competing casinos  only five are considered large competitors  with over  square feet of gaming space 
mountain high casino has one of the largest gaming floors of any casino in the black hawk market 
mountain high casino s primary competitor is the isle of capri  which is one of the first major casinos one encounters when entering black hawk from denver via route isle of capri is in the process of completing a million expansion of its property and the adjacent colorado central station property which it purchased in the expansion of the combined properties will increase the number of hotel rooms and parking capacity and connect the two properties via an enclosed skywalk 
a partial expansion of the parking complex and gaming area was completed in the fourth quarter of the remainder of the parking and hotel complex is scheduled for completion in early the black hawk central city gaming market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
however  there have been several proposals for the development of a native american casino located in the denver metropolitan area 
should a casino development in the denver area occur  the black hawk central city market would face increased competition 
see risk factors for more information 
jackpot the jackpot properties compete with four other hotels and motels three of which also have casinos in jackpot 
there were no major capital improvements or expansions in the jackpot market in we are not aware of any other expansion plans by existing or potential competitors in jackpot in the near future  however  casinos with video lottery terminals vlt similar to slot machines are operated on native american land in idaho  including one near pocatello with approximately vlt machines that is operated by the shoshone bannock tribes 
in november  the idaho electorate passed proposition  which legalized specific ticket pay gaming machines on native american reservations in the state  along with a limited growth plan allowing an increase of in machine count per year  not to exceed over the next years  with a subsequent renegotiation of compacts thereafter 
a legal challenge to proposition 
table of contents has been filed and is currently pending 
litigation is also pending concerning the scope of gaming permitted under the compact between the state of idaho and the shoshone bannock tribes 
in addition  casino gaming on native american lands in both western washington and northeastern oregon has been in operation for several years and casinos also operate in alberta  canada 
employees and labor relations as of march   we employed approximately  full and part time employees 
none of our employees is employed pursuant to collective bargaining or other union arrangements  although a teamsters union local recently unsuccessfully attempted to organize a group of beverage employees at ameristar kansas city 
we believe our employee relations are good 
incorporation ameristar was incorporated in nevada in risk factors the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
we may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain customers 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
from time to time  legislation and ballot measures have been unsuccessfully proposed in kansas  nebraska and colorado for the legalization or expansion of gaming 
in nebraska  several referenda on the statewide ballot that would have legalized two alternative forms of casino gaming were defeated in november in both nebraska and kansas  bills have been introduced from time to time in the legislature for the legalization of casino gaming  several of which are currently pending in kansas 
these proposals would authorize gaming in or near  among other places  omaha  nebraska and kansas city  kansas  in close proximity to our existing facilities in council bluffs  iowa and kansas city  missouri  respectively 
the legalization of gaming in these locations and the additional competition resulting from the subsequent development of competing gaming properties could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents the missouri gaming commission has prioritized for investigation gaming license applications for new casino facilities in downtown st 
louis and southeastern st 
louis county  approximately miles and miles  respectively  from ameristar st 
charles 
st 
louis city officials and members of the missouri gaming commission have also stated that they would like to see a currently operating casino in downtown st 
louis improved or replaced 
if any of these developments is successfully completed  we will face additional or enhanced competition 
our competitor that operates the pari mutuel racetrack casino in council bluffs recently announced plans to rebrand the property as part of a major expansion and renovation 
upon completion  which is expected to occur in the first quarter of  the property will include more gaming space   slot machines  table games  a poker room and additional non gaming amenities 
prior to a change in iowa law in  racetrack casinos were not permitted to offer table games or video poker machines 
the future operating results of ameristar council bluffs may be adversely affected by the additional competition 
our principal competitors in the st 
louis and black hawk markets have also recently completed  or will soon complete  significant expansions of their facilities 
in vicksburg  several potential gaming sites still exist  and one company has recently received preliminary mississippi gaming commission approval for the development of a new casino 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
we believe that recent operating results at our jackpot properties have been adversely affected by intensified competition from an idaho native american facility that is closer to a portion of our market area 
the legislatures in kansas and nebraska are considering pending legislation that would allow various forms of native american gaming in close proximity to our properties in kansas city and council bluffs 
additionally  two federally recognized tribes have asserted land claims in colorado and are attempting to have land in metropolitan denver placed in trust by the federal government to be used for casino gaming 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits such as currently exist in many states may intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in  large gaming tax increases were enacted in illinois and indiana 
in  illinois enacted an additional large gaming tax increase  the state of new jersey increased various taxes on casinos 
table of contents and casino patrons and the state of nevada increased its tax on gross gaming revenues from to 
in  in response to an iowa supreme court ruling that decreased the gaming taxes payable by casinos at pari mutuel racetracks  the iowa legislature approved an increase in the maximum tax rate on gaming revenues of riverboat casinos from to  effective july  we will also be required to pay a special additional assessment of approximately million in each of and  which is recoverable as a credit against future gaming taxes beginning in this tax increase has negatively impacted operating income at ameristar council bluffs and will continue to do so 
several bills have been introduced in the missouri legislature in recent years that would increase the gaming tax rate  and similar legislation has been introduced in the current session 
in colorado  the colorado limited gaming control commission has the authority to establish the gaming tax rate on an annual basis  up to a maximum rate of of gross receipts  without further legislative action 
the current rate of on gross receipts over million has been in effect since if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to further increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the buy in limit in missouri  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission  the colorado limited gaming control commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our licenses in missouri need to be renewed every two years  our gaming licenses in iowa and colorado must be renewed or continued every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits 
table of contents and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
financial leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
our leverage ratio as defined in our senior credit facilities has improved from as of december  to as of december   while our total indebtedness has increased from million as of december  to million as of december  due to increased borrowing to fund our acquisition of mountain high casino 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions dividends and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
the terms of our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities and the indenture are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities and the indenture 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
we will soon need to obtain replacement financing 
our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility mature in december and december  respectively 
additionally  without any change to the existing terms of our senior credit facilities  it is likely that we would violate covenants relating to permitted dividend payments  the maximum senior debt ratio and permitted capital expenditures during the second 
table of contents half of accordingly  we will be required to refinance our senior debt in the near future 
we can offer no assurance as to the terms of any such refinancing that may be available 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
all of our borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as of december   we had outstanding under our senior credit facilities and million in other long term debt that bears interest at variable rates 
if short term interest rates continue to rise  our interest cost will increase  which will adversely affect our net income and available cash 
worsening economic conditions or geopolitical circumstances may adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by economic downturns and instability  as we are dependent on discretionary spending by our customers 
any worsening of current economic conditions could cause fewer people to spend money at our properties and could adversely affect our revenues 
other geopolitical events  such as terrorism or the threat of terrorism  may deter customers from visiting our properties 
we have limited opportunities to grow our business 
the casino gaming industry has limited growth opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business 
craig h 
neilsen owns a majority of our common stock and controls our affairs 
mr 
neilsen is our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and he owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  mr 
neilsen has the ability to control our operations and affairs  including the election of the entire board of directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders  including a merger  consolidation or sale of assets 
as a result  actions which may be supported by a majority of the other stockholders could be blocked by mr 
neilsen 
in addition  mr 
neilsen s substantial ownership affects the liquidity in the market for our common stock 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event mr 
neilsen sells a significant portion of his stock or upon his death if his estate  private foundation  heirs or 
table of contents devisees sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they might have to do in order to pay estate tax liabilities or satisfy legal requirements applicable to shareholdings by private foundations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we employ fast track design and construction methods in some of our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe that the use of fast track design and construction methods can reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve additional construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among 
table of contents other factors  the amount of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
if any of our key personnel leaves us  our business may be significantly affected 
we depend on the continued performance of craig h 
neilsen  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and the rest of our management team 
if we lose the services of mr 
neilsen  any of our other key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market for qualified property and corporate management personnel is subject to intense competition 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel is particularly difficult at ameristar vicksburg  mountain high casino and the jackpot properties due to local market conditions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
adverse weather conditions in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if our midwestern and colorado properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and barge facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
in addition  us coast guard regulations set limits on the operation of vessels and require that vessels be operated by a minimum complement of licensed personnel 

table of contents the us coast guard also requires all united states flagged passenger vessels operating exclusively in fresh water to conduct a thorough dry dock inspection of underwater machinery  valves and hull every five years 
less stringent inspection requirements apply to permanently moored barges like those at ameristar kansas city  ameristar st 
charles and ameristar vicksburg 
the ameristar council bluffs riverboat was scheduled for its dry dock inspection in october  but we have been accepted into a us coast guard program that has extended the dry dock requirement until april by agreeing to undergo a thorough underwater inspection in october a dry dock inspection would take the council bluffs casino out of service for a substantial period of time  which could have a material adverse effect on ameristar council bluffs 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced some ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel floats  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps  if any  may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or barge facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities in an amount that we are unable to reasonably estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our credit agreement 
we could face severe penalties and material remediation costs if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
as is the case with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts  which could adversely affect our operations 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities 
government regulation the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
we are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming 
the limitation  conditioning or suspension of gaming licenses could and the revocation or non renewal of gaming licenses  or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions  would materially adversely affect our operations in that jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in law that restrict or prohibit our gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on us

mississippi the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the state of mississippi are subject to extensive state and local regulation but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the mississippi gaming commission the mississippi commission 

table of contents the mississippi gaming control act the mississippi act is similar to the nevada gaming control act 
the mississippi commission has adopted regulations that are also similar in many respects to the nevada gaming regulations 
the laws  regulations and supervisory procedures of the mississippi commission are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with  among other things  the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity  the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures  the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees  including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues  providing for reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the mississippi commission  the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices  providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees  and ensuring that gaming licensees  to the extent practicable  employ mississippi residents 
the regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the mississippi commission 
we believe that our compliance with the licensing procedures and regulatory requirements of the mississippi commission will not affect the marketability of our securities 
changes in mississippi laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on us and our mississippi gaming operations 
the mississippi act provides for legalized dockside gaming in each of the counties that border the gulf coast or the mississippi river  but only if the voters in the county have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county 
in recent years  certain anti gaming groups proposed for adoption through the initiative and referendum process certain amendments to the mississippi constitution  which would prohibit gaming in the state 
the proposals were declared illegal by mississippi courts on constitutional and procedural grounds 
the latest ruling was appealed to the mississippi supreme court  which affirmed the decision of the lower court 
if another such proposal were to be made and if a sufficient number of signatures were to be gathered to place a legal initiative on the ballot  it would be possible for the voters of mississippi to consider such a proposal in november while we are unable to predict whether such an initiative will appear on a ballot or the likelihood of such an initiative being approved by the voters  if such an initiative were approved and gaming were prohibited in mississippi  it would have a significant adverse effect on us and our operations 
currently  dockside gaming is permissible in nine of the eligible counties in the state and gaming operations have commenced in seven counties

we acquired mountain high casino on december  our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts that patrons spend per visit 
management uses various metrics to evaluate these factors 
key metrics include market share  representing our share of gross gaming revenues in each of our markets other than jackpot and our share of gaming devices in the jackpot market nevada does not publish separate gaming revenue statistics for this market  admissions  representing the number of patrons admitted to our riverboat casinos  and win per admission  representing the amount of gaming revenues we generate per admission

the senior credit facilities limit our aggregate capital expenditures in each year 
for the year ended december   giving effect to an amendment to the credit agreement in december  our maximum permitted capital expenditures were a combination of of our consolidated gross revenues million and of unused permitted capitalized expenditures from million  totaling million 
as of december   we were in compliance with the capital expenditure covenant 
liquidity our principal long term debt at december  consisted of our secured senior credit facilities and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due at december   the senior credit facilities consisted of a million revolving credit facility with no outstanding debt and term loan b with million outstanding 
as of december   the amount of the revolving credit facility available for borrowing was million  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  in february  we amended the senior credit facilities 
the primary elements of the amendment included the consolidation of the former revolving term loan facility  term loan a and term loan b into new term loan b  which matures on december   a reduction in the applicable interest rate margin on term loan b compared to the former term 
table of contents loan b  a revised repayment schedule  and the ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock in a total amount of up to million 
in october  we further amended our senior credit facilities in order to permit the december  borrowing of an additional million under term loan b of the senior credit facilities 
we used the loan proceeds to fund the acquisition of mountain high casino 
all mandatory principal repayments have been made through december  we expect to fund principal repayments from cash flows from operating activities in significant principal repayments will be required on term loan b in we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants under the senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
these covenants include  among other things  restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions  as well as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
we anticipate that we will amend or replace the senior credit facilities during the second half of while we believe we will be able to do so on attractive terms  we cannot give assurance of this 
without any change to the senior credit facilities  it is likely that we would violate covenants relating to permitted dividend payments  the maximum senior debt ratio and permitted capital expenditures during the second half of in  we made federal and state tax payments  net of million in state tax refunds  of million 
in january  we received a million federal income tax refund related to the tax year as our actual taxable income for the year was significantly lower than the estimates used to calculate quarterly installments 
additionally  in we made federal and state tax payments  net of million in state tax refunds  of million 
in  we paid million in estimated federal income tax payments through quarterly installments 
at december   we had available million of federal and million of state unused operating loss carryforwards that may be applied against future taxable income  including tax cash payments that we are required to make in we intend to utilize earnings to fund the operation of our business  to service and repay our debt  to fund internal development projects  to invest in future growth opportunities that diversify our revenues and to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
we anticipate spending approximately million on maintenance capital expenditures including the acquisition of slot machines and other long lived assets and approximately million on internal expansion projects 
actual capital expenditures will depend on the start date of certain projects and the progress of construction through year end 
our planned internal expansion projects include the reconfiguration and expansion of the gaming area  additional covered parking  an upgrade of the food and beverage outlets and construction of a room aaa four diamond quality hotel at our newly acquired mountain high casino property  the renovation of hotel rooms at our council bluffs and kansas city properties  which began in the fourth quarter of  the expansion of our gaming space at ameristar council bluffs and ameristar vicksburg to accommodate increases of and slot machines  respectively  and the addition of a poker room at both properties  and the construction of a room  all suite hotel   square 
table of contents feet of meeting facilities  a new  seat entertainment pavilion and an additional parking garage at ameristar st 
charles 
we anticipate the benefit associated with these internal growth projects will primarily be realized commencing in and that we will experience construction disruption from the projects that will negatively impact our financial results in in april  the iowa legislature approved an increase in the maximum tax rate on gaming revenues of riverboat casinos from to  effective july  we will also be required to pay a special additional assessment of approximately million in each of and  which is recoverable as a credit against future gaming taxes beginning in this tax increase will negatively impact operating income at ameristar council bluffs in future periods 
historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
it is possible that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and availability under our senior credit facilities will not be able to support our operations and liquidity requirements  including all of our currently planned capital expenditures 
if our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet such needs  we will be required to seek additional borrowings or scale back our capital plans 
while we believe we will have access to additional funds on attractive terms  we cannot provide assurance of that 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us  including our ability to fund daily operations and to satisfy debt covenants 
our ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facilities at any time is primarily dependent upon the amount of our ebitda  as defined for purposes of our senior credit facilities  for the preceding four fiscal quarters 
as of december   in addition to the million available for borrowing under the senior credit facilities  we had million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of which were required for daily operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission regulation s k 

table of contents contractual and other commitments the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contracts  including long term debt obligations  capitalized leases  operating leases and certain construction contracts 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations after total long term debt instruments operating leases material construction contracts total excludes million discount on long term debt and does not include estimated future interest payments 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commitments after total letters of credit we were not required to make significant cash payments for federal income taxes during the past three years due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  the alternative minimum tax credit of approximately million at december  can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce future federal income tax liabilities 
we anticipate making increased cash tax payments in the internal revenue service is currently conducting an examination of our federal tax returns for through the amount of our cash tax payments required in will be determined in part by the outcome of the irs examination  which may result in a reduction of the currently available net operating loss carryforwards 
we do not expect our cash tax payments in to exceed million 
another significant operating use of cash in is interest payments 
our cash interest payments  excluding capitalized interest  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect our cash interest payments to increase in as a result of an anticipated larger average outstanding debt balance as compared to  which is further described in note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
during december  we assumed several agreements with the missouri highway transportation development district development district that had been entered into in 
table of contents order to assist the development district in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the ameristar kansas city property 
in order to pay for the highway improvement project  the development district issued revenue bonds totaling million in principal amount with scheduled maturities from through we have issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a bank in support of obligations of the development district for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds 
the amount outstanding under this letter of credit was million as of december  and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds 
additionally  we are obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds as well as any costs incurred by the development district that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders 
through december   we had paid million in shortfalls and other costs 
as required by the agreements  we anticipate that we will be reimbursed for these shortfall payments by the development district from future available cash flow  as defined  and have recorded a corresponding receivable as of december  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our senior credit facilities 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 

table of contents excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired at december  we had approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of the missouri properties in december according to the requirements of sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   we completed our annual assessment for impairment and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the assessment requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine its estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
star awards program our customer reward program  star awards  allows customers to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
customers can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a customer does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were accrued 
the value of these point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services are netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
cash coupons our former  current and future gaming customers may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play  are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days and are redeemable only on a return visit 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical insurance coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities  based upon statistical data provided by the independent third party administrators of the various programs 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
income taxes we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states and state income taxes in several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and million of deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue services and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on historical precedent 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
recently issued accounting standards on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision to sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  including employee stock options and restricted stock  granted to employees 
sfas no 
r will become effective for us in the quarter ending september  sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are still assessing the appropriate transition method 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an impact on our results of operations  but it will not have any impact on our overall financial position 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r to determine its impact on our future financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to 
table of contents be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facilities  bearing interest at variable rates 
other than the borrowings under the senior credit facilities and million in other long term debt outstanding at december  collectively  the variable rate debt  all of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
the variable rate debt bears interest equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the variable rate debt was 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the variable rate debt outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost by approximately million 
we continue to monitor interest rate markets and may enter into interest rate collar or swap agreements or other derivative instruments for additional amounts of principal under the senior credit facilities as market conditions warrant
