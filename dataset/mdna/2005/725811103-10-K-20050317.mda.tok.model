our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled risk factors in item of this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included on pages of this form k 
overview pixar was formed in when steve jobs purchased the computer division of lucasfilm and incorporated it as a separate company 
in  we entered into a feature film agreement the feature film agreement with 
table of contents walt disney pictures  a wholly owned subsidiary of the walt disney company together with its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively referred to herein as disney  for the development and production of up to three animated feature films to be marketed and distributed by disney 
it was pursuant to the feature film agreement that toy story was developed  produced  and distributed 
our share of revenues and expenses from toy story is governed by the terms of the feature film agreement 
in february  we entered into the co production agreement which  except for certain economic provisions applicable to toy story  superseded the feature film agreement with disney pursuant to which we  on an exclusive basis  agreed to produce five original computer animated feature length theatrical motion pictures the pictures for distribution by disney 
pixar and disney agreed to co finance the production costs of the pictures  co own the pictures with disney having exclusive distribution and exploitation rights  co brand the pictures  and share equally in the profits of each picture and any related merchandise as well as other ancillary products  after recovery of all marketing and distribution costs which disney finances  a distribution fee paid to disney and any other predefined fees or costs  including any participations provided to talent 
the co production agreement generally provides that we will be responsible for the production of each picture  while disney will be responsible for the marketing  promotion  publicity  advertising and distribution of each picture 
the co production agreement also contemplates that with respect to theatrical sequels  made for home video sequels  television productions  interactive media products and other derivative works related to the pictures  we will have the opportunity to co finance and produce such products or to earn passive royalties on such products 
we will not share in any theme park revenues generated as a result of the pictures 
pursuant to the co production agreement  in addition to co financing the production costs of the pictures  disney will reimburse us for our share of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions of the pictures 
our second feature film  a bug s life  was released in november and counted as the first original picture under the co production agreement 
in november  toy story  our third animated feature film was released 
as a theatrical sequel  toy story is a derivative work of the original toy story and therefore it does not count toward the five original pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
as a derivative work  toy story is treated as a picture under the co production agreement  and all the provisions applicable to the five original pictures apply 
in november  we released monsters  inc  our fourth animated feature film  which counts as the second original picture under the co production agreement 
in may  we released finding nemo  our fifth animated feature film  which counts as the third original picture under the co production agreement 
in november  we released the incredibles  our sixth animated feature film  which counts as the fourth original picture under the co production agreement 
we are currently in production on cars  which is scheduled for release on june  cars will be produced and distributed under the co production agreement and will count as the fifth and final film of the pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
we are also in production on our first feature film outside of our disney relationship 
the term of the co production agreement continues until we deliver our fifth and final picture  cars  to disney 
however  since our april delivery of finding nemo to disney  we have had the right to negotiate and enter into another distribution agreement with any third party 
in january  we announced that we had ended our discussions with disney regarding extending our relationship with them by entering into a new arrangement for films released beyond cars 
since that time  we have had preliminary meetings with various major motion picture studios regarding a potential distribution agreement for the films we release after cars  and we continue to explore our options with respect to a future distribution agreement 
we have produced six highly successful films to date  and we believe that this success  combined with our strong financial resources  position us to negotiate a new distribution arrangement with a major studio that will provide us with  among other things  better economic terms than we currently have under the co production agreement and full ownership of our films 
with respect to the distribution of our films after cars  we currently are not pursuing alternatives  other than entering into such an agreement with a major studio 

table of contents although we look forward to a more favorable distribution agreement for films released after cars  we also understand that distributing our films through another studio may increase some of the risks we face in the motion picture industry 
see relationship with disney  risk factors we experience intense competition with respect to our animated feature films and software and risk factors we face various distribution risks with respect to our feature films 
pixar and disney jointly finance all production costs relating to the pictures on an equal basis 
pursuant to the terms of the co production agreement the parties established a mutually acceptable funding mechanism to ensure that sums would be available in a timely manner to fund production costs 
in practice  pixar prepares funding requests for forecasted film production costs and disney funds its share on a monthly basis at approximately the beginning of the month 
all payments to pixar from disney for development and production of toy story under the feature film agreement  and the pictures under the co production agreement have been recorded as cost reimbursements 
accordingly  no revenue has been recognized for such reimbursements  rather  we have netted the reimbursements against the related costs 
these reimbursed costs through the end of fiscal are set forth in note of notes to financial statements 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize film revenue from the distribution of all our animated feature films and related products when earned and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
the following are the conditions that must be met in order to recognize revenue in accordance with sop persuasive evidence of a sale or licensing arrangement with a customer exists  the film is complete and  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation  exhibition or sale  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
under the co production agreement  we share equally with disney in the profits of the incredibles  finding nemo  monsters  inc  toy story and a bug s life after disney recovers its marketing  distribution and other predefined costs and fees 
our revenues for toy story are governed by the terms of the feature film agreement under which disney fully financed the production costs and shares a specified percentage of toy story profits with pixar after certain agreed upon costs and fees are deducted 
we recognize revenue from our films net of distribution fees  reserves for returns  and marketing and distribution expenses 
disney provides us with gross receipt information  return reserve information  marketing and distribution costs and any other fees and expenses 
we utilize this information to determine our portion of the revenue by applying the contractual provisions included in our arrangements with disney 
we may also adjust certain of disney s estimates  such as home video returns and distribution expenses  based on pixar s historical experience and other industry information 
the amount of revenue recognized in any given quarter or quarters from all of our films depends on the timing  accuracy  and sufficiency of information we receive from disney to determine revenues and associated gross profits 
although disney provides us with the most current information available to enable us to recognize our share of revenue and determine our film gross profit  in the past we have made revisions  and we are likely to make revisions in the future  to that information based on our estimates and judgments 
such information includes theatrical bad debt reserves and expenses  home video return reserves and expenses  merchandise expenses  and estimates for both revenues and related expenses resulting from differences between disney s fiscal reporting period and ours 
for example  in the past  our theatrical revenues have been adjusted for our estimated reserves on potential uncollectible amounts to be received from theatrical exhibitors 
estimated reserves for uncollectible amounts are 
table of contents established based on a review of the industry  discussions with disney  and our historical experience 
to date we have not experienced significant losses  and therefore we have not had significant reserves for uncollectible receivables 
the total allowance against our revenue for theatrical exhibitor uncollectible amounts approximated million and million at january  and january   respectively 
we have also made adjustments to our home video revenues for estimates on return reserves that may differ from those reported by disney 
in determining our home video reserves for a particular title  we review information such as disney s current return reserves  the historical return reserves for our previous titles  actual rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel and other business and industry trend information that is available 
disney has provided and may continue to provide us with reserve information that may differ substantially from our historical experience with our previous titles 
unless disney provides a sufficient rationale as to why the market and sales performance are substantially different for a particular title  we have and may continue to record reserves more consistent with our historical experience 
our home video return reserves exceeded disney s estimates by million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the estimate for return reserves  whether based on historical information or more current information from disney  is inherently subjective and may differ significantly from actual results 
our original estimates on reserves may be revised in future periods as new and additional information becomes available 
see note of notes to financial statements for further discussion on reserves for returns 
we have utilized margin normalization  such as with merchandise or home video expenses  in accordance with the provisions of sop this may result in the utilization of budgeted or forecasted information to calculate an ultimate lifetime expense margin  rather than actual costs incurred if it is deemed to be a more accurate reflection of our participation 
similar to return reserves  these expense estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically to ensure that the most accurate depiction of our participation is reflected 
for example  during fiscal  we received updated information from disney that supported a reduction in the ultimate expense projections for finding nemo and monsters  inc as a result  we revised our estimate of domestic home video and merchandise expense  which increased our revenues by million for the year 
disney may also make subsequent adjustments to the information that it has provided  and these adjustments could have a significant impact on our operating results in later periods 
as updated information becomes available from disney  it may result in a change of estimation for revenue recognition 
for example  we received updated information from disney in the first quarter of  which decreased previously recorded home video expenses by million for all of our film titles on a cumulative basis 
during the second quarter of  we recognized an adjustment that reduced our monsters  inc domestic home video revenue after we received updated information from disney  which reflected higher returns of domestic home video than had been originally anticipated 
this adjustment reduced our home video revenues by million for the quarter 
we also received a settlement on monsters  inc merchandise revenue during the third quarter of  which resulted in an increase of million to our revenues 
any revisions to our estimated reserves  margin normalization or updated information from disney  as noted above  as well as findings from audit rights offered in accordance with the terms of the co production agreement  could have a material effect on our financial statements in any given quarter or quarters 
see note and note of notes to financial statements for additional discussion on such adjustments and revisions 
in accordance with the provisions of sop  a film is classified as a library title after three years from the film s initial release 
currently  toy story  a bug s life  toy story and monsters  inc are classified as library titles 
the term library title is used solely for the purpose of classification and for identifying previously released films in accordance with the provisions of sop revenue recognition for such titles is in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for film revenue 
software revenue revenue for software licenses is recognized in compliance with sop software revenue recognition as amended by sop modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  
table of contents delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of these fees is probable 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as support services  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
software maintenance is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is generally twelve months 
film production costs we capitalize our share of direct film production costs in accordance with sop film production costs include costs to develop and produce computer animated motion pictures  which primarily consist of salaries  equipment and overhead 
with regard to the pictures  we capitalize film production costs in excess of reimbursable amounts from disney 
for film projects outside of our existing disney relationship  we capitalize all film production costs 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of our films 
capitalized production overhead does not include administrative  general and research and development expenses 
once a film is released  capitalized film production costs will be amortized in the proportion that the revenue during the period for each film bears to the estimated revenue to be received from all sources under the individual film forecast computation method 
the amount of film costs that will be amortized each quarter will depend on how much future revenue we expect to receive from each film 
with respect to the pictures  we make certain estimates and judgments of our future gross revenues to be received for each film based on information received from disney and on our knowledge of the industry 
estimates of anticipated total gross revenues are reviewed periodically and may be revised if necessary 
a change to the estimate of gross revenues for an individual film may result in an increase or decrease to the percentage of amortization of capitalized film costs relative to a previous period 
unamortized film production costs are compared with net realizable value each reporting period on a film by film basis 
if estimated remaining gross revenues are not sufficient to recover the unamortized film production costs  the unamortized film production costs will be written down to fair value 
in the event a film is not set for production within three years from the time of the first capitalized transaction  all such costs will be expensed 
results of operations our revenues are derived primarily from our animated feature films and related products  and to a lesser extent  software licensing 
feature film revenue and related products represented  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
significant film revenue streams include worldwide theatrical  home video  television and consumer products 
home video sales  including vhs and dvd formats  continue to be among the largest contributors to lifetime revenues of our films 
the television market for our feature films generally follows the theatrical and home video release 
we intend to release all of our films on television  which includes pay per view  pay television and network television 
our results for the year ended january  were driven primarily by worldwide home video and consumer products revenue from finding nemo and the worldwide theatrical release of the incredibles 
by the end of fiscal  the incredibles had generated approximately million in worldwide box office receipts  comprised of million domestically and million internationally 
additionally  the films in our film library contributed approximately of our total revenues underscoring the long term value of these highly successful franchises 

table of contents revenue total revenue  which consists of film revenue and software revenue  amounted to million in  million in and million in film revenue was million in  million in  and million in film revenues for consisted of million from monsters  inc and million in revenues from our remaining library titles 
revenues for monsters  inc were derived from worldwide home video sales  foreign box office receipts  merchandise sales and ancillary royalties 
revenues from our other library titles resulted primarily from international television licensing  worldwide home video sales  merchandising sales and ancillary royalties 
during  we reduced our home video return reserves for a bug s life and toy story  which increased our revenues by million 
additionally  we adjusted our estimates on expense margins on home video and merchandise for toy story and a bug s life  which increased our revenues by million for the year 
disney also provided us with updated information on a bug s life and toy story home video and merchandise activities that increased our revenues by approximately million for the year 
film revenues for consisted of million from finding nemo  primarily attributable to domestic home video revenues and worldwide theatrical revenues 
monsters  inc contributed million  resulting primarily from domestic television licensing and merchandising revenues 
our remaining library titles contributed million for fiscal  resulting from merchandise sales  worldwide home video sales and foreign television licensing 
during  disney provided updated information reflecting higher home video return activity than had been originally anticipated which reduced revenues by million 
we also received a settlement on monsters  inc merchandise revenue  which resulted in an increase of million to our revenues 
additionally  we received updated information from disney relating to home video expenses  which decreased previously recorded home video expenses by million for all of our film titles on a cumulative basis 
the higher revenues in relative to were primarily due to the tremendous success of finding nemo in both worldwide theatrical and domestic home video markets 
in may  two of our library titles  toy story and toy story  were placed on a domestic home video sales moratorium 
internationally  these two titles were placed on moratorium at various dates beginning in the spring of film revenues for included million from finding nemo  primarily attributable to worldwide home video revenues and consumer products revenues 
the incredibles  which began its worldwide theatrical release in november  generated revenues of million during the year 
our library titles also generated revenues of million during the year including million from monsters  inc  primarily from home video sales and television licensing 
animation services revenues contributed million to total film revenues for the year 
during  revisions to reserve estimates that were established in prior years for monsters  inc international home video reserves and finding nemo domestic home video reserves resulted in approximately million and million in revenues  respectively 
see note of notes to financial statements for further discussion on reserves for returns 
additionally  we adjusted our estimates on expense margins for finding nemo and monsters  inc home video and merchandise  which increased our revenues by million for the year 
software revenue includes software license revenue  principally from renderman  and royalty revenue from licensing physical effects  inc pei technology to a third party 
software revenue was million in  million in  and million in pei  a company we acquired in  licensed certain of its technology to a third party  from which we now receive associated royalty revenue on a quarterly basis 
in spite of the increase in software revenue for  our primary focus is on content creation for animated feature films and related products  and as a result  we have not increased the time and resources necessary to generate significantly higher renderman license revenues 
therefore  we continue to expect ongoing variability in revenue derived from software licenses from year to year 
software maintenance contracts are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance agreement  which ranges from to months in duration 
for fiscal  and  disney accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
the revenue from disney consists primarily of film related revenues 
because of our relationship with disney under the co production agreement  disney is expected to represent significantly greater than of our revenues in and in the near future 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue was million in  million in  and million in  and represents primarily amortization of capitalized film costs 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary for any given period due to changes in the mix of film revenue as the gross profit varies by film  as well as for revisions to estimates on revenue to be received under the individual film forecast computation method 
a change to an individual film s estimate of revenue to be received may result in an increase or decrease to the amortization of the capitalized film costs relative to a previous period 
toy story revenue has no related cost  as film costs have been fully amortized 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of total film revenue from to can be attributable to a higher proportion of revenues resulting from finding nemo  which had a lower amortization percentage than monsters  inc in the prior year  since we expect to receive more revenues from finding nemo over its lifetime 
additionally  the cost amortization for the remaining library titles declined in relative to the decrease in cost of film revenue as a percentage of total film revenue for compared to can be attributable to favorable revisions on estimates of revenue to be received  primarily for finding nemo and monsters  inc due to the continued success of our films  the amortization costs for our films have decreased relative to their respective amortization percentages in the prior year due to increases in their ultimate revenue 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased from million in to million in to million in we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as a result of the growth of the studio as we ramp up to meet the needs of multiple films in production 
additionally  our proportion of operating expenses previously borne by disney has and will continue to increase as we near the end of the term of our co production agreement 
during fiscal  our operating expenses included approximately million of costs related to an employee bonus in recognition of their contribution to the box office success of finding nemo 
additionally  we wrote off million in costs previously capitalized for future film projects 
in reviewing our projects in development  we determined it unlikely that these projects would be green lit for production within the next three years  therefore  under sop  we expensed these amounts 
during fiscal  our operating expenses included approximately million of costs related to an employee bonus in recognition of their contribution to the box office success of the incredibles 
we anticipate operating expenses to continue to increase in future periods due to the growth experienced by the studio as we dedicate more resources to our productions not governed by the co production agreement 
under the co production agreement  disney reimburses us for half of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions of the pictures 
the funding received from disney is treated as operating expense reimbursements 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional discussion of disney s operating expense reimbursements 
to the extent that personnel  facilities and other expenditures are neither capitalized by us nor allocated to and paid for by disney  and precede or are not subsequently followed by an increase in revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
for example  in february  we approved our first feature film to be produced outside of the existing relationship with disney  and certain allocated costs that have been reimbursed by disney in our previous films will now be expensed as incurred 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and support for personnel conducting research and development for the renderman product  for our proprietary marionette and ringmaster animation and production management software and for creative development for future films 
research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in research and development costs for over was primarily attributable to the million write off of development projects and the higher employee related expenses associated with employee bonus referred to above  as well as additional staffing 
the increase in research and development costs for over was primarily attributable to increased creative development and short film projects  as well as a decrease in disney s reimbursement of allocated costs under the co production 
table of contents agreement 
this increase was partially offset by the write off of development projects in as described above 
to date  all research and development costs not reimbursed by disney have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead  as well as public relations  advertising  technical support and trade show costs required to support our software segment 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in expense in as compared to is primarily due to higher employee related costs resulting from the employee bonus discussed above and increased public relations and corporate marketing costs 
sales and marketing expenses remained relatively unchanged in compared to we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods  particularly in the areas of public relations and corporate marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of management and administrative personnel  insurance costs and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses have increased from million in to million in to million in the increase from to was primarily due to the incentive compensation referred to above and an increase in professional fees 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased professional fees and a decrease in disney s reimbursement of allocated costs under the co production agreement as mentioned above 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase in future periods 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net was million in  million in  and million in even though cash  cash equivalents and investments increased in  declining interest rates in caused interest income to remain flat when compared to the increase in compared to was the result of higher average cash and investment balances 
income taxes income tax expense of million  million  and million reflects our effective tax rates of   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
in and  our income tax rate approximated us federal and california state statutory rates 
in  our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the recognition of a federal tax benefit associated with certain income earned outside the us for fiscal years through we recorded the benefit for fiscal years through in as the availability of this tax benefit in prior years was uncertain and was therefore not factored into our tax rate until our effective tax rate for is expected to increase from our rate 
see note of notes to financial statements 
capitalized film production costs we had million in capitalized film production costs as of january   consisting of costs relating to toy story  a bug s life  monsters  inc  finding nemo  the incredibles and cars  all of which are being co financed by disney under the co production agreement 
capitalized film production costs also include costs related to our first pixar only financed film and films in development 
all toy story capitalized film costs have been fully amortized 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments increased from million at january  to million at january  the increase was primarily due to cash received from disney for our share of film revenue  as well as proceeds from stock option exercises  software revenue  and interest income 
this increase was partially offset by film production spending  tax payments  and capital expenditures 
in  net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to net income of million adjusted for the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of capitalized film production costs of million and 
table of contents an increase in unearned revenue of million partially offset by a net increase in our receivable from disney of million  an increase in capitalized film production costs of million  an increase in prepaid expenses of million  an increase of deferred income taxes of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in income taxes payable to million 
in  cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily attributable to net income of million adjusted for the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of capitalized film production costs totaling million  increases in income taxes payable of million  decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  increases in accrued liabilities of million  increases in unearned revenue of million  and a decrease in other receivables of million partially offset by a net increase in our receivable from disney of million  capitalized film production costs of million  deferred income taxes of million  the gain on sales of investments of million  and an increase in our trade accounts receivable of million

in fiscal  and  cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of the purchase of investments and the purchase of property and equipment  offset by net proceeds from sales of investments 
in fiscal  and  cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from exercised stock options 
as of january   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our future capital commitments primarily consist of obligations to fund production costs of films and derivative products under the co production agreement and beyond 
we will co finance the final original picture we have in production  cars  pursuant to the co production agreement 
in the future  we may co finance other derivative works such as theatrical sequels  direct to home video sequels  interactive products and television productions 
additionally  we have already approved for production our first film beyond the co production agreement and will finance those costs entirely 
we also have obligations to pay portions of any revenue derived from each feature film produced under the co production agreement to our entertainment law firm in consideration for services rendered 
film production costs 
in fiscal year  we expect to spend approximately million to million  net of disney s film cost reimbursements  on direct film costs and other costs to fund our ongoing film projects under the co production agreement as well as film projects beyond the co production agreement  which will directly impact working capital 
facility related capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  we expect to spend approximately million to million related to capital expenditures for our emeryville campus and other facility related projects 
we believe that our current available funds and forecasted cash from operations in fiscal will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  including the production costs of cars and the production and development costs associated with films beyond the co production agreement 
there can be no assurance that current and forecasted cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations 
to date  we have chosen to use our existing cash resources to fund both the construction on our emeryville campus and film production costs 
we may continue to use our cash resources for such expenditures  or may choose to finance such capital expenditures through issuance of additional equity or debt securities  by obtaining a credit facility or by some other financing mechanism 

table of contents contractual obligations 
at january   we had contractual commitments to make payments under operating leases 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total off balance sheet arrangements 
as of january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
the statement replaces sfas  supersedes apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r no later than our third quarter of fiscal year  which begins july  sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
while the fair value method under sfas r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas with regards to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our financial statements 
for example  sfas permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
sfas r will also require a classification change in the statement of cash flows  whereby  a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flows to financing cash flows total cash flows will remain unchanged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas as we are still in the process of evaluating the requirements under sfas r 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted in the final rules 
the cumulative effect of adoption  if any  applied on a modified prospective basis  would be measured and recognized on july  in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf requires that when the fair value of an investment security is less than its carrying value  an impairment exists for which the determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the eitf impairment model applies to all investment securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and to investment securities accounted for under the cost method to the extent an impairment indicator exists 
under the guidance  the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary and therefore would result in a recognized loss depends on market conditions and management s intent and ability to hold the securities with unrealized losses 
in september  the fasb approved fasb staff position fsp eitf which defers the effective date for recognition and measurement guidance contained in eitf until certain issues are resolved  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will adopt the recognition and measurement guidance at the time of final issuance 
we believe that the adoption of eitf will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents on december   the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas addresses the measurement of exchanges of non monetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges beginning in our third quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the ajca became law in the united states 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the ajca introduced a tax deduction of up to percent when fully phased in of the lesser of a qualified production activities income  as defined in the ajca  or b taxable income after the deduction for the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards 
fsp no 
fas clarifies that the qualified production activities deduction provided for under the ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement we believe that the adoption of fsp no 
fas will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

we recognize revenues from foreign territories based on an average foreign currency exchange rate used by disney for revenue reporting 
this rate may differ from the actual exchange rate at the time cash is remitted to disney and subsequently to us 
therefore  there may be some indirect foreign currency exchange rate exposure as managed by disney
