competition the banking business in california  and specifically in the market areas served by the bank s branch offices  is highly competitive 
the bank competes for deposits and loans with other commercial banks  savings and thrift institutions  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
in addition  the bank also competes with other entities both governmental and private industry that are seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities 
many of these institutions and entities offer services that are not offered directly by the bank and have substantially greater financial resources than does the bank 
the direction of federal legislation in recent years seems to favor increased competition between different types of financial institutions and to foster new entrants into the financial services market 
competitive conditions are expected to continue to intensify as legislation is enacted which will have the effect of eliminating historical barriers that limit participation in certain markets  increasing the cost of doing business for banks  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
technological factors  such as on line banking and brokerage services  and economic factors are also expected to increase competitive conditions 
to compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas  the bank relies principally upon the following local promotional activities  personal contacts by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders  extended hours on weekdays  saturday banking  and sunday banking in certain locations  internet banking  an internet website  located at www

investors can obtain information about the operation of the sec s public reference room by calling sec regulation and supervision general the bancorp and the bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is only a brief summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to 
no assurance can be given that these statutes and regulations will not change in the future 
holding company regulation the bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act and is registered as such with the federal reserve board 
a bank holding company is required to file with the federal reserve board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries 
it is also subject to examination by the federal reserve board and is required to obtain federal reserve board approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if it would thereby directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock 
in  the federal reserve board adopted a policy for risk focused supervision of small bank holding companies that do not engage in significant non banking activities 
under this policy  examinations focus on whether a bank holding company has systems in place to manage the risks inherent in its business 
in analyzing risk  the federal reserve board looks at the financial condition of the holding company and its subsidiary banks  management  compliance with laws and regulations  
table of contents inter company transactions and any new or contemplated activities 
the federal reserve board has by regulation determined certain activities in which a bank holding company may or may not engage 
with certain exceptions  a bank holding company may engage only in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks or activities that are closely related to banking activities 
in  the permissible activities and affiliations of certain bank holding companies was expanded 
see section below entitled financial modernization act 
a holding company for a bank and any subsidiary which it acquires or organizes are deemed to be affiliates of the bank within the meaning set forth in the federal reserve act and are subject to the federal reserve act 
this means  for example  that there are limitations on loans by the bank to affiliates  on investments by the bank in any affiliate s stock and on the bank s taking any affiliate s stock as collateral for loans to any borrower 
all affiliate transactions must satisfy certain limitations and otherwise be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
in this regard  banks generally may not purchase from any affiliate a low quality asset as that term is defined in the federal reserve act 
also  transactions by the bank with an affiliate must be on substantially the same terms as would be available for non affiliates 
the bancorp and the bank are currently subject to these restrictions 
the bancorp and the bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
they are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
for example  generally the bank may not extend credit on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the bank or its parent company  or refrain from obtaining such service from a competitor 
bank regulation federal law mandates frequent examinations of all banks  with the costs of examinations to be assessed against the bank 
the bank s primary federal regulator is the federal deposit insurance corporation  or the fdic 
the federal banking regulatory agencies have substantial enforcement powers over the depository institutions that they regulate 
civil and criminal penalties may be imposed on such institutions and persons associated with those institutions for violations of laws or regulation 
as a california state chartered bank whose accounts are insured by the fdic up to a maximum of  per depositor  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision  and regular examination by the california commissioner of financial institutions  or the california commissioner  and the fdic  and must comply with applicable regulations of the federal reserve board 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the bank s business  including the making of periodic reports  its activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  branching  mergers and acquisitions  reserves against deposits and numerous other areas 
supervision  legal action  and examination by these agencies is generally intended to protect depositors  creditors  borrowers and the deposit insurance fund and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders 
the activities of the bank are also regulated by state law 
state law  for example  regulates certain loans to officers of the bank  directly or indirectly  or to any related corporation in which such officer is a shareholder  director  officer or employee 
subject to certain limitations  california law permits california state chartered banks to invest in the stock and equity securities of other corporations  to engage directly in  or invest directly in subsidiaries which conduct  real estate related activities including property management and real estate appraisal  and to participate in management consulting and data processing services for third parties 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia  limits the powers  including investment authority  of state banks to those activities that are either permitted to national banks  or activities that the fdic finds do not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund 
in november  the fdic announced that it would make it easier for well run 
table of contents state banks to engage in real estate and securities underwriting  if permitted by state law 
state banks are now required to file notice of intention to engage in such activities 
fdicia places limits on brokered deposits and extends the limits to any bank that is not well capitalized or has been notified that it is in troubled condition 
a well capitalized institution which generally includes an institution that is considered well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below may still accept brokered deposits without restriction  unless it has been informed by its appropriate federal regulatory agency that it is in troubled condition 
all other insured depository institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits unless a waiver is obtained from the fdic 
if a waiver is obtained  the interest paid on deposits may not exceed the rate paid for deposits in the bank s normal market area  or the national rate as determined in the fdic s regulation 
capital adequacy requirements the bancorp is subject to the capital adequacy regulations of the federal reserve board  and the bank is subject to the capital adequacy regulations of fdicia 
those regulations incorporate both risk based and leverage capital requirements 
each of the federal regulators has established risk based and leverage capital guidelines for banks or bank holding companies it regulates  which set total capital requirements and define capital in terms of core capital elements  or tier capital  and supplemental capital elements  or tier capital 
tier capital is generally defined as the sum of the core capital elements less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair market value 
the following items are defined as core capital elements i common shareholders equity  ii qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and iii minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
trust preferred securities may also constitute up to of tier capital 
see further discussion of the final rule adopted by the federal reserve board on march  on the eligibility of trust preferred as tier capital at subsidiaries of bancorp 
supplementary capital elements include i allowance for loan and lease losses but not more than of an institution s risk weighted assets  ii perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital  iii hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments  and iv term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock and related surplus 
the maximum amount of supplemental capital elements which qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the minimum required ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets  or the total risk based capital ratio  is  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and the minimum required ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets  or the tier risk based capital ratio  is 
risk based capital ratios are calculated to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under the risk based capital guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   the bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
the risk based capital requirements also take into account concentrations of credit ie  relatively large proportions of loans involving one borrower  industry  location  collateral or loan type and the risks of non traditional activities those that have not customarily been part of the banking business 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards  and authorize the regulators to review an institution s management of such risks in assessing an institution s capital adequacy 

table of contents the risk based capital regulations also include exposure to interest rate risk as a factor that the regulators will consider in evaluating a bank s capital adequacy 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
while interest risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the institution 
the fdic and the federal reserve board also require the maintenance of a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans  and federal regulators may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  and the bancorp s leverage capital ratio was  both ratios exceeding regulatory minimums 
the federal regulatory authorities risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the bis 
the bis is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
in june  the bis published a new capital accord to replace its capital accord 
the new capital accord would  among other things  set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk 
operational risk is defined to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems in connection with external events 
the capital accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 
the united states federal regulatory authorities are currently expected to release proposed rules to implement the bis s new capital accord in mid year it is currently anticipated that these authorities would release final rules in mid year  and that the final rules would become effective in january the company cannot predict the timing or final form of the united states rules implementing the new capital accord and their impact on the bancorp or the bank 
the new capital requirements that may arise from the final rules could increase the minimum capital requirements applicable to the bancorp and its subsidiaries 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
in addition to these measures  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal 
table of contents regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  institutions such as the bank that are insured by the bank insurance fund are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
this risk based premium system results in premiums which range from the basis points subject to a  minimum annual fee for the most highly rated well capitalized bank basis points per of domestic deposits for troubled banks which are undercapitalized 
the bank currently pays the minimum assessment 
in addition  banks must pay a fluctuating amount towards the retirement of the financing corporation bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
the current fico assessment rate for institutions insured by the bank insurance fund is per of assessable deposit 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly and do not vary depending on an institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
dividends holders of the bancorp s common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor under the laws of the state of delaware 
delaware corporations such as the bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus  or out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year 
however  dividends may not be paid out of a corporation s net profits if  after the payment of the dividend  the corporation s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
the federal reserve board has advised bank holding companies that it believes that payment of cash dividends in excess of current earnings from operations is inappropriate and may be cause for supervisory action 
as a result of this policy  banks and their holding companies may find it difficult to pay dividends out of retained earnings from historical periods prior to the most recent fiscal year or to take advantage of earnings generated by extraordinary items such as sales of buildings or other large assets in order to generate profits to enable payment of future dividends 
further  the federal reserve board s position that holding companies are expected to provide a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks potentially restricts a bank holding company s ability to pay dividends 

table of contents the bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company 
the bancorp receives income through dividends paid by the bank 
subject to the regulatory restrictions described below  future cash dividends by the bank will depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the powers of the board of directors of the bank to declare a cash dividend to its holding company is subject to california law  which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of the retained earnings or the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders made during such period 
where the above test is not met  cash dividends may still be paid  with the prior approval of the california commissioner in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings of the bank  the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends to the bancorp immediately after december   is restricted to approximately million under this regulation 
under the federal deposit insurance act  bank regulators also have authority to prohibit a bank from engaging in business practices which are considered to be unsafe or unsound 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of a bank and other factors  that such regulators could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under certain circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice  even if technically permissible 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving community reinvestment act  or cra  activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to take into account a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on the bank s actual lending  service  and investment performance  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
in its most recently released public reports  from february  the bank received a satisfactory rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations examination and enforcement have become intense  and banks have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
in addition to the other laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is subject to certain consumer and public interest laws and regulations that are designed to protect customers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth below is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the fair credit reporting act  the fair debt collection practices act and the right to financial privacy act 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in 
table of contents which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans and providing other services 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject it to various penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the americans with disabilities act  in conjunction with similar california legislation  has increased the cost of doing business for banks 
the legislation requires employers with or more employees and all businesses operating commercial facilities or public accommodations to accommodate disabled employees and customers

interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  or the interstate banking act  regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be completed by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which that bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in  california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by the interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 

table of contents financial modernization act the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act became effective march  it repealed two provisions of the glass steagall act section  which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and section  which restricted officer  director  or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  it also contains provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of the law is to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bank holding company act framework to permit a holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance  and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
generally  the financial modernization act repeals historical restrictions on  and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to  affiliations among banks  securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  provides a uniform framework for the functional regulation of the activities of banks  savings institutions  and their holding companies  broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks  banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  and their financial subsidiaries  provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information  adopts a number of provisions related to the capitalization  membership  corporate governance  and other measures designed to modernize the federal home loan bank system  modifies the laws governing the implementation of the cra  and addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of financial institutions 
in order for the bancorp to take advantage of the ability to affiliate with other financial services providers  it must become a financial holding company as permitted under an amendment to the bank holding company act effected by the financial modernization act 
the bancorp currently meets the requirements to make an election to become a financial holding company  but its management has not made a determination for it to become a financial holding company 
the financial modernization act required that designated federal regulatory agencies  including the fdic  the federal reserve board  the comptroller of the currency and the securities and exchange commission  publish regulations to implement certain provisions of the act 
these agencies have cooperated in the release of rules that establish minimum requirements to be followed by financial institutions for protecting the privacy of financial information provided by consumers 
the agencies rules  which establish privacy standards to be followed by state banks such as the bank  requires a financial institution to i provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices  ii describe the conditions under which the institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties  and iii provide a method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties by opting out of that disclosure 
the financial modernization act also includes a new section of the federal deposit insurance act governing subsidiaries of state banks that engage in activities as principal that would only be permissible for a 
table of contents national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary 
it expressly preserves the ability of a state bank to retain all existing subsidiaries 
because california permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks  the bank is permitted to form subsidiaries to engage in the activities authorized by the financial modernization act to the same extent as a national bank 
in order to form a financial subsidiary  a bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management  and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks 
the bancorp does not believe that the financial modernization act has had a material adverse effect on the bancorp s operations 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the bancorp and the bank face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources 
regulation w on december   the federal reserve adopted regulation w  the rule that comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act

the statute and rule impose quantitative and qualitative limits on the ability of a bank to extend credit to  or engage in certain other transactions with  an affiliate and a nonaffiliate if an affiliate benefits from the transaction 
however  certain transactions that generally do not expose a bank to undue risk or abuse the safety net are exempted from coverage under regulation w

among other requirements  the bsa requires financial institutions to report imports and exports of currency in the amount of  or more and  in general  all cash transactions of  or more 
the bank has established a bsa compliance policy under which  among other precautions  the bank keeps currency transaction reports to document cash transactions in excess of  or in multiples totaling more than  during one business day  monitors certain potentially suspicious transactions such as the exchange of a large number of small denomination bills for large denomination bills  and scrutinizes electronic funds transfers for bsa compliance 
following a regular examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  the bank s board of directors  on june   approved and signed a memorandum of understanding mou with the fdic in connection with certain deficiencies identified by the fdic relating to the bank s compliance with certain provisions of the bsa 
under the terms of the mou  the bank must comply in all material respects with the bsa within days from the mou s effective date  july  the mou requires in part that the bank perform an analysis of its bsa risk profile and implement a written action plan designed to ensure compliance with the bsa 
such plan will include revisions of the bank s policies and procedures  enhancements of the bank s internal controls for bsa compliance  independent compliance testing  dedicated compliance staff  and regular employee training 
management believes that the bank is currently in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the mou 
however  the fdic has not yet examined the bank for compliance with the mou 
the mou is expected to result in additional bsa compliance expenses for the bank  although these expenses are not anticipated to have a material financial effect on the bancorp or the bank 
it may also have the 
table of contents effect of limiting or delaying the bank s and the bancorp s ability to obtain regulatory approval for certain expansionary activities

impact of monetary policies the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the federal reserve banks 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted

table of contents actual results in any future period may also vary from the past results discussed in this report 
given these risks and uncertainties  we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak as of the date hereof 
we have no intention and undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision of any forward looking statement to reflect future developments or events 
the financial information presented herein includes the accounts of the company  its subsidiaries  including the bank  and the bank s consolidated subsidiaries 
all material transactions between these entities are eliminated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounting for the allowance for loan losses the determination of the amount of the provision for loan losses charged to operations reflects management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the bank s control  including the performance of the bank s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
the total allowance for loan losses consists of two components specific allowances and general allowances 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration methodology and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 

table of contents with these above methodologies  the specific allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
allowances for other risks of probable loan losses have been included in the allowance for loan losses 
the components of the other risks that have a potential of affecting the bank s portfolio are comprised of three basic elements 
first  the bank has set aside funds to cover the risk factors of a continued slow recovery from the last recession 
the second component of other portfolio risk is the potential errors in loan classification and review methodologies 
the third component of other portfolio risk is the uncertainty associated with the airplane leveraged lease with continental airlines 
accounting for the merger with gbc bancorp accounting for the merger with gbc bancorp involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which has a material impact on the carrying value of fixed rate loans and borrowings and the determination of the core deposit intangible asset and goodwill

investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities  they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated comprehensive other income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income loss 
aside from the fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock that was determined to be impaired and written down during the fourth quarter of  we did not have any other investment securities that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes  and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable  since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements 
such loans are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
our non performing assets decreased million or to million at year end compared to million at year end the decrease in non performing assets was primarily due to increase in collections of non accrual loans during as a percentage of gross loans plus other real estate owned  our non performing assets decreased to at year end from at year end the non performing loan coverage ratio  defined as the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans  increased to at year end  from at year end the following table presents the breakdown of total non accrual  past due  and restructured loans for the past five years non accrual  past due and restructured loans december  dollars in thousands accruing loans past due days or more non accrual loans total non performing loans real estate acquired in foreclosure total non performing assets troubled debt restructurings non performing assets as a percentage of gross loans and other real estate owned at year end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans troubled debt restructurings accrue interest at their restructured terms

table of contents troubled debt restructurings a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan when the lender  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower 
the concessions may be granted in various forms  including reduction in the stated interest rate  reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest  and extension of the maturity date 
troubled debt restructurings  excluding those on non accrual status  decreased million to million at december   compared to million at december  at december   those restructured loans were performing under their revised terms 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current circumstances and events 
the assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on non accrual  or the loan has been restructured 
those loans less than our defined selection criteria are treated as a homogeneous portfolio 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
we identified impaired loans with a recorded investment of million at year end  compared to million at year end the average balance of impaired loans was million in and million in interest collected on impaired loans totaled million in and million in the following tables present a breakdown of impaired loans and the related allowances as of the dates indicated at december  at december  recorded investment allowance net balance recorded investment allowance net balance in thousands commercial real estate other total real estate includes commercial mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and residential mortgage loans and equity lines 
loan concentration we experienced no loan concentrations to multiple borrowers in similar activities that exceeded of total loans as of december  see factors that may affect future results below for a discussion of some of the factors that may affect the matters discussed in this section 
allowance for loan losses the bank s management is committed to managing the risk in its loan portfolio by maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered to be equal to the estimated and known risks in the loan 
table of contents portfolio 
with a risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses in a timely manner 
in addition  our board of directors has established a written loan policy that includes an effective loan review and control system to ensure that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and judges that it is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the bank s control  including the performance of the bank s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
see factors that may affect future results  in this annual report on form k  for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance 

table of contents the following table sets forth the information relating to the allowance for loan losses  charge offs  and recoveries for the past five years allowance for loan losses amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses charged offs commercial loans real estate loans installment loans and other loans total charged off recoveries commercial loans real estate loans installment loans and other loans total recoveries allowance from general bank at merger date balance at end of year average loans outstanding during year ended ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the year n a provision for loan losses to average loans outstanding during the year allowance to non performing loans at year end allowance to gross loans at year end our allowance for loan losses consists of the following specific allowance for impaired loans  we provide specific allowances based on an evaluation of impairment  and for each criticized loan  we allocate a portion of the general allowance to each loan based on a loss percentage assigned 
the percentage assigned depends on a number of factors including loan classification  the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio  and general economic conditions 
general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and by identifying risk characteristics that are common to the groups of loans 
the allowance is provided to each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience  the trends in delinquency  and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as national and local economy  trends and conditions  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and the concentration of credit 

table of contents the total allowance for loan losses consists of the above two components specific and general 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration methodology and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these above methodologies  the specific allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the table set forth below reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to the total loans as of the dates indicated allocation of allowance for loan losses as of december  amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans dollars in thousands type of loans commercial loans residential mortgage loans and equity lines commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans n a total the decrease in the allowance allocated to commercial loans resulted from the reduction in the level of non accrual and problem loans during commercial loans comprised of impaired loans  of non accrual loans and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  commercial loans also comprised of impaired loans  of non accrual loans  and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  the increase in the allowance allocated to residential mortgage loans and equity lines from million at december  to million at december   resulted from the higher balances for this loan category 
the increase in the allowance allocated to commercial real estate mortgages from million at december   to million at december   resulted from the higher balances for this loan category 
loan losses have been nominal during the past five years in this category 
the overall allowance was of total commercial real estate mortgages at both december   and december  
table of contents the allocated allowance for construction loans has decreased from million or of december   construction loans to million or of december   construction loans primarily as the result of the significant decrease in problem construction loans 
at december   a number of condominium construction loans in the state of washington were experiencing slower than expected sales and a substantial portion of the million allocated reserve at december  was related to these loans 
during  gross charge offs of construction loans totaled million 
the remaining washington state condominium construction loans experiencing slower than expected sales during either paid off or were sold by the bank during at december   million of construction loans were on non accrual status and no construction loan was past due days and still accruing interest 
allowances for other risks of probable loan losses that amounted to million as of december   compared to million as of december   have been included in the allocations above 
the components of the other risks that have a potential of affecting the bank s portfolio are comprised of three basic elements 
first  the bank has set aside funds to cover the risk factors of a continued slow recovery from the last recession 
the second component of other portfolio risk is the potential errors in loan classification and review methodologies 
the third component of other portfolio risk is the uncertainty associated with the airplane leveraged lease with continental airlines  which had a book value at december  of million and was still performing in accordance with its contractual terms 
based on these three above components of other risks  management has determined that the million allowance for other risks of probable loan losses at december   was appropriate

liquidity liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace 
our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments  repayments from securities and loans  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and advances from the fhlb 
at year end  our liquidity ratio defined as net cash  short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities decreased to  compared to at year end to supplement its liquidity needs  the bank maintains a total credit line of million for federal funds with three correspondent banks  and master agreements with four brokerage firms whereby up to million would be available through the sale of securities subject to repurchase 
the bank is also a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had an approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling million 
the total credit outstanding with the fhlb of san francisco at december   was million 
these advances are non callable and bear fixed interest rates and all mature during these borrowings are secured by securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and securities available for sale 
at december   such assets at fair value totaled billion  with billion pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments 
the remaining billion was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
we had a significant portion of our time deposits maturing within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months to the bank to meet its operating needs 

table of contents the bancorp obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the bank and proceeds from the issuance of the bancorp common stock by means of the dividend reinvestment plan and exercise of stock options 
dividends paid to the bancorp by the bank are subject to regulatory limitations 
the business activities of the bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank with limited activities in other investments 
management believes the bancorp s liquidity generated from its prevailing sources is sufficient to meet its operational needs

factors that may affect future results if we are unable to realize the benefits of the merger with gbc bancorp  the business and earnings of the company may be negatively affected 
while the merger with gbc bancorp was completed in october and most of our integration efforts were completed in  there is a risk that we may not be able to realize the full benefits of the merger with gbc bancorp without encountering difficulties  including the loss of key employees and customers  the disruption of our ongoing businesses and possible inconsistencies in corporate standards  controls  procedures and policies 
we might not achieve the economic benefits and cost savings we expect to result from the merger  and this would likely hurt our business and financial results 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of estimable and probable loan losses 
actual loan losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our net income and capital 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the estimable and probable losses from our loan portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our net income and capital 
such excess could also lead to larger allowances for loan losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect net income and capital in those periods 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to cover estimable and probable losses from its loan portfolio as of that date 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our loans  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses 
fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 

table of contents generally  the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the company do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of repricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
see also the sections entitled risks elements of the loan portfolio under item and market risk under item a of the annual report on the form k 
inflation and deflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation or deflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
conversely  deflation will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation or deflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business  if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in california tax law and changes in its interpretation relating to registered investment companies and real estate investment trusts 
our effective income tax rate was lower in and than in and due in large part to income tax benefits derived from a registered investment company subsidiary of the bank 
we had relied on the california tax law related to registered investment companies and on an outside tax opinion in creating this subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  a change in that law was enacted by the california legislature  which 
table of contents would deny such tax benefits from and after january  on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its position that certain tax deductions related to regulated investment companies as well as real estate investment trusts prior to january  would also be disallowed 
in december   we decided to deregister the registered investment company and  in february   we completed such deregistration 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed the net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of relating to the real estate investment trust reit that it formed as a subsidiary of the bank during the company did not record any tax benefits relating to the reit in the fourth quarter of and did not record any such benefits in as mentioned above  on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its intent to list certain transactions that in its view constitute potentially abusive tax shelters 
included in the transactions subject to this listing were transactions utilizing regulated investment companies rics and real estate investment trusts reits 
as part of the notification indicating the listed transactions  the ftb also indicated its position that it intends to disallow tax benefits associated with these transactions 
while the company continues to believe that the tax benefits recorded in three prior years with respect to its regulated investment company were appropriate and fully defensible under california law  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in voluntary compliance initiative option  requiring payment of all california taxes and interest on these disputed through tax benefits  and permitting the company to claim a refund for these years while avoiding certain potential penalties 
the company retains potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position in addition to the risk of not being successful in its refund claims 
as of december   the company reflected a million net state tax receivable for the years   and after giving effect to reserves for loss contingencies on the refund claims  or an equivalent of million after giving effect to federal tax benefits 
the ftb is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through although the company believes its tax deductions related to the regulated investment company were appropriate and fully defensible  there can be no assurance of the outcome of its refund claims  and an adverse outcome on the refund claims could result in a loss of all or a portion of the million net state tax receivable after giving effect to federal tax benefits 
adverse economic conditions in california and other regions where the bank has operations could cause us to incur losses 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in southern and northern california  and secondarily in new york  texas  massachusetts  and washington 
adverse economic conditions in these regions  such as the current california budget deficit and its impact could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral 
these events could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us 
real estate securing our lending activities is also principally located in southern and northern california  and to a lesser extent  in new york  texas  massachusetts  and washington 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  acts of nature including earthquakes  flood and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the risks inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
as a result of the merger with gbc bancorp  the company has a higher proportion of real estate construction loans than it did before the merger 
the risks inherent in construction lending may adversely affect 
table of contents our net income 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because such properties have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction  and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
such consideration can affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not insure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan on or secured by real property  we generally require an appraisal of such property 
however  the appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
we face substantial competition from larger competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits and loans  as well as other banking services  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
such banks and financial institutions have greater resources than us  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than us and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  brokerage houses  credit unions and non financial institutions 
adverse effects of banking regulations or changes in banking regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are regulated by significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers or which serve other public policies and not for the benefit of our stockholders 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by such regulation and supervision 
this trend is likely to continue in the future 
laws  regulations  or policies currently affecting us may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of existing laws and regulations 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on commercial banking in general or on our business in particular 
adverse economic conditions in asia could adversely affect our business 
it is difficult to predict the behavior of the asian economy 
us economic policies  military tensions  and an unfavorable global economic condition may adversely impact the asian economy 
if the asian economic conditions deteriorate  we could be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and could experience an outflow of deposits by our asian american customers 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of companies operating in this region 

table of contents statutory restrictions on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us 
a substantial portion of the bancorp s cash flow comes from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay without regulatory approval 
in addition  if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before we  as a holder of an equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank 
our need to continue to adapt to our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded services could present operational issues and require significant capital spending 
as we continue to offer internet banking and other on line services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry and regulatory standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend  among other things  on our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology  and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
systems failures  delays  breaches of confidentiality and other problems could harm our reputation and business 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement between us and american stock transfer and trust company  as rights agent  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  preferred share purchase rights that generally become exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
terrorist attacks could adversely affect us 
any terrorist attacks and responses to such activities could adversely affect the company in a number of ways  including  among others  an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
failure to comply with the bank s memorandum of understanding with the fdic could adversely affect our business 
on june   the bank s board of directors entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in connection with certain deficiencies identified by the fdic relating to the bank s compliance with certain provisions of the bank secrecy act 
under the terms of the mou  the bank must comply in all material respects with the bsa within days from the mou s effective date  july  if we fail to comply with the terms of the mou  the fdic could assess civil money penalties upon us  place restrictions on the source of our deposits  or in certain circumstances  appoint a conservator or receiver to oversee our operations 

table of contents in addition  if we violate the mou  the fdic may initiate a termination of insurance proceeding against us 
if any of these penalties or actions were to occur  they could materially and adversely affect our business and operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not reprice at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the repricing characteristics of our loans  securities  and deposits on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability as well as to estimate changes to the market value of our assets and liabilities 
we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the company s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is very helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rates changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies  among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 

table of contents the company s simulation model also projects the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would decrease by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our assets and liabilities would decrease by quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows the carrying value of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  as well as the instruments total fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities which are described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

table of contents financial derivatives it is the policy of the company not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
however  the company enters into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  the company may protect its position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 
the company follows sfas no 
which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings  together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged 
if there is not a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged  then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution in the notional amount of million for a period of five years 
the interest rate swap was for the purpose of hedging the cash flows from a portion of our floating rate loans against declining interest rates 
the purpose of the hedge is to provide a measure of stability in the future cash receipts from such loans over the term of the swap agreement  which at december   was approximately three months 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million  exclusive of accrued interest  or million net of tax  compared to million  exclusive of accrued interest  or million net of tax  at december  for the twelve months ended december   net amounts totaling million were reclassified into earnings 
the estimated net amount of the existing gains within accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to reclassify into earnings within the next months is approximately million 
in  the bank entered into million of interest rate swaps that will terminate in and can be terminated after two years at the election of the counterparty swaptions to mitigate risks associated with changes to the fair value of a like amount of fixed rate certificates of deposit five year cds that have similar call features 
for the first two years of the swaps  the bank will receive interest at a weighted average fixed rate of and will pay interest at a rate of libor less basis points 
if the swaps are not terminated in  then the bank will receive interest at a weighted average rate of and pay interest at a rate of libor less basis points for the last three years of the swap term 
all of these interest rate hedges were initially designated as fair value hedges against a like amount of five year cds and the bank expected a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the five year cds 
however  at december   there was a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the five year cds for only one group of five year cds with a principal amount of million and an unrealized gain of million 
the unrealized loss on the interest rate swaps and the unrealized gain on the million of five year cds have been recorded in income 
table of contents for the unrealized loss on the ineffective interest rates swaps at december   of  has been recorded in income for and the related unrealized gain on the five year cds with ineffective hedges was reversed from income as of december  for the year ended december   interest expense on certificates of deposit was reduced by million as a result of these interest rate swaps 
in  the bank entered into million of interest rate swaps that will terminate in and can be terminated after one year at the election of the counterparty to mitigate risks associated with changes to the fair value of a like amount of fixed rate certificates of deposit three year cds that have similar call features 
for the first year of the swaps  the bank will receive interest at a weighted average fixed rate of and will pay interest at a rate of libor less basis points 
if the swaps are not terminated in  then the bank will receive interest at a weighted average rate of and pay interest at a rate of libor less basis points for the last two years of the swap term 
all of these interest rate hedges were initially designated as fair value hedges against a like amount of three year cds and the bank expected a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the three year cds 
however  at december   the fair value of these interest rate swaps  which did not have a highly effective correlation with changes in the fair value of the three year cds  was an unrealized loss of  which was recorded in income for for the year ended december   interest expense on certificates of deposit was reduced by million as a result of these interest rate swaps
