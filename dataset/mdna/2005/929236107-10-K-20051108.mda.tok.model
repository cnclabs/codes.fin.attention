changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior fiscal year contributed to the growth of our sales as well as growth in expenses 
fiscal year results translated at last fiscal year s exchange rates would have produced sales of million  and net income of million 
the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates year over year positively affected sales in fiscal year by million and net income by million 
the us household products business showed mixed results in fiscal year the company experienced sales declines with spot shot and carpet fresh 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales of x hard surface cleaners and flushes 
the increase in x hard surface cleaners was due to new product introductions that were not available in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in flushes was due to the increased sales of the new clip on product  which was introduced during last fiscal year s second quarter 
we continue to be focused and committed to innovation 
in the us  new product introductions continued throughout fiscal year direct results of this commitment were the launches of x oxy citrus  the in one pro dry lube  spot shot pro  spot shot trigger  the wd smart straw and the wd no mess pen 
spot shot pro is targeted to frequent and commercial users and provides innovation through its odor neutralizing formula  while spot shot trigger is a liquid carpet stain remover with a trigger delivery format 
the wd smart straw features a permanently attached straw  which allows for precision stream or regular spray action 
the wd no mess pen provides innovation through its pen shaped applicator  which allows for precise application 
fiscal year also saw the launch of new products into the european and australian markets 
in australia  the in one professional degreaser  the in one pro quickstart  the solvol citrus bar and the solvol citrus liquid soap were launched 
the degreaser and quickstart are marketed into various trade channels including automotive  hardware and industrial  while the citrus bar and liquid soap are grocery based products  although they have the potential to gain distribution in additional markets 
in europe  a laminate floor cleaner was added to the household product line  while the launch of items in the in one pro line continued 
we are pleased with our recent introductions of innovative products  and we continue to be encouraged by the company s accelerated pace of innovation  including potential new products currently in development 
we see innovation as an important factor to the success of our brands  and we intend to continue our commitment to work on future product  packaging and promotional innovations 
the rising costs of products sold negatively affected gross margins during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we continue to be concerned about rising costs of components and raw materials  particularly aerosol cans and petroleum based products 
we began to incur increased costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and have continued to see further cost increases 
we are also concerned about the possibility of further increases into fiscal year to combat these cost increases  the company implemented price increases on certain products during the third quarter of fiscal year in addition  we have been focused on cost saving initiatives throughout the supply chain 
the line of products in the uk  acquired during the third quarter of fiscal year  gave us a presence in the carpet and household cleaner market in the u 
k that enabled us to introduce the spot shot and carpet fresh no vac brands under the brand name 
these products are gaining distribution within the uk marketplace and contributed of the total sales from the line in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were up for the fiscal year ended august  versus the prior fiscal year primarily due to sales growth  increased freight costs  along with increased foreign currency exchange rates  increased research and development costs  increased employee related costs and an expense related to a customer bankruptcy 
investment in advertising and promotional activity was down in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to reduced consumer broadcast spending and print media in the us  partially offset by increased tv advertising in europe 
advertising and sales promotion expenses were of net sales in fiscal year this was reflective of the reduced effectiveness of traditional marketing programs 
weighted average shares outstanding  including the effects of dilution  have decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  due to purchases of treasury stock in accordance with the share buy back plan during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year results of operations year ended august  compared with the year ended august  net sales net sales by segment in thousands fiscal year ended august  change change americas europe asia pacific total net sales please refer to the discussion under segment results included later in this section for further detailed results by segment 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior fiscal year contributed to the growth of the company s sales

the increase in cost of products negatively affected gross margins in all of the company s regions 
this increase was primarily due to the significant rise in costs for components and raw materials  including aerosol cans and petroleum based products 
as a result of the general upward trend of costs in the market  we are concerned about the possibility of continued rising costs of components  raw materials and finished goods 
to reduce the impact of these rising costs  the company implemented a plan to increase prices for some of its products  the majority of such price increases were implemented in the third quarter of this fiscal year 
the increase in pricing of certain products worldwide added approximately to gross margin percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the price increases are intended to reduce the effect of rising costs on gross margin percentage  however  further rises in the cost of products could offset the benefits of the price increases 
the company is also examining supply chain cost savings initiatives in an effort to further reduce the impact of increased costs on gross margin percentage 
in addition  shifts in product mix as well as the timing of certain promotional activities could also cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period 
note that the company s gross margins may not be comparable to those of other reporting entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers from our contract packagers  and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal year increased to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a was attributable to a number of items including million related to increased foreign currency exchange rates  million of increased freight due to fuel surcharges  a change in customer purchase patterns which increased the frequency of shipments  but in smaller quantities  and sales growth  million of increased employee related costs which include salaries  profit sharing and other fringe benefits  million of increased miscellaneous expenses such as travel  office expenses and amortization and depreciation  million of increased research and development costs related to increased new product development activity  million of increased expenses primarily due to a preference claim associated with the bankruptcy of a customer  and million of increased professional services 
costs incurred for sarbanes oxley compliance have also continued to rise over the high costs incurred during the prior fiscal year in areas such as employee related costs  miscellaneous expenses and professional services 
these increases were partially offset by million of decreased sales commissions  insurance costs  investor relations costs and meeting and other expenses 
the company continued its research and development investment in support of its focus on innovation 
research and development costs in fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year the company s new product development team  known as team tomorrow  engages in consumer research  product development  current product improvement and testing activities 
this team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including the company s current and prospective outsource suppliers 
as a percentage of sales  sg a was in fiscal year and in fiscal year advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased to million in fiscal year  down from million in fiscal year  and as a percentage of sales  decreased to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is mainly related to reduced spending for print media and television media in the us  partially offset by increased television media spending in europe 
advertising spending in the us was reduced after the first quarter of the current fiscal year due to declines in consumer response to certain traditional advertising programs 
throughout the remainder of fiscal year  the company performed testing of new marketing programs and reevaluated the market dynamics and its strategies to determine which programs will be the most effective 
in fiscal year  the company expects to invest more in advertising and sales promotion expenses to support sales growth and new products 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company  as the costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  and others remain in advertising and sales promotion expenses 
in fiscal year  the total promotional costs recorded as reductions to sales were million versus million in fiscal year therefore  the company s total advertising and sales promotion expenses totaled million in fiscal year versus million in fiscal year amortization of intangible assets expense amortization of intangible assets expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the amortization relates to the non contractual customer relationships intangible asset acquired in the acquisition  which was completed in april this intangible asset is being amortized over its eight year life 
income from operations income from operations was million  or of sales in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales in fiscal year the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of sales was due to the items discussed above 
interest expense  net interest expense  net was million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the change in interest expense  net was primarily due to reduced principal balance on long term borrowings resulting from two million principal payments  which were made in may and  respectively 
interest income related to refunds from amended federal tax returns also contributed to the reduction in interest expense  net 
other income expense  net other income  net was million in fiscal  compared to other expense  net of million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of million  which was due to increased foreign currency exchange gains 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of taxable income in fiscal  an increase from in fiscal year the increase in tax rate was due to the impact of reduced low income housing credits  the growth of worldwide income and the reduction of extraterritorial income eti benefits 
net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal year ended august   compared to million  or per common share for the prior fiscal year

price increases implemented during the fiscal year third quarter on certain products also contributed to the sales growth 
in the us  wd sales were up due to improved display and distribution through home centers  the success of the wd big blast and the launch of the wd smart straw and the wd no mess pen 
the wd big blast was introduced in the second quarter of fiscal  and the wd smart straw and the wd no mess pen were introduced in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  respectively 
growth in latin america was primarily due to strong results in mexico  puerto rico  the caribbean and central america  associated with increased promotional activity and new distribution 
the latin america region also benefited from a more stable political and economic environment versus previous years 
canadian sales benefited from strong sales in all trade channels  as well as strong promotional execution during the current fiscal year  partially offset by decreased sales as a result of reduced promotional activities by a key customer 
the increases in wd sales were partially offset by a decline in in one sales in the us as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decline was also a result of reduced promotional activities by a key home center customer 
household product sales in fiscal year were down by million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year due to declines in the us sales in the us decreased by million  or  due to decreased sales of spot shot and carpet fresh 
these declines are the result of several factors  including competitor activity  changes to customer specific programs  lost or decreased distribution compared to the prior fiscal year and the effects of other competitive factors within and among their product categories that are further described below 
the company s household brands continue to experience significant competition within their categories and in related categories 
spot shot sales declined in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to heightened competitive activity and customer sales testing  partially offset by sales from new products  spot shot pro and spot shot trigger  during the current fiscal year fourth quarter 
during fiscal year  certain customers continued to perform on going head to head sales testing versus competitor products 
although spot shot was successful versus the competitor products and has maintained distribution  this sales testing process caused sales to be lower than the prior fiscal year 
overall  spot shot continues to outperform new entrants as well as established products on the shelf 
the company has committed research and development resources to create meaningful innovation for the spot shot brand  including spot shot pro and spot shot trigger 
spot shot pro is targeted to frequent and commercial users and provides innovation through its odor neutralizing formula 
spot shot trigger is a liquid carpet stain remover with a trigger delivery format 
within the past two years  retailers have reduced shelf space for traditional rug and room deodorizers for reallocation to other air care products 
as a result  the rug and room deodorizer category as a whole has declined in the mass retail and grocery trade channels 
sales of carpet fresh in the us declined million  or  due to lost distribution with a key customer  competitive activity within and around the category and the effects from reallocation of shelf space 
in an effort to offset some of these losses  the company has responded with a more competitive product offer in size and value 
new powder fragrance introductions have also helped grow powder sales versus the prior fiscal year 
despite these general trends in the rug and room deodorizer and air care categories  the carpet fresh brand has gained market share within the rug and room deodorizer category in the grocery trade channel 
in addition  the company recently expanded distribution through new channels  which resulted in sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company continues to refine its marketing  promotions and pricing strategies  and has committed research and development resources to create innovation for the carpet fresh brand 
despite the significant competition within the household brands category  the company was still able to achieve sales growth for two of its brands 
us sales of flushes x automatic toilet bowl cleaners were up in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to the sales of the flushes clip on product which was introduced during the second quarter of fiscal year sales of the automatic toilet bowl cleaning category are being pressured overall due to competition from the manual bowl cleaning category 
the clip on product continues to maintain distribution  although that category has declined due to a reduction in consumer marketing support by manufacturers and competition from the manual bowl cleaning category 
us sales of the x hard surface cleaners increased in fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year due primarily to the introduction of two new innovative products and the re launch and repositioning of the x mildew stain remover 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and first quarter of fiscal year  the company introduced two new products  x orange aerosol and x oxy citrus 
the x orange aerosol is differentiated by its highly effective formulation and wide area spray delivery system  while x oxy citrus utilizes a unique dual cleaning formula 
also contributing to the increase in sales was the company s repositioning of the x mildew stain remover product to respond to the competition by introducing a larger size and a long lasting mildew prevention claim 
this repositioning  which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  highlights a proven claim that x produces more effective results compared to the leading products in the category 
to address the challenges and opportunities that exist within the competitive environments of the household products categories  the company continues to focus on product  packaging and promotional innovation

the carpet fresh no vac formula is one of the first aerosol rug and room deodorizers in the uk market 
for the fiscal year ended august   carpet fresh no vac and spot shot contributed to the overall sales 
however  wd sales in the uk market were down versus the prior fiscal year primarily due to reduced promotional activity with a key customer 
the sales growth in spain for fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year was largely due to in one pro  which was launched during the first quarter of the current fiscal year 
in local currency  sales in france were flat 
wd sales were down due to a change in the purchasing patterns of a key customer 
this decline was offset by the continued launch of in one pro during the fiscal year 
the sales growth in italy was the result of increased awareness and penetration of the wd brand  as well as the benefit of additional sales staff as compared to the prior fiscal year

sales in asia were down in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to decreased wd sales resulting from slower sales caused by increased prices in primary markets including china  taiwan and malaysia 
the decrease in lubricant sales was slightly offset by the growth of no vac 
distribution of no vac rug and room deodorizers has grown in several countries with the introduction of local language variants  particularly in hong kong and malaysia through the automotive trade channel 
sales in australia were up primarily due to increased sales of no vac rug and room deodorizers  as distribution and market share continues to grow

lubricant sales benefited from promotions with a large home center retailer

preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management uses historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones management considers critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
the company s financial results may have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to the customer when risk of loss and title pass 
management must make judgments and certain assumptions in the determination of when delivery occurs 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  the company determines an average time of transit that is used to estimate the time of delivery 
differences in judgments or estimates  such as the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used  could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods returns  trade promotions  coupons and cash discounts 
accounting for sales incentives the company records sales incentives as a reduction of sales in its income statement 
the company offers on going trade promotion programs with customers  and consumer coupon programs that require the company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs 
programs include cooperative marketing programs  shelf price reductions  coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailers stores and other promotional activity 
costs related to rebates  co operative advertising and other promotional activity are recorded upon delivery of products to customers 
costs related to coupon offers are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as incurred  when coupons are circulated 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
the company tracks sales incentives and accrues for the estimated incurred but unpaid portion of trade promotion events 
the determination of sales incentive liabilities requires the company to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns  status of trade promotional activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates fluctuate from the estimated rate 
if the company s accrual estimates for sales incentives at august  were to differ by  the impact on net sales would be approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain positions may be challenged and that the company s positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company s tax contingency accruals are reflected as a component of income taxes payable 
us income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes  special areas 
the company determines whether its foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassesses this determination on a periodic basis 
change to the company s determination may be warranted based on the company s experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangibles determined to have indefinite lives  impairment is tested at least annually under the guidance of sfas no 
 during our second fiscal quarter of each year unless there are indicators during an interim period that assets may have become impaired 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment such as forecasted revenue  advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
for goodwill  impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
for intangible assets  impairment occurs when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
events and circumstances that we consider important which could trigger impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  decreased market capitalization relative to net book value  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key distribution  loss of key personnel  and acts by government and courts 
when there is indication that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
when there is an indication of impairment of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company tested its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on future discounted cash flows compared to related book values 
based on this review  the company determined that there were no instances of impairment

this pronouncement will also require companies that are considering repatriating earnings to disclose the status of their evaluation and the potential amounts being considered for repatriation 
the company continues to evaluate its plans for repatriation of any foreign earnings in light of its ongoing business considerations and continues to evaluate this legislation and fsp no 
to determine the impact  if any  that this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to conclude its analysis by the second quarter of fiscal year as a result  the range of income tax effects of any such potential repatriation cannot currently be reasonably estimated

transactions with related parties vml company llc vml was formed in april  at which time the company acquired a membership interest 
since formation  vml has served as the company s contract manufacturer for certain household products and acts as a warehouse distributor for other product lines of the company 
although vml has begun to expand its business to other customers  the company continues to be its largest customer 
vml makes profit distributions to the company and the owner on a discretionary basis in proportion to each party s respective interest 
the company has a put option to sell its interest in vml to the owner  and the owner has a call option to purchase the company s interest 
the sale price in each case is established pursuant to formulas based on vml s operating results 
under financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 vml qualifies as a variable interest entity  and it has been determined that the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the company s investment in vml is accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and its equity in vml earnings is recorded as a component of cost of products sold  as vml acts primarily as a contract manufacturer to the company 
the company recorded equity earnings related to its investment in vml of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with vml was million as of august  this amount represents the balance of the company s equity investment in vml  which is presented as investment in related party on the company s balance sheet 
the company s investment in vml as of august  was million 
cost of products sold which were purchased from vml  net of rebates  equity earnings and accretion of investment  was approximately million  million and million during the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the company had product payables to vml of million at august  and august  additionally  the company receives rental income from vml  which is recorded as a component of other income expense  net 
rental income from vml was million for each of the fiscal years ended august   and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of its business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company s uk subsidiary utilizes forward contracts to limit its exposure on converting cash balances maintained in euros into british sterling 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
while the company engages in foreign currency hedging activity to reduce its risk  for accounting purposes  none of the foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges 
interest rate risk as of august   the company has a million  fixed rate term loan  along with a million revolving line of credit 
only the million revolving line of credit is subject to interest rate fluctuations  with a variable interest rate based on the libor rate plus 
any significant increase in the libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense incurred on any borrowings outstanding on the line of credit 
the company s interest rate risk on the outstanding line of credit balance is based upon the fluctuation in the libor rate 
as of august   there was no balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
currently  the company is not exposed to interest rate risk as the line of credit matured in october  and the company did not renew the line of credit 
other risk factors component supply risk the company depends upon its suppliers for the supply of the primary components for its wd brand and other products 
such components are subject to significant price volatility beyond the control or influence of the company 
petroleum based products  from which wd and in one are manufactured  have had significant price volatility in the past  and may in the future 
rising oil prices also impact the company s cost of transporting its products 
historically  the company has generally found alternate sources of constituent chemicals for its products readily available 
as component and raw material costs are the main contribution to cost of goods sold for all of the company s products  any significant fluctuation in the costs of components could also have a material impact on the gross margins realized on the company s products 
specifically  future can prices are exposed to fluctuations resulting from changes in tariffs on steel as well as general supply and demand economics  therefore any significant increase or decrease in steel tariffs and or the supply and demand of steel could have a significant impact on the costs of purchasing cans and the company s cost of goods 
in the event there is more significant price volatility or higher component costs generally  the company may not be able to maintain  or may choose not to maintain  its gross margins by raising its product prices without affecting demand and unit sales 
increases in the prices for the components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
reliance on supply chain the company relies on third party contract manufacturers for the production of its finished goods 
the company does not have direct control over the management or business of the primary contract manufacturers utilized in the manufacturing of the company s products  except indirectly through terms as negotiated in contracts with those manufacturers 
should the terms of doing business with the company s primary contract manufacturers change  the company s cost structure may be impacted  which could have a direct impact on the company s profit margins 
the company s contract manufacturers rely upon two key vendors for the supply of empty cans used in the production of wd  carpet fresh  in one  spot shot  x and products 
additionally  the company relies on single manufacturers for the production of flushes and x automatic toilet bowl cleaners  x hard surface cleaners  carpet fresh powder and its lava bar soap 
the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers could disrupt or interrupt the production of the company s products 
although the company has an emergency recovery plan to help mitigate the potential loss of suppliers or manufacturers  the inability to replace lost suppliers or manufacturers in a reasonable amount of time could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive and is expected to be increasingly competitive in the future 
the company s products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels  competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space 
competition in international markets varies by country 
the company is aware of many competing products  some of which sell for lower prices  however  the company relies on the awareness of its brands among consumers  the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers  and its multiple channel distribution as its primary competitive strategies 
these considerations as well as increased competition generally could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and a loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
political and economic risks the company s domestic and international operations are exposed to the risk of political and economic uncertainties 
changes in political and economic conditions may affect product cost  availability  distribution  pricing  purchasing  and consumption patterns 
while the company seeks to manage its business in consideration of these risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
as the company s sales extend to various countries around the globe  financial results in affected areas are exposed to a higher degree of risk 
examples of regions currently exposed to such types of risk include latin america  the middle east and parts of asia 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully mitigate against current and future risk associated with political and economic uncertainties  or that the risks faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
as sales grow within various regions around the world  the company s exposure to this risk will increase 
business risks with the trend toward consolidation in the retail marketplace  the company s customer base is shifting toward fewer  but larger  customers who purchase in larger volumes 
a large percentage of the company s sales are to mass retail customers 
sales to one of these customers wal mart and affiliates accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal year the spot shot brand is presently sold to two major us customers 
each customer accounted for approximately and of total fiscal year spot shot net sales  respectively 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from any of the company s most significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
large customers also seek price reductions  added support or promotional concessions  which may negatively impact the company s ability to maintain existing profit margins 
in addition  the company is subject to changes in customer purchasing patterns 
these types of changes may result from changes in the manner in which customers purchase and manage inventory levels  or display and promote products within their stores 
other potential factors such as customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters may also impact operating results 
the company also faces the risk of diminishing product categories or shifts within these categories 
currently  the company faces challenges related to its household products brands 
household products have short differentiated life cycles and often need continuous innovation to address consumers changing needs and tastes 
as a result of the dynamic nature of these product categories  the ability to understand consumer preferences and innovate is key to the company s ongoing success 
in the event that the company is unable to meet consumer preferences through innovation  its brands and product offerings may be at risk of impairment 
operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations 
if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition  or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals  then the company s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations 
the company s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors  including the following the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  the effectiveness of the company s advertising  marketing and promotional programs  changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes of accounting policies  the ability of the company to achieve business plans  including volume growth and pricing plans  as a result of high levels of competitive activity  the ability to maintain key customer relationships  the ability of major customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they come due  the ability to successfully manage regulatory  tax and legal matters  including resolution of pending matters within current estimates  substantial costs associated with regulatory compliance  the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel  and expenses for impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections 
regulatory risks the company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on its business operations  including  among other things  the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the handling  use  treatment  storage and clean up of solid and hazardous wastes and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may otherwise relate to various health and safety matters that impose burdens upon the company s operations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up current sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
the company believes that its expenditures related to environmental matters have not had  and are not currently expected to have  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the environmental laws under which the company operates are complicated and often increasingly more stringent  and may be applied retroactively 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of the company s products have chemical compositions that are controlled by various state  federal and international laws and regulations 
the company complies with these laws and regulations and seeks to anticipate developments that could impact the company s ability to continue to produce and market its products 
the company invests in research and development to maintain product formulations that comply with such laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to alter the chemical composition of one or more of the company s products in such a way that will not have an adverse effect upon the product s efficacy or marketability 
a delay or other inability of the company to complete product research and development in response to any such regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a focus on environmental regulations relating to volatile organic compounds vocs resulted in a change in the formulation of the wd product in the majority of countries where the product is sold  whereby co was chosen as the aerosol propellant in as a result of this change  the cost of manufacturing wd was increased and the company increased its selling prices to partially offset the additional cost 
in the event of future increases in product cost  the company may not be in a position to raise selling prices  and therefore an increase in costs could have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
in california  vocs are regulated by the california air resources board carb 
carb regulations required a reformulation of the company s multi purpose lubricants 
the company successfully reformulated its multipurpose lubricants to be in full compliance with carb regulations 
the reformulation has resulted in increased product costs 
in conjunction with the review of the state budget  california gave carb the approval to enforce a fee based system which would allow it to collect fees from those it governs on the voc issues 
these fees will go into carb s operating budget and help cover shortfalls  and are said to be based on the amount of vocs a company s product puts into the state s atmosphere 
if a similar voc policy is adopted by other states  the potential impact of fees charged could be material to the company 
generally  the manufacturing  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products and the company s business operations all must comply with extensive federal  state  and foreign laws and regulations 
it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation  storage or use of certain chemicals  to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 
acquisition risk since  the company has acquired the household product brands spot shot  flushes  x  carpet fresh and the company believes that its recent acquisitions provide opportunities for growth for all of the company s brands as well as increased efficiencies and cost savings in management  operations and marketing 
however  if the company is not able to successfully integrate acquired products  the company may not be able to maximize these opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate these acquired businesses because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
one of the company s strategies is to increase its sales volumes  earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of other businesses in the united states and internationally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions into its operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made 
debt financing risk the company has historically paid out a large part of its earnings to stockholders in the form of regular quarterly dividends 
the past acquisitions have been funded to a large extent by debt 
in order to service the debt  the company is required to use its income from operations to make interest and principal payments required by the terms of the loan agreements 
in addition  the company is required by covenants within the loan agreements to maintain certain financial ratios and compliance with other financial terms 
the company believes that the increased income from operations derived from the acquired businesses will fully cover the debt service requirements 
in fiscal years and  the company announced reductions to its regular quarterly dividend from to per share in april and from to per share in july reducing the annual dividend since april from to in order to make more of its cash flow available for debt service requirements 
in april  the company announced an increase to its regular quarterly dividend from to per share increasing the annual dividend from to 
however  if operating income is not sufficient to properly service the debt or otherwise allow the company to maintain compliance with the terms of its loans  the company could be required to seek additional financing through the issuance of more debt or the sale of equity securities  or the company might be required to reduce dividends 
an increase in the company s debt service obligations could result in lower earnings if anticipated gross and net margins are not maintained 
protection of intellectual property the company relies on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property 
the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  laws of some of the foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the company could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company frequently defends its brands from counterfeits across asia through legal and enforcement actions 
in addition  the company has introduced uniquely shaped packaging that the company believes will reduce the ability of counterfeiters to imitate the company s products 
volatility in the insurance market the company re evaluates its insurance coverage annually
