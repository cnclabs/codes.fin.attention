the company believes that this consistency is a critical prerequisite to better serving its clients  since it will provide a uniform foundation for propagating best practices throughout the world 
another area the company is addressing is gaining cost efficiencies through the standardization of the more routine sub components of the recovery audit process that lend themselves to greater efficiency and cost effectiveness when performed in a specialized  centralized work group setting

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of its financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
accounting policies that involve the use of estimates that meet both of the following criteria are considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
first  the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate is made 
second  alternate estimates in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely in future periods  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to estimates that meet the critical estimate criteria  the company also makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  information available prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this information forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including changes in those estimates not deemed critical 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this form k have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on the accrual basis except with respect to its meridian business unit  channel revenue  a division of accounts payable services  and certain international accounts payable services units where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recognized for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that our clients have received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors  and when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
the determination that each of the aforementioned criteria are met  particularly the determination of the timing of economic benefit received by the client and the determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  requires the application of significant judgment by management and a misapplication of this judgment could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of its clients to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowances on a periodic basis 
the valuation includes  but is not limited to  historical loss experience  the aging of current accounts 
table of contents receivable balances and provisions for adverse situations that may affect a client s ability to pay 
if the evaluation of allowance requirements differs from the actual aggregate allowance  adjustments are made to the allowance 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
if the financial condition of any of the company s clients were to deteriorate  or their operating climates were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if the company s estimate of required allowances for doubtful accounts is determined to be insufficient  it could result in decreased operating income in the period such determination is made 
conversely  if a client subsequently remits cash for an accounts receivable balance which has previously been written off  it could result in increased operating income in the period in which the payment is received 
a hypothetical change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have a million impact on operating income 
paybacks and chargebacks 
the company has calculated an estimate of amounts that could be potentially paid back to customers in the form of a cash payment or credit against future invoicings to that customer 
historically  there has been a certain amount of revenues that  even though meeting all requirements of the company s revenue recognition policy  our customers vendors have ultimately rejected the claims underlying such revenues 
in that case  our customers  even though cash may have been collected by the company  may request a refund of such amount 
the company has recorded such refunds as a reduction of revenue 
during  the company experienced a million decrease in revenues due to a change in the estimate related to customer paybacks 
in the future  if the company was to underestimate the amount of revenue that could potentially be paid or credited back to customers  then revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely impacted 
a hypothetical change in paybacks and chargebacks would have a million impact on operating income 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   the company had a consolidated goodwill asset of million relating to the accounts payable services segment and other intangible assets of million  including intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of million  relating to the accounts payable services segment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the goodwill impairment valuation is a two part test 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is developed and compared with its recorded book value 
if the fair value is less than the book value  a second test is required 
to the extent that management or its independent valuation advisors misjudges or miscalculates any of the critical factors necessary to determine the fair value of its reporting units or intangible assets  future earnings could be materially adversely impacted 
income taxes 
the company s reported effective tax rate approximated  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate is based on historical and anticipated future taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in its consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the company s tax returns  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the company s tax returns in future years for which it has already recorded the tax benefit in the income statement 
the company establishes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that it believes are more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances are adjusted in light of changing 
table of contents facts and circumstances 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expense for which a deduction has already been taken on the company s tax returns but has not yet been recognized as an expense in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
in making this determination  management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets  including the company s past and anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the length of carry back and carry forward periods  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists 
cumulative losses in recent years are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination 
for the year ended december  the company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance against its remaining net deferred tax assets of million 
this increase was offset by the use of approximately million of capital loss carry forwards resulting in a net change in the valuation allowance of approximately million 
the company expects to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained 
over time  the company believes it will fully utilize these assets as its results continue to improve 
in addition  the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  included in item of this form k reflects a net deferred income tax liability of million million current deferred tax asset and million long term deferred tax liability

accounts payable services revenues 
accounts payable services revenues for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions domestic accounts payable services revenue retail commercial international accounts payable services revenue total accounts payable services revenue for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   the company experienced a decrease in revenues for domestic retail accounts payable services 
this decrease was due to a 
table of contents million decrease in base retail audit revenue and a million decrease in revenues due to a change in the estimate related to customer paybacks 
partially offsetting these decreases were a million increase in the company s sales and use tax operations as well as a million settlement for past services rendered to an existing client but for which revenues had not been previously recognized 
these increases are not expected to be recurring items in future periods  although the company has experienced large sales and use tax revenues in some periods in the past and could do so in the future 
management believes the decrease in base retail audit revenue was largely attributable to customers increased use of their own internal post audit functions and continuing changes in the claims approval and processing patterns in some of the company s largest retail accounts whereby the elapsed time between claim identification by the company and claim recovery by our clients has been elongated and some claims have lapsed as unrecoverable due to additional challenges associated with the passage of time 
the company believes that well publicized inquiries during by the united states securities and exchange commission into the accounting by retailers for vendor supplied promotional allowances have caused many of its largest clients to slow the approval and processing of claims against vendors as related policies and procedures are re examined 
the company believes that this trend has stabilized 
also  some of our domestic retail accounts payable services clients generally continue to take a more conservative approach towards claims recognition  and we expect clients to continue to attempt to use their own internal post audit functions as a substitute for some or all of our services 
revenues from the company s domestic commercial accounts payable services clients also declined during the year ended december  compared to the same period of the period over period decrease was largely due to fewer audit starts in the first six months of as a result  the company has focused its sales effort on new client opportunities within the disbursement audit services arena resulting in an improvement in signed contracts during the second half of as compared to the first half of this resulted in an improvement in the company s audit start trend 
to date  disbursement audit services which typically entail acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories have tended to be either one time with no subsequent repeat or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client often audited in pre arranged annual sequences 
revenues derived from a given client may change markedly from period to period 
claims productivity on disbursement audits improved during the company also continues its focus on converting a substantial number of its current domestic commercial accounts payable services to contract compliance audits 
the improvement in audit start trends  combined with increased claims productivity and increased focus on contract compliance audits  could potentially result in higher commercial revenues in for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the company experienced a decline in revenues for domestic retail accounts payable services 
this decline was primarily the result of a revenues lost in as certain larger clients of the post merger prg schultz combined operation utilized other recovery audit service providers for a portion of their overall needs  b revenues lost in after one of the company s larger clients filed for chapter bankruptcy reorganization on april  million  c a generally weak retailing environment in which aggregate client purchasing volumes have been depressed  d changes in the claims approval and processing patterns in some of the company s largest retail accounts whereby the elapsed time between claim identification by the company and claim recovery by our clients has been elongated and some claims have lapsed as unrecoverable due to additional challenges associated with the passage of time  and e reduced claims due to improvements in some clients internal recovery capabilities 
the company believes that well publicized inquiries during by the united states securities and exchange commission into the accounting by retailers for vendor supplied promotional allowances have caused many of its largest clients to slow the approval and processing of claims against vendors as related policies and procedures are re examined 
revenues from the company s domestic commercial accounts payable services clients also declined during compared to the year over year decreases were largely due to fewer audit starts as a result of the nature of the commercial audit cycle  as discussed further below 
also contributing to the decrease in revenues from commercial clients is the maturing of the market for providing disbursement recovery audit services which typically entails acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories to commercial entities in the united states 
to date  disbursement audit 
table of contents services have tended to be either one time with no subsequent repeat or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client often audited in pre arranged annual sequences 
accordingly  revenues derived from a given client may change markedly from period to period 
the decrease in revenues from the international portion of accounts payable services in the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to client specific issues in the company s european operations million and a lengthened approval process in the company s canadian operations million 
additionally  the company experienced a decrease in revenues of million for the year ended december  from one large client acquired as part of the january  acquisition of the businesses of howard schultz associates international  inc and affiliates hsa texas for which the company provides airline ticket revenue recovery audit services primarily due to a decrease in claims and an increase of paybacks during the current period when compared to the same period of the prior year 
these decreases in revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues attributable to strengthening of the local currencies of the company s international accounts payable services operations  as a whole  relative to the us dollar for the year ended december  million 
during the third quarter of  the company also reengaged with a large retailer in the united kingdom and reached an agreement to be paid a minimum of million at december  exchange rates through february of the million  million has been deferred at december  the deferred revenues will be recognized in future periods as claims recoveries are made under the new client service agreement 
further  during the second half of  the company signed service contracts with customers expected to lead to an increase in revenues in until the board has completed the process of exploring strategic alternatives  as discussed above  uncertainty as to the outcome of the process may cause the company to experience a reduction in revenues relating to potential customer turnover 
the increase in revenues from international accounts payable services for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the prior year is primarily attributable to increased revenues generated by the company s canadian operations combined with increased revenues from one large client acquired as part of the company s january  acquisition of the businesses of hsa texas for which the company provides airline ticket revenue recovery audit services  as well as increased revenues generated by the company s asian operations 
the company s canadian operations experienced increased revenues period over period as a result of a strengthening of the local currency to the us dollar when compared to currency rates for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in year over year revenues generated by airline ticket revenue recovery audit services was due to a change in the company s contract arrangement with one large client and an increase in the number of categories on which the company has been able to write claims 
the increased revenues year over year experienced by the asian operations resulted from the fact that during the quarter ended march   the company recorded no revenues from its asian operations due to certain transitional considerations associated with the acquisitions of the businesses of hsa texas 
partially offsetting these increases in international revenues were declines in revenues from the company s latin american and european operations 
revenues from the company s latin american operations were down year over year primarily due to decreases in revenues generated from its client base 
the decline in revenues from european accounts  primarily within the united kingdom  was due to a decrease in revenues generated from the existing client base as a result of a year over year change in client mix 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in revenues attributable to strengthening of the local currency to the us dollar during when compared to currency rates for the same period of the prior year million 
cost of revenues cor 
cor consists principally of commissions paid or payable to the company s auditors based primarily upon the level of overpayment recoveries  and compensation paid to various types of hourly workers and salaried operational managers 
also included in cor are other direct costs incurred by these personnel  including rental of non headquarters offices  travel and entertainment  telephone  utilities  maintenance and supplies and clerical assistance 
a significant portion of the components comprising cor for the company s domestic accounts payable services operations are variable compensation related costs and will increase or decrease with increases and decreases in revenues 
the cor support base for 
table of contents domestic retail and domestic commercial operations are not separately distinguishable and are not evaluated by management individually 
the company s international accounts payable services also have a portion of their cor  although less than domestic accounts payable services  that will vary with revenues

this improvement in cor as a percentage of revenues was largely driven by cost reductions in the company s us accounts payable services operations where the company s strategic business initiatives  as previously discussed  have been implemented 
the company has reduced its headcount in its domestic accounts payable services operations  year over year  by approximately in connection with its strategic business initiatives 
the dollar decrease in cor for compared to for domestic accounts payable services was primarily due to lower revenues during and correspondingly lower costs that vary with revenues

partially offsetting these increases were local currency decreases in cor experienced by the company s latin american operations 
the increase in cor for international accounts payable services with airline ticket revenue recovery audit services currently provided to one large client directly related to increased revenues derived from this client  as discussed above  when compared to the same period of the prior year 
the improvement in cor for the company s latin american operations was primarily due to a reduction in personnel and a change in the commission structure for some of the auditors in the latin american operations

during the period of may through september  meridian received grants from the industrial development authority of ireland ida in the sum of million euro million at december  exchange rates 
the grants were paid primarily to stimulate the creation of permanent jobs in ireland 
as a condition of the grants  if the number of permanently employed meridian staff in ireland falls below  then the grants are repayable in full 
this contingency expires on september  meridian currently employs permanent employees in dublin  ireland 
the european union eu has currently proposed legislation that will remove the need for suppliers to charge vat on the supply of services to clients within the eu 
the effective date of the proposed legislation is currently unknown 
management estimates that the proposed legislation  if enacted as currently drafted  would eventually have a material adverse impact on meridian s results of operations from its value added tax business 
if meridian s results of operations were to decline as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation  it is possible that the number of permanent employees that meridian employs in ireland could fall below prior to september should such an event occur  the full amount of the grants previously received by meridian will need to be repaid to ida 
however  management currently estimates that any impact on employment levels related to a possible change in the eu legislation will not be realized until after september  if ever 
as any potential liability related to these grants is not currently determinable  the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  does not include any expense related to this matter 
management is monitoring this situation and if it appears probable meridian s permanent staff in ireland will fall below and that grants will need to be repaid to ida  meridian will be required to recognize an expense at that time 
this expense could be material to meridian s results of operations 
the company s current intention is to expand the service offerings of meridian to offer outsourced accounts payable and employee expense reimbursement processing and redirect most of the meridian employees who may be affected by the proposed legislation to provide services to its core accounts payable services business 
the company believes that this redirection will significantly enhance its accounts payable services business internationally as well as provide the peripheral benefit of mitigating the risk of a future ida grant repayment 
the company has adopted a strategic plan to revitalize the business and respond to the changing competitive environment 
the strategic plan focuses on a series of initiatives designed to maintain the company s dedicated focus on its clients and rekindle the company s growth

some of these key initiatives include 
table of contents centralize claim processing and field audit work  standardize audit software and processes  implement technology platforms  and optimize the organization 
the company has begun implementation of the strategy but remains in the intermediate stages of that process 
each of the initiatives requires sustained management focus  organization and coordination over time  as well as success in building relationships with third parties 
the results of the strategy and implementation will not be known until some time in the future 
during and  total costs incurred relating to the implementation totaled million and million  respectively 
implementation costs in are expected to be approximately million less than in if the company is unable to implement the strategy successfully  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of the strategy may require material increases in costs and expenses 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures in the range of million to million during  including approximately million to million of capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred related to the company s model evolution efforts under its strategic plan 
the company believes that its working capital  current availability under its senior credit facility  and cash flows generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements through december  unless it is required to make unanticipated accelerated debt repayments due to future unanticipated violations of the senior credit facility that are not waived by the lender 
if a future credit ratio covenant violation under the senior credit facility does occur  and if the lender declares the then outstanding principal to be immediately due and payable  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional financing that will be required to make such a rapid repayment 
additionally  if such a lender accelerated repayment demand is subsequently made and the company is unable to honor it  cross default language contained in the indenture underlying the company s separately outstanding million convertible notes issue  due november   could also be triggered  potentially accelerating the required repayment of those notes as well 
in such an instance  there can likewise be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional financing that would be required to make such a rapid repayment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risk 
our functional currency is the us dollar although we transact business in various foreign locations and currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the value of nonfunctional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of revenues increases 
overall  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar 
we are therefore adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
interest rate risk 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt 
at december   we had fixed rate convertible notes outstanding with a principal amount of million which bear interest at per annum 
at december   we had no variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates on variable rate debt during the twelve months ended december  would have resulted in approximately a million change in pre tax income 
derivative instruments 
as a multi national company  the company faces risks related to foreign currency fluctuations on its foreign denominated cash flows  net earnings  new investments and large foreign currency denominated transactions 
the company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage foreign currency risks 
the use of financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk to the company 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes  nor does it use leveraged financial instruments 
the company did not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of december  see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k
