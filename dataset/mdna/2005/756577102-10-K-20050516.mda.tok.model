overview we are the global leader in providing an enterprise operating system and related software and services based on open source technology for large enterprises 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software 
there are no licensing fees associated with open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself 
we provide value to our customers through the integration and testing of red hat enterprise technologies  the levels of performance of red hat enterprise technologies and rapid innovation of red hat enterprise technologies in a method that allows this innovation to be consumed by our customers 
in addition  we provide certain managed services for each of our technologies through rhn  as a standard component of our subscriptions 
we sell our enterprise technologies  such as rhel  through subscriptions  and we recognize revenue over the period of the enterprise technology services subscription agreements with our customers 
our products and services are offered primarily to large enterprises  government organizations  and small and medium size businesses 
we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for our enterprise technologies rhel as  es and ws and rhn for the past three fiscal years 
in  we introduced our initial rhel offering  rhel as  formerly called advanced server 
since its initial introduction  rhel has gained widespread isv and ihv support 
we have continued to focus on our enterprise line of technologies by expanding our enterprise operating platform offerings and introducing new systems management services 
as discussed in our critical accounting policies below  these offerings typically have revenue recognition periods which match the subscription periods 
we derive our revenues and generate cash from customers from two sources i subscription revenue  which includes retail  enterprise subscriptions and embedded subscription revenue  and ii services revenue which includes enterprise services and embedded services described under critical accounting policies below 
for fiscal and  our total revenues were million and million  respectively 
the arrangements with our customers that create enterprise subscription revenues are explained in further detail under critical accounting policies below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these agreements typically involve the sale of subscriptions to rhel and in certain cases will include the sales of subscriptions to other red hat subscription offerings or red hat services 
our revenues are also affected by corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors 
these factors include total revenues  operating income  operating margin and cash flows 
in addition  we also consider the following factors in our evaluation process subscriptions 
our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period 
the base subscription entitles the end user to maintenance  which entitles the end user to configuration support and updates and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription through rhn 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription revenue increased each quarter during fiscal and and is being driven primarily by the market acceptance of using the linux operating system in enterprise data centers and our expansion of sales channels during the year 
sales by geography 
we operate our business in three geographic regions the americas us  latin america and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific singapore  japan  india  australia  korea and china 
in fiscal  million or of our revenue was generated outside north america compared to million or in fiscal the percentage of our revenues generated from our international operations is expected to increase as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
the increase in our international revenues reflects the increasing adoption of the linux operating system in both europe and asia 
as noted in the segment reporting section of note to the consolidated financial statements  our revenue in both emea and asia pacific increased at higher percentages than in north america 
we have offices in more than locations throughout the world 
deferred revenue balances 
our deferred revenue balance at february  was million 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenues improve predictability of future revenues 
deferred revenues at february   have increased by more than as compared to the balance on february  cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities 
cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities balances at february  totaled million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions to rhel during the fiscal year 
our significant cash balance gives us the ability to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  increase investment in international areas and purchase our own common stock and debt securities 
in fiscal  we focused on  among other things  i continuing to build on the global market momentum behind the adoption of linux as an operating system by enterprise customers  ii continuing our market penetration through channel partners and internationally  iii driving high renewal rates of subscriptions sold in prior periods and iv increasing the contribution to our subscription sales by intel hardware vendors 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and deferred taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  sop as amended by sop and sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of enterprise  retail and embedded revenues 
accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding agreement for the purchase of a subscription  subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed 
the deferred revenue amount is amortized to income as discussed below 
enterprise subscription revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from sales of rhel technology solutions  however  through april  we also generated enterprise subscription revenue from sales of red hat linux and related software development tools 
during fiscal  we released the first version of our rhel offerings  rhel as 
in march  two additional versions of rhel were released  rhel es and rhel ws 
red hat enterprise technologies are offered with either one or three year base subscription periods  the majority of our subscriptions have one year terms 
under these subscription agreements  renewal rates are generally specified for one or three year renewal terms 
the base subscription entitles the end user to the technology itself and post contract customer support pcs consisting of security errata  updates to the technology  upgrades to new versions of rhel  on a when and if available basis  during the term of the subscription 
we sell rhel through four channels distribution  direct sales  original equipment manufacturers oems and the web 
we recognize revenue from the sale of rhel offerings ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement 
we do not sell the rhel technology or the components of the pcs that are included in the subscription on a stand alone basis 
subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements eg  software technology  maintenance  training  consulting and other services 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of its fair value when we can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least those elements that are undelivered 
the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is created by either i providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to renew that element at the same rate paid for the element included in the initial term of the agreement or ii selling the services on a stand alone basis 
enterprise subscription revenue also includes revenue from large unix to linux migration arrangements that were sold prior to the release of rhel in fiscal revenue from these pre rhel arrangements has generally been recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as no pattern of performance is sufficiently discernible to allow for other than ratable recognition 
these arrangements lapsed in or prior to the second quarter of fiscal in addition  our enterprise subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of our rhn offerings 
rhn is a company hosted  internet based set of services to help assure the security  availability and reliability of all of our red hat technology solutions that we offer 
rhn may be subscribed to at the time of  and in addition to  one of our rhel offerings or on a stand alone basis 
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription 
through our retail distributors  we sold red hat linux consumer products 
the retail product was offered in one version during fiscal red hat professional workstation 
during fiscal  we sold two different versions of red hat linux and professional workstation 
in accordance with sop  the revenue associated with products whose subscription period is days or less is recognized immediately because the cost to us associated with such subscriptions is de minimis 
for retail products whose subscription period for support services is greater than days  we recognize the revenue ratably over the period that the subscription services are provided beginning on the estimated date of purchase by the end user 
a reserve for sales returns is recognized for sales of retail software products to distributors  who have a right of return  based on our historical experience of sell through to the end user by the distributor 
the predominant portion of our retail distribution agreements provide that distributors only have days from date of original shipment to return unsold product 
we recognize revenues from sales of retail products with subscription periods less than days upon shipment to the distributor because we are able to estimate returns with a reasonable degree of accuracy  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
our retail customers do not receive the right to future upgrades or new versions of the technology 
embedded subscription consists of revenue for technical support and maintenance services provided pursuant to software compiling  debugging  and optimization agreements 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically months 
services revenue services revenue is comprised of enterprise technology services and embedded development 
enterprise technology services are comprised of revenue for enterprise consulting and engineering services  and customer training and education 
enterprise technology consulting services are provided under agreements in which customers pay us on a fixed fee or hourly basis to assist in the deployment of enterprise technologies 
enterprise technology engineering services represent revenues earned under fixed fee or hourly arrangements principally with our oem partners to add functionality to our rhel line of technologies 
revenues under hourly arrangements are recognized as work is performed 
revenues under fixed fee arrangements are recognized either on a proportional performance basis ie  if the arrangement involves the delivery of software that includes significant production  customization and modification or upon passage of time dependent upon the terms of each individual engagement 
revenue from customer training and education is recognized as the services are performed 
embedded development services are contracts for software compiling  debugging  and optimization 
revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method  provided that the company has the ability to make reliable estimates of future performance requirements  the fee for such services is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
we perform this assessment on an annual basis  typically during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve for the benefit of its deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realization of these deferred tax assets 
during the year ended february   we reversed million of our valuation allowance pertaining to certain foreign deferred tax assets that became more likely than not to be realized 
we will continue to assess the realizability of other deferred tax assets which primarily consist of net operating losses and stock option expense deductions in the united states 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in making this assessment  management considers historical trend of taxable losses  projected future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
as of february   we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against the majority of its deferred tax assets arising from tax losses in the united states due primarily to i cumulative losses in recent periods  ii uncertainty related to stock option exercises and related tax deductions generated  and iii inherent difficulties in forecasting future taxable income as a result of rapidly changing technology and our competitive environment 
however  if our positive trend of earnings continues  it is likely the valuation allowance will be reversed at some point in the future although we cannot predict which quarter this will occur 
we anticipate that reversal will occur no later than the quarter in which our analysis of cumulative losses  adjusted for the impact of permanent items primarily stock option exercise deductions  becomes positive 
after the date on which the valuation allowance is fully reversed  we will begin to recognize a tax provision  with respect to us federal taxes  on a quarterly basis 
results of operations years ended february  and february  subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of revenue from enterprise technologies  retail product and embedded customers 
subscription revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  enterprise technologies subscription enterprise technologies subscription revenue primarily relates to both direct and indirect sales of red hat enterprise technologies 
enterprise technologies subscription revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the increase in subscription revenue sales is being driven by broad market acceptance and the increasing use of the linux operating system in mission critical areas of computing by the large enterprise  as well as increasing revenue through oem and distributor relationships that we have developed over the past three years 
our sales force has also increased to better address the growing market opportunity 
retail technologies retail revenue  which consists of sales of red hat linux and professional workstation both of which we discontinued by february to consumers through either value added resellers or distributors  decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  this decrease is due to our focus on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprises rather than on the consumer market 
this market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for us 
we do not anticipate promoting new products through this channel 
retail revenues are not currently a significant component of our revenues 
embedded subscription embedded subscription revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  despite the year over year decrease in revenues  we see interest in the use of rhel as an operating system for certain devices such as network routing equipment and accordingly  we believe there may be an opportunity to increase our participation in the embedded market 
services revenue enterprise technologies services enterprise technologies services revenues include fees for services received from enterprise customers for deployment of red hat enterprise technologies  customer training and education fees and fees received for adding certain functionality to rhel for our major hardware oem partners 
enterprise technology services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in enterprise technologies services revenue is primarily due to an increase in the revenues earned from customer training and education of million 
we continue to view our customer training and education business as an indicator of demand for the use of our rhel technologies by enterprise customers 
the adoption of linux as a primary computing platform increases the need to train system administrators and developers 
this increase was offset by a decrease in consulting fees received from enterprise customers for deployment of red hat enterprise technologies of approximately million and a decrease in the services revenues earned from agreements with our oem partners for adding functionality of million 
embedded services embedded services revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the reduction primarily relates to our reduced focus and personnel on this business to a small core team which maintains a strategic presence in this marketplace  though we see continued interest in integrating the linux operating system in certain devices and systems 
cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue the cost of enterprise technologies and retail subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to manufacture  package  distribute and support our solutions 
these costs include expenses for physical media  literature and packaging  fulfillment and shipping  labor related costs to provide technical support and maintenance of which the largest component is labor cost 
cost of subscription revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is the result of additions to our technical support staff at each of our three call center locations to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base due to the increased number of subscriptions to rhel that we sold during fiscal as the number of subscriptions for rhel continues to increase  our cost of subscription revenues will also increase  although we anticipate this will occur at a slower rate than revenues 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs incurred for our personnel to deliver custom development  open source consulting engineering  training and education  and hardware certification services 
cost of services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is directly related to the increase in our enterprise technologies services revenue 
the cost of our customer training and education services increased million  which is consistent with the increase in revenue of these services 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in our professional consulting costs related to headcount reductions to our consulting staff during fiscal and as we have revised our consulting strategy to focus on strategic relationships with key customers with larger linux deployments 
in addition  the cost of our embedded segment has decreased million due to a reduction in this workforce 
gross profit gross profit increased to million of total revenue in the year ended february  from million of total revenue in the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our rhel offerings 
the growth and profitability of our enterprise subscription business was offset by a decline in the embedded segment  which had gross profit of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expense increased to million of total revenue in the year ended february  from million of total revenue in the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in enterprise sales costs as we increased the size of each of our sales teams including  inside sales  direct outside sales and channel sales as well as a million increase in our marketing costs 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for development of software technologies and systems management offerings 
research and development expense increased to million of total revenue in the year ended february  from million of total revenue in the year ended february  the increase in research and development expense resulted from an increase in engineering headcount to support the development and integration of our rhel operating platforms as well as our desktop and storage products 
we acquired sistina  inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal and added approximately million per quarter in cost related to sistina s file storage development team 
we have also been adding resources to our desktop team and the cost associated with this team has increased by million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
finally  as part of the netscape security solutions acquisition from aol  we added engineering costs of approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  facilities and information systems expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million of total revenue in the year ended february  from million of total revenue in the year ended february  the largest portion of the increase relates to professional fees of million incurred in connection with the restatement of certain of our previously filed financial statements in the summer of and related litigation  sarbanes oxley section compliance and other consulting services related to our long term compensation plans 
payroll costs increased by million which is due to higher compensation and benefits associated with increased headcount 
facility costs and depreciation increased by million during the year primarily related to additional office space and additional system costs associated with increased staffing 
other administrative costs such as bank fees  property and franchise taxes and travel costs comprise the remainder of the increase 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  costs incurred for acquiring trademarks  copyrights and patents are capitalized as intangibles and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to ten years 
the increase is due to additional amortization of intangibles associated with acquired intangibles related to the acquisition of sistina software  inc and certain assets from netscape security solutions 
other income other income consists of interest income earned on cash deposited in money market accounts and invested in short and long term fixed income instruments and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and investments  net 
other income increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is primarily due to increased interest income associated with the increase in our cash and investment balances as a result of our convertible debenture offering in january interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense incurred on short term debt  capital leases and the convertible debentures 
interest expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is principally related to interest expense associated with the convertible debentures  including amortization of debt issuance costs 
income tax benefit during the year ended february   we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately million 
we recorded million of income tax expense and recognized a million deferred tax benefit  primarily related to the reversal of the valuation allowance pertaining to certain foreign deferred tax assets as it was determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these foreign jurisdictions would be realized 
there was no provision or benefit recorded during the year ended february  years ended february  and february  subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of revenue from enterprise technologies  retail product and embedded customers

retail technologies retail revenue  which consists of sales of red hat linux and professional workstation to consumers through either value added resellers or distributors  decreased to million for the year ending february  from million for the year ended february  this decrease is due to our focus on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprises rather than on the consumer market 
this market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for us 
embedded subscription embedded subscription revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded subscription revenue is related to the expiration of support arrangements for semiconductor and telecommunication customers due to the weak performance of these industries in previous years that affected research and development spending

enterprise technology services revenue decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the decrease in enterprise technologies services revenue is primarily due to a decrease in the revenues earned from agreements with our oem partners of approximately million and a million decrease in consulting services related to services performed for large enterprise customers for the deployment of rhel 
these decreases were primarily offset by customer training and education services revenue which increased to million in year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is the direct result of the continued migration of larger enterprises to our rhel platform from a proprietary unix platform  increasing the need to train system administrators and developers 
embedded services embedded services revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the increase in embedded markets is due to the improvement in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has positively impacted research and development spending 
cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue the cost of enterprise technologies and retail subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to manufacture  package  distribute and support our solutions 
these costs include expenses for physical media  literature and packaging  fulfillment and shipping  labor related costs to provide technical support and maintenance of which the largest component is labor cost

the decrease in amortization of intangibles expense was due to previously capitalized costs being fully amortized 
subsequent event on march   we announced that our board of directors authorized the expansion of our september stock repurchase program 
under the expanded program  we are authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of million  or an additional million from the previously authorized september stock repurchase program  of our common stock  par value 
per share  and up to million of our convertible senior debentures due from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  as applicable 
this expanded program will expire on the earlier of i march   or ii a determination by the board of directors  the chief executive officer or chief financial officer to discontinue the program 
acquisitions acquisition of netscape security solutions on december   we completed the purchase of the netscape security solutions unit from netscape communications corporation and america online  inc for a purchase price of million in cash 
an additional million was payable by red hat contingent on certain future customer orders being placed on or before april  this payout is expected to occur and will increase the amount of goodwill recorded 
the assets acquired include a directory server and certificate management system 
acquisition of sistina software  inc in december  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of sistina software  inc sistina in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock and the assumption of all of the outstanding sistina stock options valued  in the aggregate  at million 
the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in the transaction were million and million  respectively 
the excess of purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired of million has been recorded as goodwill 
in addition  the transaction includes million of contingent consideration based on an earn out structured in three tranches 
the earn out is based on the achievement of certain bookings targets for the technologies and services previously sold by sistina over the period beginning on december  and ending march  no contingent consideration was earned during the earn out period 
one of the keys to our business strategy is to receive increasing annual subscription revenues on a per system basis by providing additional value to our customers in the form of layers of technology that will be provided on top of our rhel operating system and through providing additional systems management services 
the products we acquired in these transactions provide us with complimentary technologies to our existing storage management offerings 
we completed these acquisitions in the last months and it is too early to assess the results of these acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings  and from cash flows from operations 
at february   we had total cash and investments of million  which is comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  fixed income investments and million of long term  fixed income investments 
at february   we had total cash and investments of million  which is comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  fixed income investments and million of long term  fixed income investments 
at february   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to february  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal resulted primarily from cash provided by operations of million and a total of million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of sales of debt securities  of million  purchase of treasury stock of million  acquisition of business of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and million of cash used to pay down capital lease obligations 
cash provided by operations of million in the year ended february   includes net income of million  adjusted to exclude the impact of non cash items totaling million and changes in working capital 
changes in working capital items were a net source of cash of million primarily resulting from an increase in deferred revenue of million 
the increase in deferred revenue is due to bookings growth and related billings to our customers for subscriptions to our technologies 
in the fiscal year ended february   cash provided by operations was million 
the significant improvement in our cash flow from operations in fiscal is a result of increased sales of subscriptions to rhel  which resulted in the million increase in deferred revenues  as well as from the million increase in net income 
we do not believe that there are collectibility or billing problems with our customers that have not been appropriately reserved at each balance sheet date 
in the fiscal year ended february   cash used in investing activities of million was comprised of the purchases of fixed income investments of million  proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities of million  purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software  hardware and computer networking equipment totaling million  and acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired of million the acquisition of the assets of the former netscape security solutions unit from america online  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended february  was primarily comprised of million in purchases of treasury shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  and million in payments under capital lease obligations and debt financing costs  partially offset by a total of million in proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in january  we issued million in convertible senior debentures to the initial purchaser  a sophisticated  accredited investor with a pre existing relationship with us  in a private placement pursuant to section of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  and the debentures were resold by the initial purchaser to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act 
the debentures mature on january  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures which represents a conversion price of approximately per share subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  in cash at any time on or after january  holders of the debentures may require us to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  in cash on january of  and as of february   no debentures were redeemed 
accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption 
interest payments totaling million were made during the year ended february  accrued interest at february  was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at february   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million as compared to february  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal resulted primarily from the issuance of the convertible debentures in january  net of issuance of costs  of million  cash provided by operations of million  a total of million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  net cash acquired in the acquisition of sistina of million  and million in employee income taxes withheld from the exercise of common stock options in february which were disbursed in march these sources of cash were offset by the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of sales of debt securities  of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  primarily related to the re implemenation of our oracle instance  million of cash  net  used to pay down our line of credit and million of cash used to pay down capital lease obligations 
cash provided by operations of million in the year ended february   represented the net income of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and net non cash charges of million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  including intangibles  of million 
the increase in accounts receivable and deferred revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of subscriptions sold of rhel technologies 
in the fiscal year ended february   cash used in operations was  the significant improvement in our cash flow from operations in fiscal is a result of increased sales of subscriptions to rhel  which resulted in the million increase in deferred revenues  as well as management s continued focus on improved operating profits and preserving our cash balance 
we do not believe that there are any collectibility or billing problems with our customers that have not been appropriately reserved at each balance sheet date 
cash used in investing activities of million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of maturities  of million  purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software  hardware and computer networking equipment totaling million  offset by million  net  of cash acquired in the acquisition of sistina in late december the significant majority of the purchases of investments occurred as a result of the investment of a portion of the approximately million in net proceeds received from the completion of the convertible debenture offering in january cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended february  was comprised of million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior debentures in january  million in employee income taxes withheld from the exercise of common stock options in february which were remitted to taxing authorities in march and million  combined  in proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million of repayments  net of borrowings  made against our line of credit and million in payments under capital lease obligations 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our rhel technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to funding the development of our rhel products accelerating the development of our systems management services  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  and making possible investments in businesses  products and technologies 
we have made substantial progress in improving cash flow from operations 
in fiscal  we used million  to fund our operations 
in fiscal  we generated million in cash from our operations  more than in any other fiscal year of our operating history 
our cash flow provided by operations for fiscal  increased by million compared to fiscal due to the continued increased demand for our products and services  which also affords us leverage in negotiating up front payments for subscriptions from customers  and the increase in the number of subscriptions sold for rhel in fiscal as compared to fiscal given the significant improvement in operating cash flow and the million of cash and investments held at february   we do not anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will maintain or improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at february  in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations convertible debentures total recent accounting pronouncements see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors risks related to our business if open source software programmers  most of whom we do not employ  do not continue to develop and enhance open source technologies  we may be unable to develop new products or adequately enhance our existing products 
we rely to a significant degree on several largely informal communities of independent open source software programmers to develop and enhance our products 
for example  linus torvalds  a prominent open source software developer  and a relatively small group of software engineers  many of whom are not employed by us  are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel  which is the heart of the rhel operating system 
if these groups of programmers fail to adequately further develop and enhance open source technologies  we would have to rely on other parties to develop and enhance our products or we would need to develop and enhance our products with our own resources 
we cannot predict whether further developments and enhancements to these technologies would be available from reliable alternative sources 
in either event  our development expenses could be increased and our product release and upgrade schedules could be delayed 
moreover  if third party software programmers fail to adequately further develop and enhance open source technologies  the development and adoption of these technologies could be stifled and our products could become less competitive 
if we fail to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading companies  we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base 
our success depends in part on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading hardware manufacturers such as hewlett packard  dell  ibm  fujitsu and others  distributors  software vendors such as oracle and enterprise solutions providers 
these relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
we may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms 
in addition  our existing strategic relationships do not  and any future strategic relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
as a result  many of the companies with which we have strategic alliances pursue alternative technologies and develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services  either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing  and technical support 
if third party enterprise software application providers do not continue to make their applications compatible with our linux based operating system offerings  our software will cease to be competitive 
our products will not be competitive unless enterprise software applications are compatible with our linux based operating system offerings 
we intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on both current and new versions of our linux based operating systems by  among other means  attracting third party developers to the linux platform  providing open source tools to create these applications and maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support 
if we are not successful in achieving these goals  however  our products will not be competitive and our sales growth will be adversely affected 
we may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development  which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation 
we do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology 
different groups of open source software programmers compete with one another to develop new technology 
typically  the technology developed by one group will become more widely used than that developed by others 
if we acquire or adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products but competing technology becomes more widely used or accepted  the market appeal of our products may be reduced and that could harm our reputation  diminish the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
because of characteristics of open source software  there are few technology barriers to entry in the open source market by new competitors and it may be relatively easy for new competitors with greater resources than us to enter our markets and compete with us 
one of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone can modify the existing software or develop new software that competes with existing open source software 
such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies 
it is possible for a new competitor with greater resources than ours to develop its own open source solutions  potentially reducing the demand for our solutions 
we have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions  which may be difficult to complete  integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and  in the future  may enter into business combinations and acquisitions 
for example  on december   we acquired certain assets from america online  inc s netscape security solutions unit 
we have limited experience in making acquisitions  and acquisitions present significant challenges and risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel  the inability to maintain a relationship with customers of the acquired business  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services  the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition  expenses related to the acquisition  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses  and unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology 
there can be no assurance that we will manage these challenges and risks successfully 
moreover  if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we have or may pursue  our business strategy may be adversely affected  and we may incur substantial expenses and divert significant management time and resources 
in addition  in pursuing such acquisitions  we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price 
we could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions  which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution  or incur substantial debt 
any acquisition may not generate additional revenue or profit for us 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years 
for example  our total revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended february  to approximately million for the year ended february  moreover  the total number of our employees has been steadily increasing over at least the last four quarters 
in addition  we continue to explore ways to extend our product and service offerings  and geographic reach 
our growth has placed and may continue to place a strain on our management systems  information systems  resources and internal controls 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan requires adequate information systems and resources and oversight from our senior management 
we have  with our audit committee  undertaken to review and improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will need to continue to modify and improve these controls  systems and procedures and other internal controls and compliance procedures as we continue to grow and expand our business 
as we grow  we must also continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not be able to hire  or adequately train  supervise and manage sufficient personnel or develop management and operating systems to adequately manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to adequately manage our growth and improve our controls  systems and procedures  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
we rely  to a significant degree  on an indirect sales channel for distribution of our products and services  and disruption of any part of this channel could adversely affect the sales of our products 
we use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services  including indirect channel partners  such as third party oems  resellers and distributors 
a number of these partners in turn distribute via their own networks of channel partners eg  distributors and resellers  with whom we have no direct relationship 
we rely  to a significant degree  on our channel partners 
our indirect distribution channel could be affected by disruptions in the relationships of and with our channel partners and their networks  including with their customers or suppliers 
we cannot guarantee that our channel partners will market our products effectively 
disruptions in our distribution channel or poor marketing support by channel partners could lead to decreased sales or slower than expected growth 
security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose clients our security measures may not prevent security breaches that could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users provide us with credit card and other confidential information and authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products and services 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of this confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer data 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation or financial condition and  therefore  our business 
in addition  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could  among other effects  misappropriate proprietary information  cause interruptions in our operations or expose customers to computer viruses 
we are vulnerable to system failures  which could harm our business 
we rely on our technology infrastructure to sell our products and services and to fulfill orders 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events 
the majority of our systems are not redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  such problems could result in interruptions in our services  which could harm our reputation and financial condition 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
any interruption in the availability of our websites would create a large volume of user questions and complaints that would need to be addressed by our customer support personnel rather than by self help additionally  any unscheduled interruption in our services would likely result in a loss of revenues and could cause some users to switch to our competitors 
risks related to legal uncertainty we could be prevented from selling or developing our software if the gnu general public license and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable 
a number of our offerings  including rhel  have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar open source licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
the gnu general public license is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing all or a portion of our products 
our subscription based contract model may encounter customer resistance 
the subscription agreement used for many of our products  including rhel  requires customers to agree to a subscription for our services for each machine on which they deploy our subscription based products 
at the same time  the subscription agreement places no restriction on the customer s right to redistribute the products 
while we believe this practice complies with the requirements of the gnu general public license  and while we have reviewed this practice with the free software foundation  the organization that maintains and provides interpretations of the gnu general public license  we may still encounter customer resistance to this distribution model 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in promoting or defending this distribution model  our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if our products are found to infringe third party intellectual property rights  we could be required to redesign our products  replace components of our products or enter into license agreements with third parties 
we have committed to our customers with valid  registered enterprise subscriptions that if any portion of our enterprise products are found to infringe any third party intellectual property rights we will  at our expense and option i obtain the right for the customer to continue to use the product consistent with their subscription agreement with us  ii modify the product so that it is non infringing  or iii replace the infringing component with a non infringing component 
although we cannot predict whether we will need to satisfy this commitment  satisfying the commitment could be costly and time consuming and could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately cover our exposure to this type of claim 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of software components  many of which are developed by numerous independent parties  and an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights including trade secrets because our products are comprised of software components  many of which are developed by numerous independent parties 
claims for infringement of intellectual property rights may be filed and may seek damages and injunctive relief 
the risk of infringement claims is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
it is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications 
claims of infringement could require us to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  reengineer our products  or discontinue the sale of our products in the event that obtaining licenses and reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely and cost effective basis 
sco group  inc  or sco  has publicly alleged that certain linux kernels contain unauthorized unix code or derivative works 
on november   we filed a complaint against sco in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that we are not infringing any of sco s intellectual property rights 
sco  to date  has not asserted a claim of infringement against us 
uncertainty concerning sco s allegations  regardless of their merit  could adversely affect sales of our products 
if sco were to prevail in this or other actions related to their claims regarding linux  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
defending patent infringement  copyright infringement and or trade secret claims  even claims without significant merit  can be expensive 
an adverse legal decision regarding the intellectual property in and to our technology and other offerings could harm our business and may do so materially 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by ourselves and our customers  errors have been and will likely continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of linux based operating systems and other open source software products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system or other failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks 
the protective steps we have taken in the past have been  and may in the future continue to be  inadequate to protect  and deter misappropriation of  our trademark rights 
although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our trademark rights in a timely manner 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the americas  europe  asia and australia and have other trademark applications pending in each of those regions 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the red hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
in connection with our restatement of historical financial statements  class action lawsuits have been filed against us and additional lawsuits may be filed 
following our announcement in july of our intention to restate historical financial statements  class action lawsuits and three derivative lawsuits were commenced against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers  by or on behalf of persons claiming to be our stockholders and persons claiming to have purchased or otherwise acquired our securities at specified dates beginning as early as june  and continuing through july  the class action lawsuits have since been consolidated into a single lawsuit 
in addition  two of the three derivative suits have been consolidated into a single lawsuit as well 
additional lawsuits may be filed against us 
regardless of the outcome of any of these actions  it is likely that we will incur substantial defense costs and that such actions will cause a diversion of our management s time and attention 
if we do not prevail in these cases we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are unable at this time to assess the validity of the claims or estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
we have not yet established any financial reserves relating to any of these lawsuits 
we may suffer material adverse consequences if we are deemed to be an investment company and may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status 
we may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of the act  if we own investment securities with a value exceeding of our total assets  unless a particular exclusion or safe harbor provision applies 
a large portion of our assets has been invested in investment grade interest bearing securities  many of which constitute investment securities under the act 
as of february   our investment securities exceeded of our total assets 
we believe that we are excluded from the definition of investment company and the registration requirements of the act  but absent further interpretation by the courts or the sec of the relevant exclusions  this result cannot be assured 
investment companies are subject to registration under the act and compliance with a variety of restrictions and requirements imposed under the act 
if we were to be deemed an investment company  we would become subject to these restrictions and requirements of the act and the consequences of having been an investment company without registering thereunder  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
in addition  we may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status if an exclusion from the act were to be considered unavailable to us at a time when the value of our investments that constitute investment securities exceeds of our total assets 
if we were required to change the allocation of our assets to reduce our ownership of securities that constitute investment securities  and acquire non investment security assets  this could result in transaction costs and a reduction in the rate of return on our liquid assets 
risks related to our financial results and condition you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results 
due to the unpredictability of the technology spending environment  our revenue and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to protect our projected operating results for a quarter if our revenue in that quarter falls short of our expectations 
if among other considerations our future operating results fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors or we are unable to increase or maintain profitability  the market price of our common stock may decline 
we may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers  which could adversely affect revenue 
in late fiscal  we began to focus the predominant portion of our sales and marketing efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base 
to this end  we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers 
while we have had certain success to date in acquiring large enterprise customers  if we are unsuccessful in gaining additional large enterprise customers in the future or in securing subscription renewals from existing enterprise customers  it will adversely affect our future financial performance 
in addition  while our subscription agreements generally provide for renewals at prices that are the same as those in effect during the initial term or at then current list prices  there can be no assurance that customers will renew their subscription agreements at the end of the initial or any renewal term or that customers will not seek to condition any renewal on reduced prices 
any failure to obtain customer renewals  or reduction in prices upon renewal  could reduce future revenues 
we may not be able to continue to attract capable management personnel 
our ability to retain key management personnel or hire capable new management personnel as we grow may be challenged to the extent the technology sector performs well and or if companies with more generous compensation packages or greater perceived growth opportunities compete for the same personnel 
in addition  historically we have used stock options as a key component of our compensation packages 
changes in the accounting for equity compensation  including stock options  could adversely affect our earnings or force us to use more cash compensation to attract and retain capable personnel 
volatility in the stock market may reduce the value of our equity awards to the recipient 
such events may affect our ability to successfully attract and retain key management personnel 
we depend on our key personnel that we employ 
our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers and employees 
the loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any these individuals could seriously impede our success 
moreover  the loss of these individuals  particularly to a competitor  and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the red hat brand and adversely affect our business or stock price 
we may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively 
in the market for operating systems and applications  we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have 
competitors  which offer hardware independent multi user operating systems for intel platforms and or linux and unix based operating systems  include microsoft  novell  ibm  sun microsystems  hewlett packard and unisys 
we may lack the financial and operational resources needed to compete successfully with our current competitors as well as potential new competitors 
competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for our products and services  resulting in reduced profit margins and loss of market opportunity 
we may have to lower the prices of our products and services to stay competitive  which could affect our margins and financial condition 
in addition  if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive  we may lose market share 
industry consolidation may  also effect competition by creating larger and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
in the market for services offerings  we face significant competition from larger companies  including those that currently provide service and training related to the linux operating system as well as other operating systems  particularly unix based operating systems  due to the fact that linux and unix based operating systems share many common features 
these larger companies  including ibm  novell and hewlett packard  may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of consulting and training on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully with our current or potential competitors 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations  which represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended february   continue to expand 
our international operations accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended february  as we expand our international operations  we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business and we may need to reorganize our sales and technical support services forces  staff key management positions and successfully localize software products for a significant number of international markets  fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights overseas due among other reasons to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  export controls and times of crisis could prevent us from shipping our products into and out of certain markets  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and economic or political instability or terrorist acts in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our sales cycle makes financial planning and future financial results less predictable and our financial performance may not meet expectations if we are unable to accurately predict the effect of the sales cycle 
our quarterly sales have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of such quarters total sales occur toward the end of such quarter and this trend has had more of an impact on our financial results in recent periods 
this makes predicting our revenue  earnings and cash flows for each financial period more difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we experience some seasonal trends 
for example  european sales are often weaker during the summer months 
many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control and negatively impact our ability to accurately predict our sales cycle 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we do not have an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls or fail on an on going basis to properly address and implement section of sarbanes oxley 
we must comply  on an on going basis  with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  including those provisions that establish the requirements for both management and auditors of public companies with respect to reporting on internal control over financial reporting 
these requirements first became applicable to the company on february  the requirements and processes associated with section are relatively new and untested  and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken  and will take  will be sufficient or timely completed to meet the section requirements on an on going basis  or that we will be able to implement and maintain adequate disclosure controls and controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future  particularly in light of our rapid growth and international expansion  which is expected to result in on going changes to our control systems and areas of potential risk 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting  including satisfaction of the requirements of section of sox  we may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results or adequately identify and reduce fraud 
as a result  the financial position of our business could be harmed  current and potential future shareholders could lose confidence in the company and or our reported financial results  which may cause a negative effect on our trading price  and we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings  which may be costly or divert management attention 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in prevailing interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates will result in an million change in interest income on an annual basis 
our convertible debentures are at fixed rates and therefore interest expense is not impacted by a change in rates 
the fair market value of the debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the debentures will also increase as the market price of the red hat stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of february  and february   the fair value of the debentures was approximately million and million  respectively based on quoted market prices 
investment risk the fair market value of the investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on this investment portfolio  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities as of february  and february   respectively 
derivative instruments we did not hold derivative financial instruments as of february   and have not held these types of investments prior to that date 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenues for the fiscal year ended february  were produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  and revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occur 
translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity
