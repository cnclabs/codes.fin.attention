part i item business 
overview we are engaged primarily in the research and development of drug delivery technologies 
our primary focus at the present time is our proprietary technology for the administration of formulations of large molecule drugs to the oral buccal cavity using a hand held aerosol applicator 
a substantial number of large molecule drugs ie  drugs composed of molecules with a higher than specified molecular weight have been approved for sale in the united states or are presently undergoing clinical trials as part of the process to obtain such approval  including various proteins  peptides  monoclonal antibodies  hormones and vaccines 
unlike small molecule drugs  which generally can be administered by various methods  large molecule drugs historically have been administered predominately by injection 
the principal reasons for this have been the vulnerability of large molecule drugs to digestion and the relatively large size of the molecule itself  which makes absorption into the blood stream through the skin or mucosa inefficient or ineffective 
all injection therapies involve varying degrees of discomfort and inconvenience 
with chronic and sub chronic diseases  the discomfort and inconvenience associated with injection therapies frequently results in less than optimal patient acceptance of  and compliance with  the prescribed treatment plan 
poor acceptance and compliance can lead to medical complications and higher disease management costs 
also  elderly  infirm and pediatric patients with chronic or sub chronic conditions may not be able to self inject their medications 
in such cases  assistance is required which increases both the cost and inconvenience of the therapy 
our goal is to develop proprietary formulations of large molecule drugs that can be administered through the buccal mucosa  primarily the inner cheek walls  thereby eliminating or reducing the need for injections 
we believe that our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that has application to many large molecule drugs  and provides a convenient  non invasive  accurate and cost effective way to administer such drugs 
we have identified several large molecule drugs as possible candidates for development  but to date have focused our development efforts on a buccal insulin product 
our first product is an insulin formulation that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using a hand held aerosol spray applicator 
between january and september  we conducted limited clinical trials on this product in the united states  canada and europe 
in september  we entered into an agreement the development and license agreement to develop this product with eli lilly and company lilly 
to date  over  patients with diabetes have been dosed with our oral insulin product at approved facilities in seven countries 
we conducted several clinical trials with insulin supplied by lilly under our development and license agreement 
lilly did not  however  authorize or conduct any clinical trials or provide financial support for those trials 
we did receive a  upfront payment from lilly 
on may   we announced that we had agreed with lilly to end the development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of buccal delivery of insulin 
on november   we entered into a termination agreement with lilly terminating the development and license agreement  effective as of june  in accordance with the termination agreement  we retained all of the intellectual property and commercialization rights with respect to buccal spray drug delivery technology  and we have the continuing right to develop and commercialize the product 
we also entered into a bulk supply agreement the bulk supply agreement for the sale of human insulin crystals by lilly to us over a three year period 
the bulk supply agreement establishes purchase prices  minimum purchase requirements  maximum amounts which may be purchased in each year and a non refundable prepayment of  to be applied against amounts due for purchases 
in january  we established a joint venture with elan international services  ltd 
eis  a wholly owned subsidiary of elan corporation  plc eis and elan corporation  plc being collectively referred to as elan  to pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products  for the treatment of prostate cancer  endometriosis and or the suppression of testosterone and estrogen 
in january  we and elan agreed to expand the joint venture to encompass the buccal delivery of morphine for the treatment of pain and agreed to pursue buccal morphine as the initial pharmaceutical product for development under generex bermuda ltd  the entity through which the joint venture was being conducted 
this expansion of the joint venture occurred after we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical study of morphine delivery using our proprietary buccal delivery technology 
in connection with the joint venture  eis purchased  shares of our series a preferred stock for  which eis transferred  shortly thereafter  to elan pharmaceuticals investment iii  an affiliate of elan epil iii 
we applied the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock to subscribe for an equity ownership interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
eis paid in capital of  to subscribe for a equity ownership interest in the joint venture entity 
in accordance with the terms of the series a preferred stock  if any shares of series a preferred stock were to be outstanding on january   we would have been required to redeem the shares of series a preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the aggregate series a preferred stock liquidation preference  either in cash  or in shares of common stock with a fair market value equal to the redemption price 
alternatively  the series a preferred stock could have been converted  under certain conditions  into shares of our common stock 
eis also purchased  shares of our common stock for  we were permitted to use the proceeds of this sale for any corporate purpose 
on december   we entered into an agreement the termination agreement with elan  whereby we and elan agreed to terminate the joint venture through generex bermuda ltd 
pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement  i except for a common stock purchase warrant that was issued by us to elan  which was amended to permit elan or any other holder thereof to transfer the warrant without our consent  the parties agreed to terminate all agreements entered into in connection with the joint venture  and ii elan agreed to transfer all shares of capital stock of generex bermuda owned by it to us 
accordingly  all rights granted by each party to the other terminated  including  without limitation  elan s right to appoint a member to our board of directors  all other rights granted under the terms of the joint venture terminated  each party retained its intellectual property rights  we obtained full ownership of generex bermuda  and all representatives of elan who were officers and or directors of generex bermuda resigned 
in connection with negotiating the termination agreement  epil iii approached us for consent to transfer the series a preferred stock by way of an auction process 
although we provided our consent to the transfer  it was contingent upon epil iii agreeing to satisfy the following conditions i the auction process could conclude no later than december  and epil iii s disposition of the shares could conclude no later than december  the closing date  ii the buyer had to immediately convert the series a preferred stock at the voluntary conversion price of calculated pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock  iii epil iii s registration rights could not be transferred  and iv for a period of two years after the closing date  the purchaser of the series a preferred stock could not transfer the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof and we would have the right to redeem the shares of common stock at a per share price of of the average closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market for the twenty days immediately preceding the closing date 
on or about december   epil iii conducted the auction and received an offer to buy the shares of series a preferred stock 
on or about december   epil iii sold the shares of series a preferred stock  and the purchaser thereof immediately converted the series a preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
the conversion of the series a preferred stock was particularly critical because the mandatory redemption feature required us to classify the series a preferred stock as approximately  of mezzanine equity 
upon conversion of the series a preferred stock  however  we were able to reclassify the approximately  of mezzanine equity as common equity on our balance sheet 
this  in turn  allowed us to regain compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule c b  which requires us to have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
in august  we acquired antigen express  inc antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
our immunomedicine products work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents ie  cancer cells  bacteria  and viruses or to stop attacking benign elements ie  self proteins and allergens 
our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies that were discovered by an executive officer of antigen  the ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression 
the immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development except for a current phase clinical trial in human patients with stage ii her neu positive breast cancer 
development efforts are underway in melanoma  prostate cancer  hiv  influenza virus  smallpox  sars and type i diabetes mellitus 
we are seeking to establish collaborations with clinical investigators at academic centers to advance the technology 
with the anticipated launch of commercial sales of our oral insulin product in ecuador in  we expect to receive revenues from product sales in the fiscal year ending july  we do not expect this revenue to be sufficient for all of our cash needs during the year 
in the past we were able to fund antigen expenses with some revenue from research grants for antigen s immunomedicine products 
during the fiscal year ended july   we received a total of  in such research grants  and we have received a total of  in such research grants 
we do not expect to receive such grants on the going forward basis 
we expect to satisfy the majority of our cash needs during the current year from capital raised through equity financings 
we are a development stage company  and from inception through the end of the fiscal year had not received any revenues from operations other than the up front payment from lilly 
we have begun the regulatory approval process for only three products  our oral insulin formulation  morphine and fentanyl 
we have only one product  our oral insulin formulation  that has been approved for commercial marketing and sale by drug regulatory authorities  and that approval was obtained in ecuador in early may we believe that our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that has application to a large number of large molecule drugs in addition to insulin 
estrogen  heparin  monoclonal antibodies  human growth hormone  fertility hormone  as well as a number of vaccines are among the compounds that we have identified as possible candidates for product development 
buccal delivery technology our buccal delivery technology involves the preparation of a proprietary formulation in which an active pharmaceutical agent is placed in a solution with a combination of absorption enhancers and other excipients classified generally recognized as safe gras by the united states food and drug administration the fda when used in accordance with specified quantity and other limitations 
the resulting formulation is aerosolized with a pharmaceutical grade chemical propellant and is administered to the patient using our proprietary rapidmist device 
the device is a small  lightweight  hand held  easy to use aerosol applicator comprised of a container for the formulation  a metered dose valve  an actuator and dust cap 
using the device  the patient self administers the formulation by spraying it into the mouth 
the device contains multiple applications  the number being dependent  among other things  on the concentration of the formulation 
absorption of the pharmaceutical agent occurs in the buccal cavity  principally through the inner cheek walls 
in clinical studies of our insulin product oral lyn  insulin absorption in the buccal cavity has been shown to be very efficacious 
we are also evaluating the use of our rapidmist device for the delivery of both morphine and fentanyl 
buccal insulin product insulin is a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas to regulate the level of glucose  a type of sugar  in the bloodstream 
the term diabetes refers to a group of disorders that are characterized by the inability of the body to properly regulate blood glucose levels 
when glucose is abundant  it is converted into fat and stored for use when food is not available 
when glucose is not available from food  these fats are broken down into free fatty acids that stimulate glucose production 
insulin acts by stimulating the use of glucose as fuel and by inhibiting the production of glucose 
in a healthy individual  a balance is maintained between insulin secretion and glucose metabolism 
there are two major types of diabetes 
type diabetes juvenile onset diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes refers to the condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin 
type diabetes accounts for percent of diabetes cases 
it often occurs in children and young adults 
type diabetics must take daily insulin injections  typically three to five times per day  to regulate blood glucose levels 
in type diabetes adult onset or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  the body does not produce enough insulin  or cannot properly use the insulin produced 
type diabetes is the most common form of the disease and accounts for percent of diabetes cases 
in addition to insulin therapy  type diabetics may take oral drugs that stimulate the production of insulin by the pancreas or that help the body to more effectively use insulin 
if not treated  diabetes can lead to blindness  kidney disease  nerve disease  amputation  heart disease and stroke 
each year  between  and  people lose their sight because of diabetes 
diabetes is also the leading cause of end stage renal disease kidney failure  accounting for about of new cases 
in addition  about percent of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of diabetic nerve damage  which  in severe forms  can lead to lower limb amputations 
diabetics are also to times more likely to have heart disease  which is present in percent of diabetes related deaths  and are to times more likely to suffer a stroke 
there is no known cure for diabetes 
the world health organization estimates that there are currently over billion diabetics worldwide 
it is further estimated that this number will almost double by the year there are estimated to be million people suffering from diabetes in north america alone  approximately million of whom are undiagnosed  and diabetes is the second largest cause of death by disease in north america 
we conducted the first clinical trials of our buccal insulin formulation with human subjects in ecuador in january we ultimately conducted a number of studies in ecuador in  each of which involved a selection of between and patients 
the principal purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effectiveness of our oral insulin formulation in humans compared with injected insulin and placebos 
in march  we entered into a letter of intent for the establishment of a joint venture with pharmabrand sa  a distributor of pharmaceutical products in central and latin america 
in august  we sought approval for the manufacturing  marketing  distribution and sale of oral lyn and the rapidmist diabetes management system from the ecuador ministry of public health 
in may  we received approval from the ecuadorian ministry of public health for the commercial marketing and sale of oral lyn for treatment of type and type diabetes 
pharmabrand is making preparations for the commercial launch of oral lyn in ecuador  and we are continuing our efforts to secure the participation of a multi national pharmaceutical co marketing partner for the balance of south america 
on the basis of the test results in ecuador and other pre clinical data  we made an investigatory new drug submission to the health protection branch in canada canada s equivalent to the fda in july  and received permission from the canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in september we filed an investigational new drug application with the fda in october  and received fda approval to proceed with human trials in november annual reports have been filed with the fda each year since that time 
we began our clinical trial programs in canada and the united states in january between january and september  we conducted clinical trials of our insulin formulation involving approximately type and type diabetic patients and healthy volunteers 
the study protocol in most trials involved administration of two different doses of our insulin formulation following either a liquid sustacal meal or a standard meal challenge 
the objective of these studies was to evaluate our insulin formulation s efficacy in controlling post prandial meal related glucose levels 
these trials demonstrated that our insulin formulation controlled post prandial hyperglycemia in a manner comparable to injected insulin 
in april  a phase ii b clinical trial protocol was approved in canada 
thereafter  a pilot trial was successfully undertaken in ecuador the results of which have been reported at several scientific symposia to optimize the oral insulin formulation to transition to phase iii clinical trials 
we are currently in the process of finalizing our submission to canadian health authorities for the approval of initiation of phase iii trials 
we anticipate being in a position to commence phase iii clinical trials of oral lyn tm in europe and canada subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals pursuant to meetings we anticipate being held before the end of the second calendar quarter of we continue to conduct limited clinical studies and seek additional collaborative partners in the united states  and other countries 
other large molecule drug projects we have identified numerous compounds  other than insulin  as candidates for product development 
morphine and fentanyl the delivery of morphine and fentanyl by oral formulation pills and injection for the treatment of moderate to severe breakthrough and postoperative pain often fails to provide patients with adequate relief and control breakthrough and postoperative pain are characterized as being moderate to severe in intensity  having a rapid onset of action and a short to medium duration 
not only does delivery by pills have a slow onset of action  it is often difficult for patients to adjust their doses  with the result that patients are either over or under medicated 
injections are invasive and require an attendant to administer the medication which reduces the patient s control over the pain and may cause increased anxiety 
often  patients must wait in pain until an attendant can medicate them 
we seek to develop a buccal delivery formulation for morphine and fentanyl that will have a critical series of attributes well suited for the treatment of breakthrough and post operative pain and which will be cost effective and will have a demonstrable improvement over current delivery methods 
these include fast access to the circulatory system  precise dosing control and a simple  self administration procedure 
we made an investigatory new drug submission for buccal morphine to the health protection branch in canada in january  and received permission from the canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in march we made an investigatory new drug submission for fentanyl to the health protection branch in canada in august  and received permission from the canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in october during fiscal year ended july   we did not actively pursue our buccal morphine and buccal fentanyl projects 
other products we have had discussions of possible research collaborations with various pharmaceutical companies concerning use of our large molecule drug delivery technology with insulin  morphine  fentanyl and other compounds  including monoclonal antibodies  human growth hormone  fertility hormone  estrogen and heparin  and a number of vaccines 
we have also developed a proprietary formulated glucose spray  gluco gyn  for the treatment of hypoglycemia in people with diabetes 
gluco gyn works quickly to raise blood sugar  has no side effects  and is effective to counteract the effects of low blood sugar or insulin reaction 
we have not aggressively pursued development opportunities apart from insulin because we believe it is more advantageous to concentrate our resources  particularly our financial resources  on developing the insulin product 
while the insulin product remains our first priority  we continue developmental work for buccal delivery formulation for morphine and fentanyl 
immunomedicine technology and products our new subsidiary  antigen  is engaged in research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
our immunomedicine products work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents ie  cancer cells  bacteria  and viruses or to stop attacking benign elements ie  self proteins and allergens 
our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies that were discovered by an executive officer of antigen  the ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression 
these technologies are expected to greatly boost immune cell responses which treat the ailments and conditions 
we have not filed an investigational new drug application to begin clinical trials other than a physician s investigational new drug application for a phase trial in human patients with stage ii her neu positive breast cancer 
other than the breast cancer trial  our immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development and trials in human patients are not expected for at least six months 
corporate history we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
p 
s  inc  a previously inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our shareholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gb delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
in august  we acquired antigen express  inc antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
government regulation our research and development activities  and the eventual manufacturing and marketing of our products  are subject to extensive regulation by the food and drug administration in the united states the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries 
among other things  extensive regulation puts a burden on our ability to bring products to market 
while these regulations apply to all competitors in our industry  many of our competitors have more experience in dealing with the fda and other regulators 
also  other companies in our industry are not limited primarily to products which still need to be approved by government regulators  as we are now 
if requisite regulatory approvals are not obtained and maintained  our business will be substantially harmed 
in many if not all cases  we expect that our development partners will participate extensively in the regulatory approval process once a development agreement is in place 
the following discussion summarizes the principal features of food and drug regulation in the united states and other countries as they affect our business 
united states all aspects of our research  development and foreseeable commercial activities are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states 
united states federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the regulatory approval process  including clinical trials  usually takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include preclinical tests  the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  which must become effective before human clinical trials commence  human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of a new drug application to the fda  and fda approval of the new drug application  including approval of all product labeling and advertising 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product 
the results of the pre clinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of the investigational new drug application and are reviewed by the fda before the commencement of human clinical trials 
unless the fda objects to the investigational new drug application  the investigational new drug application becomes effective days following its receipt by the fda 
the investigational new drug application for our oral insulin formulation became effective in november we filed an investigational new drug application for buccal morphine in january clinical trials involve the administration of the new drug to humans under the supervision of a qualified investigator 
the protocols for the trials must be submitted to the fda as part of the investigational new drug application 
also  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board  which considers  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects  and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases phase i  phase ii  and phase iii  but the phases may overlap 
phase i clinical trials test the drug on healthy human subjects for safety and other aspects  but not effectiveness 
phase ii clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the drug for specific purposes  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosages  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a compound has shown evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety in phase ii evaluations  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at clinical trial sites in different geographical locations 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of therapeutic product candidates be supported through at least two adequate and well controlled phase iii clinical trials 
the successful completion of phase iii clinical trials is the precursor to the receipt of the approval of regulatory authorities for the manufacturing  marketing  and sale of products 
in the united states  the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  if successful  are submitted to the fda in a new drug application to seek approval to market and commercialize the drug product for a specified use 
the fda may deny a new drug application if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
the fda also may require additional testing for safety and efficacy of the drug 
we cannot be sure that any of our proposed products will receive the fda approval 
even if approved by the fda  our products and the facilities used to manufacture our products will remain subject to review and periodic inspection by the fda 
to supply drug products for use in the united states  foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
manufacturing facilities must also comply with the fda s good manufacturing practices  and such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda 
products manufactured outside the united states are inspected by regulatory authorities in those countries under agreements with the fda 
to comply with good manufacturing practices  manufacturers must expend substantial funds  time and effort in the area of production and quality control 
the fda stringently applies its regulatory standards for manufacturing 
discovery of previously unknown problems with respect to a product  manufacturer or facility may result in consequences with commercial significance 
these include restrictions on the product  manufacturer or facility  suspensions of regulatory approvals  operating restrictions  delays in obtaining new product approvals  withdrawals of the product from the market  product recalls  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
foreign countries before we are permitted to market any of our products outside of the united states  those products will be subject to regulatory approval by foreign government agencies similar to the fda 
these requirements vary widely from country to country 
generally  however  no action can be taken to market any drug product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country 
although an important consideration  fda approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities 
the current approval process varies from country to country  and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for fda approval 
the canadian regulatory process is substantially similar to that of the united states 
we obtained regulatory approval to begin clinical trials of our oral insulin formulation in canada in november we obtained regulatory approval to begin clinical trials of our buccal morphine product in canada in march in april  we received approval of an oral lyn phase ii b clinical trial protocol in canada 
we received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials of our fentanyl product in canada in october in may  we received approval from the ecuadorian ministry of public health for the commercial marketing and sale of oral lyn for treatment of type and type diabetes 
marketing we intend to rely on contracting or collaborative arrangements with one or more other companies that possess strong pharmaceutical marketing and distribution resources to perform these functions for us 
accordingly  we may not have the same control over marketing and distribution that we would have if we conducted these functions ourselves 
pharmabrand  our joint venture partner  is making preparations for the commercial launch of oral lyn tm in ecuador  and we are continuing our efforts to secure the participation of a multi national pharmaceutical co marketing partner in the commercial launch of oral lyn tm in the balance of south america 
except for these arrangements  we do not have any agreements with any other companies for marketing or distributing our products 
with respect to our insulin product  we possess the worldwide marketing rights to this product after they reverted to us upon the termination in june of the development and license agreement with lilly 
manufacturing to date  we have produced our oral insulin formulation only on a small scale 
in december  we completed our pilot manufacturing facility in toronto in the same commercial complex in which our original laboratory is located 
we believe that this facility will be capable of producing our insulin product at levels necessary to supply our needs for late stage human clinical trials of the product and for initial commercial sales outside the united states 
we will need to significantly increase our manufacturing capability in order to manufacture any product in significant commercial quantities 
we plan to establish a manufacturing facility in ecuador for the purposes of commercial supply and sales in that country and  as we procure other registrations  in other south american markets 
our subsidiary antigen leases office and laboratory space in worcester  massachusetts  which is sufficient for its present needs 
the laboratory is approximately square feet and has permission to store and use biohazardous including recombinant dna materials and flammable chemicals 
raw material supplies the excipients used in our formulation are available from numerous sources in sufficient quantities for clinical purposes  and we believe that they will be available in sufficient quantities for commercial purposes when required  although we have not yet attempted to secure a commercial supply of any such products 
components suitable for our rapidmist device are available from a limited number of potential suppliers  as is the chemical propellant used in the device 
the components which now comprise the device will be utilized with the commercial version of our insulin product in ecuador and other south american countries 
we also expect to use the rapidmist device in connection with our buccal morphine and fentanyl products 
we have also secured supply arrangements with the manufacturers of all other components and the propellant that we presently use in our rapidmist device for commercial quantities of such components and the propellant 
all such suppliers are prominent  reputable and reliable suppliers to the pharmaceutical industry 
because we now have a single supplier for each of these components and propellant  however  we are more vulnerable to supply interruptions than would be the case if we had multiple suppliers for each component 
we do not believe that the risk of a single source of supply for proprietary raw materials or device components is unusual in the pharmaceutical industry 
insulin is available worldwide from only a few sources 
however  alternative supplies of insulin are under development in europe 
upon termination in june of our license agreement with lilly  we entered into a bulk supply agreement with lilly  pursuant to which lilly has been contracted to provide us with human insulin crystals over a three year period for clinical development purposes 
we also believe future development and marketing partners under licensing and development agreements  if any  will provide  or assist us to obtain  pharmaceutical compounds that are used in products covered under such agreements 
while morphine is a controlled substance  it is readily available for use in clinical trials 
we currently have the appropriate licenses and facilities for acquiring and storing morphine in canada 
various regulatory issues surround the import of morphine into the united states  and we will need to address these issues prior to commencing clinical trials in the united states 
raw materials for our pre clinical development stage immunomedicine products include amino acids for peptide therapeutics and oligonucleotides for genetic constructs 
these materials are readily available from commercial suppliers 
we utilize the services of several commercial laboratories for the manufacturing of our pre clinical development stage immunomedicine products 
intellectual property we currently have seventeen issued us patents and four pending us patent applications one of which as been allowed pertaining to aspects of buccal delivery technology including oral administration of macromolecular formulations including insulin as well as pain relief medications eg morphine  fentanyl 
we currently hold two issued canadian patents and eleven pending canadian patent applications also relating to aspects of buccal drug delivery technology 
we also hold forty nine issued patents and forty two pending patent applications covering our drug delivery technology in jurisdictions other than the us and canada 
in addition  we have three issued canadian patents and two pending us patent applications pertaining to delivery technologies other than our buccal delivery technology 
we also have an indirect interest in three drug delivery patents held by another company  centrum biotechnologies  inc our subsidiary antigen currently holds six issued us patents  two australian patents  and a number of pending us and foreign patent applications concerning technology for modulating the immune system via activation of antigen specific helper t lymphocytes 
some of these patents are held under exclusive licenses from the university of massachusetts 
dr 
humphreys and dr 
xu  officers of antigen  are the listed inventors or co inventors on all of these patents and patent applications  including those licensed from the university of massachusetts 
our long term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement  misappropriation  discovery and duplication 
we cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted  or that any patents which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position 
our patent rights  and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general  are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues 
we believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe any one else s patent rights 
we believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies 
we cannot be sure of this  however  because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues 
see part i item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain legal proceedings involving intellectual property issues 
we also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information 
we seek to protect this information  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
competition we expect that products based upon our buccal delivery technology and any other products that we may develop will compete directly with products developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  government agencies and public and private research organizations 
products developed by our competitors may use a different active pharmaceutical agent or treatment to treat the same medical condition or indication as our product or may provide for the delivery of substantially the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products using different methods of administration 
for example  a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in various stages of research  development and testing of alternatives to insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes  as well as new methods of delivering insulin 
these methods  including nasal  transdermal  needle free high pressure injection and pulmonary  may ultimately successfully deliver insulin to diabetic patients 
some biotechnology companies also have developed different technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific research and product development capabilities  as well as financial  marketing and human resources  than we do 
where the same or substantially the same active ingredient is available using alternative delivery means or the same or substantially the same result is achievable with a different treatment or technology  we expect that competition among products will be based  among other things  on product safety  efficacy  ease of use  availability  price  marketing and distribution 
when different active pharmaceutical ingredients are involved  these same competitive factors will apply to both the active agent and the delivery method 
we consider other drug delivery and biotechnology companies to be direct competitors for the cooperation and support of major drug and biotechnology companies that own or market proprietary pharmaceutical compounds and technologies  as well as for the ultimate patient market 
of primary concern to us are the competitor companies that are known to be developing delivery systems for insulin and other pharmaceutical agents that we have identified as product candidates and technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens 
buccal insulin product nektar therapeutics  formerly inhale therapeutic systems  inc nektar  is developing a customized insulin formulation that is processed into a fine  dry powder and administered to the deep lung using a proprietary inhalation device developed for this purpose 
nektar is developing its insulin product in collaboration with pfizer  inc and the sanofi aventis group  the world s third largest pharmaceutical company 
on september   pfizer inc and the sanofi aventis group announced that a fda advisory committee panel has recommended the approval of exubera  an inhaleable  dry powder insulin developed in conjunction with nektar  for the treatment of adults with type and type diabetes 
nektar also is developing pulmonary products with large molecule drugs other than insulin and has stated that it is investigating the use of its inhalation technology with small molecule drugs 
aradigm corporation aradigm  which has announced a joint development agreement with novo nordisk a s to jointly develop a pulmonary delivery system for insulin by inhalation  also may be considered a direct competitor of ours in the insulin area 
novo nordisk is one of the two leading manufacturers of insulin in the world  the other being lilly 
aradigm and novo nordisk initiated phase iii clinical trials in september in april  novo nordisk announced results from a planned interim analysis of the initial phase iii trial and has decided to amend the current trial protocol 
novo nordisk will make decisions concerning the structure and timing of additional clinical trials after these observations have been fully assessed 
other companies have announced development efforts relating to non injection methods of delivering insulin or other large molecule drugs  including alkermes pharmaceuticals  inc  which announced a collaboration with lilly in april to develop a pulmonary method of administering insulin and is currently conducting phase iii clinical trials 
mannkind corporation is developing an inhaled insulin product named technosphere insulin  which is currently conducting phase iii clinical trials in the united states and in europe 
there are also a number of companies developing alternative means of delivering insulin in the form of oral pills  transdermal patches  and intranasal methods  which are at early stages of development 
in addition to other delivery systems for insulin  there are numerous products which have been approved for use in the treatment of type diabetics in substitution of  or in addition to  insulin therapy 
these products may also be considered competitive with insulin products 
buccal morphine and fentanyl products cephalon  inc currently markets actiq in the united states and has recently acquired the rights to the product in europe 
actiq delivers buccal transmucosal fentanyl to the cheek walls through the use of a lollipop 
on november   the fda cleared actiq for marketing for use in the management of breakthrough cancer pain 
the product was launched in march in the united states 
aradigm is developing the hand held aerx pain management system for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain 
the aerx pain management system is a pulmonary delivery system to deliver the drug through inhalation 
aerx has distinct advantages over the administration by injection of morphine and similar opiate derived pain control drugs 
aradigm is in progress to complete both phase i and ii clinical trials of these formulations 
nastech pharmaceuticals is developing an intranasal formulation of morphine that is in phase ii clinical trials 
results reported to date show the product to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of episodes of breakthrough pain 
nastech is currently seeking a licensing partner for this product 
immunomedicine technology and products a number of companies that are engaged in the development of immunomedicines employ technologies that are competitive to our subsidiary antigen 
zycos inc has developed the biotope technology  cel sci corporation has developed the leaps delivery technology  and epimmune inc has developed the padre technology 
these companies have initiated early stage clinical trials for several products for the treatment of cancer  autoimmune  and allergic diseases 
these companies also have established collaborations with academic centers and other companies for the development of certain products 
we have not initiated clinical trials with any of our immunomedicine products  nor have we established commercial collaborations to date 
environmental compliance our manufacturing  research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
we believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with all applicable government regulations 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if an accident occurred  we could be held liable for damages  and these damages could severely impact our financial condition 
we are also subject to many environmental  health and workplace safety laws and regulations  particularly those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens  and the handling of hazardous biological materials 
violations and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us 
however  we do not believe that compliance with the united states  canadian or other environmental laws will have a material effect on us in the foreseeable future 
research and development expenditures a substantial portion of our activities to date have been in research and development 
in the period from inception to july   our expenditures on research and development were  these included  in the year ended july    in the year ended july  and  in the year ended july  the decrease in our research and development activities in compared to is due primarily to reduction of our level of research and development activities  offset by increased activities of antigen and regulatory consultants 
the increase in our research and development expenses in compared to was due principally to activities of antigen and our increased development of oral insulin formulation compared to the prior year  including the purchase of bulk insulin 
financial information about geographic areas the regions in which we had identifiable assets and revenues and the amounts of such identifiable assets and revenues for each of the last three fiscal years are presented note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 
financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
identifiable assets are those that can be directly associated with a geographic area 
employees at september   we had twenty one full time employees  including our executive officers and other individuals who work for us full time but are employed by management companies that provide their services  and ten employees of our subsidiary antigen 
twelve of our employees are executive and administrative  seven are scientific and technical personnel who engage primarily in development activities and in preparing formulations for testing and clinical trials  and two are engaged in corporate and product promotion  public relations and investor relations 
we believe our employee relations are good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we will continue to need qualified scientific personnel and personnel with experience in clinical testing  government regulation and manufacturing 
we may have difficulty in obtaining qualified scientific and technical personnel as there is strong competition for such personnel from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and research institutions 
our business could be materially harmed if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified scientific  administrative and executive personnel to support our expanding activities  or if one or more members of our limited scientific and management staff were unable or unwilling to continue their association with us 
we do not have fixed term agreements with any of our key management or scientific staff  other than dr 
pankaj modi who  on august   resigned from his position as vice president  research and development 
while dr 
modi s resignation was effective immediately  pursuant to the terms of the consulting agreement  the effective date of termination of the consulting agreement was august  for more information about the termination of dr 
modi s consulting agreement  see developments in fiscal under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we also use non employee consultants to assist us in formulating research and development strategy  in preparing regulatory submissions  in developing protocols for clinical trials  and in designing  equipping and staffing our manufacturing facilities 
we also use non employee consultants to assist us in business development 
these consultants and advisors usually have the right to terminate their relationship with us on short notice 
loss of some of these key advisors could interrupt or delay development of one or more of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business plans

certain additional risk factors in addition to historical facts or statements of current condition  this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
the following discussion outlines certain factors that we think could cause our actual outcomes and results to differ materially from our forward looking statements 
these factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
risks related to our financial condition we have a history of losses and will incur additional losses 
we are a development stage company with a limited history of operations  and do not expect sufficient revenues to support our operation in the immediately foreseeable future 
we do expect to receive some revenue from the sale of our oral insulin product in ecuador in fiscal to date  we have not been profitable and our accumulated net loss before preferred stock dividend was  at july  our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  including clinical trials  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
while we seek to attain profitability  we cannot be sure that we will ever achieve product and other revenue sufficient for us to attain this objective 
with the exception of our oral insulin formulation which was approved for commercial sale in ecuador in early may  our product candidates are in research or early stages of pre clinical and clinical development 
we will need to conduct substantial additional research  development and clinical trials 
we will also need to receive necessary regulatory clearances both in the united states and foreign countries and obtain meaningful patent protection for and establish freedom to commercialize each of our product candidates 
we cannot be sure that we will obtain required regulatory approvals  or successfully research  develop  commercialize  manufacture and market any other product candidates 
we expect that these activities  together with future general and administrative activities  will result in significant expenses for the foreseeable future 
we need additional capital 
to progress in product development or marketing  we will need additional capital which may not be available to us 
this may delay our progress in product development or market 
we will require funds in excess of our existing cash resources to proceed with the development of our buccal insulin product  to develop other buccal and immunomedicine products  to develop new products based on our buccal delivery and immunomedicine technologies  including clinical testing relating to new products  to develop or acquire other technologies or other lines of business  to establish and expand our manufacturing capabilities  to finance general and administrative and research activities that are not related to specific products under development  to finance the research and development activities of our subsidiary antigen  and to otherwise carry on business 
in the past  we have funded most of our development and other costs through equity financing 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations through the next three months 
however  this expectation is based on our current operating plan  which could change as a result of many factors  and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
because our operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds in the near future to continue the development and commercialization of our products 
unforeseen problems  including materially negative developments in our clinical trials or in general economic conditions  could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such funding is available 
recent changes in the application of the rules of the nasdaq stock market may also make it more difficult for us to raise private equity capital 
it is possible that we will be unable to obtain additional funding as and when we need it 
if we were unable to obtain additional funding as and when needed  we could be forced to delay the progress of certain development efforts 
such a scenario poses risks 
for example  our ability to bring a product to market and obtain revenues could be delayed  our competitors could develop products ahead of us  and or we could be forced to relinquish rights to technologies  products or potential products 
our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in their audit opinion issued in connection with our consolidated balance sheets as of july  and our consolidated statements of operation  stockholder s equity and cash flows for the year then ended and for the period from november  date of inception to july   our auditors have expressed a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our recurring net losses  negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficiency 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence 
new equity financing could dilute current stockholders 
if we raise funds through equity financing to meet the needs discussed above  it will have a dilutive effect on existing holders of our shares by reducing their percentage ownership 
the shares may be sold at a time when the market price is low because we need the funds 
this will dilute existing holders more than if our stock price was higher 
in addition  equity financings normally involve shares sold at a discount to the current market price 
our research and development and marketing efforts may be highly dependent on corporate collaborators and other third parties who may not devote sufficient time  resources and attention to our programs  which may limit our efforts to successfully develop and market potential products 
because we have limited resources  we have sought to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing  testing  obtaining governmental approval for and commercializing products using our buccal delivery and immunomedicine technologies 
any collaborator with whom we may enter into such collaboration agreements may not support fully our research and commercial interests since our program may compete for time  attention and resources with such collaborator s internal programs 
therefore  these collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our program to move it forward effectively  or that the program will advance as rapidly as it might if we had retained complete control of all research  development  regulatory and commercialization decisions 
risks related to our technologies with the exception of oral lyn  our technologies and products are at an early stage of development and we cannot expect revenues in respect thereof in the foreseeable future 
with the exception of oral lyn  our proprietary oral insulin spray formulation which has been approved for commercial marketing and sale in ecuador for the treatment of type and type diabetes  we have no products approved for commercial sale at the present time 
to be profitable  we must not only successfully research  develop and obtain regulatory approval for our products under development  but also manufacture  introduce  market and distribute them once development is completed 
we may not be successful in one or more of these stages of the development or commercialization of our products  and or any of the products we develop may not be commercially viable 
while over  patients with diabetes have been dosed with our oral insulin formulation at approved facilities in seven countries  our insulin product has only recently been approved for marketing in ecuador 
until we can manufacture  market and distribute our oral insulin product in ecuador and can establish that it is a commercially viable product  we will not receive revenues from ongoing operations 
until we receive regulatory approval to sell our products in one or more countries other than ecuador  our ability to generate revenues from operations may be limited and those revenues may be insufficient to sustain operations 
many factors impact our ability to obtain approvals for commercially viable products 
only one of our products has been approved for commercial sale by drug regulatory authorities  and that approval was obtained in ecuador 
we have begun the regulatory approval process for our oral insulin formulation  buccal morphine and fentanyl products in other countries 
our immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development  with the exception of our phase trial in human patients with stage ii her neu positive breast cancer 
pre clinical and clinical trials of our products  and the manufacturing and marketing of our technologies  are subject to extensive  costly and rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the united states  canada and other countries 
the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities often takes many years  is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidates 
for these reasons  it is possible we will never receive approval for one or more product candidates in any country other than ecuador 
in addition  we cannot be sure when or if we will be permitted by regulatory agencies to undertake additional clinical trials or to commence any particular phase of clinical trials 
because of this  statements in this annual report on form k regarding the expected timing of clinical trials cannot be regarded as actual predictions of when we will obtain regulatory approval for any phase of clinical trials 
delays in obtaining united states or other foreign approvals for our products could result in substantial additional costs to us  and  therefore  could adversely affect our ability to compete with other companies 
if regulatory approval is ultimately granted in any country other than ecuador  the approval may place limitations on the intended use of the product we wish to commercialize  and may restrict the way in which we are permitted to market the product 
due to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights  we may not have meaningful protection from competition 
our long term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement  misappropriation  discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
our patent rights  and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general  are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues 
because of this  our pending patent applications may not be granted 
these uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or will obtain in the future could be subject to challenge  and even if not challenged  may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition 
due to our financial uncertainties  we may not possess the financial resources necessary to enforce our patents 
patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute  and any dispute could be resolved against us 
because a substantial number of patents have been issued in the field of alternative drug delivery and because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions  the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted 
consequently  we do not know whether any of our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or  to the extent patents have been issued or will be issued  whether these patents will be subject to further proceedings limiting their scope  will provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage  or will be circumvented or invalidated 
also because of these legal and factual uncertainties  and because pending patent applications are held in secrecy for varying periods in the united states and other countries  even after reasonable investigation we may not know with certainty whether any products that we or a licensee may develop will infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party 
for example  we are aware of certain patents owned by third parties that such parties could attempt to use in the future in efforts to affect our freedom to practice some of the patents that we own or have applied for 
based upon the science and scope of these third party patents  we believe that the patents that we own or have applied for do not infringe any such third party patents  however  we cannot know for certain whether we could successfully defend our position  if challenged 
we may incur substantial costs if we are required to defend the company in patent suits brought by third parties 
these legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing  manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process 
in addition to potential liability for significant damages  we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process 
risks related to marketing of our potential products we may not become  or stay  profitable even if our products are approved for sale 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our oral insulin product or any other product candidate in another country other than ecuador  many factors may prevent the product from ever being sold in commercial quantities 
some of these factors are beyond our control  such as acceptance of the formulation or treatment by health care professionals and diabetic patients  the availability  effectiveness and relative cost of alternative diabetes or immunomedicine treatments that may be developed by competitors  and the availability of third party ie  insurer and governmental agency reimbursements 
we will not receive revenues from our oral insulin formulation in ecuador or any of our other products that may receive regulatory approval until we can successfully manufacture  market and distribute them in the relevant market 
we will have to depend upon others for marketing and distribution of our products  including oral lyn in ecuador  and we may be forced to enter into contracts limiting the benefits we may receive and the control we have over our products 
we intend to rely on collaborative arrangements with one or more other companies that possess strong marketing and distribution resources to perform these functions for us 
we may not be able to enter into beneficial contracts  and we may be forced to enter into contracts for the marketing and distribution of our products that substantially limit the potential benefits to us from commercializing these products 
in addition  we will not have the same control over marketing and distribution that we would have if we conducted these functions ourselves 
we may not be able to compete with treatments now being marketed and developed  or which may be developed and marketed in the future by other companies 
our products will compete with existing and new therapies and treatments 
we are aware of a number of companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of delivering insulin  as well as new drugs intended to replace insulin therapy at least in part 
we are also aware of a number of companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of enhancing and suppressing peptides 
in the longer term  we also face competition from companies that seek to develop cures for diabetes and other malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases through techniques for correcting the genetic deficiencies that underlie such diseases 
numerous pharmaceutical  biotechnology and drug delivery companies  hospitals  research organizations  individual scientists and nonprofit organizations are engaged in the development of alternatives to our technologies 
some of these companies have greater research and development capabilities  experience  manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies  obtaining fda approval for products or gaining market acceptance more rapidly than we can 
if government programs and insurance companies do not agree to pay for or reimburse patients for our products  our success will be impacted 
sales of our oral insulin formulation in ecuador and our potential products in other markets depend in part on the availability of reimbursement by third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers often challenge the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
governmental approval of health care products does not guarantee that these third party payers will pay for the products 
even if third party payers do accept our product  the amounts they pay may not be adequate to enable us to realize a profit 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement 
risks related to potential liabilities we face significant product liability risks  which may have a negative effect on our financial condition 
the administration of drugs or treatments to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs or treatments are actually at fault for causing an injury 
furthermore  our products may cause  or may appear to have caused  serious adverse side effects including death or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug or treatment has been administered to patients for some time 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a severe negative effect on our financial condition 
we maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable for our current level of activity and exposure  but claims could exceed our coverage limits 
furthermore  due to factors in the insurance market generally and our own experience  we may not always be able to purchase sufficient insurance at an affordable price 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
outcome of an arbitration proceeding with sands brothers may have an adverse impact on us 
on october   sands brothers co 
ltd  a new york city based investment banking and brokerage firm  initiated an arbitration against us under new york stock exchange rules 
sands alleged that it had the right to receive  for nominal consideration  approximately million shares of our common stock 
sands based its claim upon an october letter agreement that was purported by sands to confirm an agreement appointing sands as the exclusive financial advisor to generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a subsidiary that we acquired in late in exchange therefor  the letter agreement purported to grant sands the right to acquire of generex pharmaceuticals common stock for nominal consideration 
sands claimed that its right to receive shares of generex pharmaceuticals common stock applies to our common stock since outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals common stock were converted into shares of our common stock in the acquisition 
sands claims also included additional shares allegedly due as a fee related to that acquisition  and  in monthly fees allegedly due under the terms of the purported agreement 
after several arbitration and court proceedings  on october   the appellate division of the new york supreme court issued a decision remanding the issue of damages to a new panel of arbitrators and limiting the issue of damages before the new panel to reliance damages which is not to include an award of lost profits 
reliance damages are out of pocket damages incurred by sands 
on august   the arbitration panel of the new york stock exchange issued a final award in the case of sands versus us  awarding sands  in reliance damages 
a motion to confirm this award has been awarded to sands 
in september  sands filed a motion seeking leave from the new york court of appeals to appeal the prior orders of the appellate division vacating the prior arbitration panel s warrant awards 
accordingly   has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements  but the case may be subject to further legal proceedings 
the case is still ongoing and our ultimate liability cannot yet be determined with certainty 
our financial condition would be materially adversely affected to the extent that sands receives shares of our common stock for little or no consideration or substantial monetary damages as a result of this legal proceeding 
apart from  accrual  we are not able to estimate an amount or range of potential loss from this legal proceeding at the present time 
risks related to the market for our common stock our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
on june   our common stock was delisted from the nasdaq national market because of our failure to maintain a minimum of  in stockholders equity 
on june   our stock began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the nasdaq smallcap market has its own standards for continued listing  including a minimum of million stockholders equity 
as of july   our stockholders equity was  as a result  on november   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market informing us that we do not comply with marketplace rule c b  which requires us to have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
on december   all outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock were converted to common stock  resulting in the elimination of approximately  of mezzanine equity and an equal amount was added to additional paid in capital attributable to the common stock  increasing stockholders equity by that amount 
based on this  the delisting proceeding relating to failure to meet stockholders equity standards was terminated 
because we are still in the development stage  there is no guarantee that we will sustain compliance with this standard 
in the event we cannot sustain compliance  our shares of common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market and begin trading on the over the counter bulletin board 
in addition  for continued listing on both the nasdaq national market and smallcap market  our stock price must be at least 
since october of  our stock price has traded below this minimum per share requirement for thirty consecutive business days 
as a result  on november   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market informing us that we do not comply with market rule c  which requires us to have a minimum bid price per share of at least for thirty consecutive business days 
we had calendar days  or until may   subject to extension by the nasdaq stock market under certain circumstances  to regain compliance with the rule 
on may   we received notice from the staff of the nasdaq stock market informing us that  during the calendar day period ending may   we had not regained compliance with marketplace rule c  however  the staff noted that on may   we met all initial inclusion criteria for the smallcap market set forth in marketplace rule c  except for bid price 
therefore  in accordance with marketplace rule c d  we have an additional calendar days to regain compliance with rule c 
although we have until november  to regain compliance with the rule  there is no guarantee that the bid price of our common stock will close at per share or more for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days  which is the minimum period of time the nasdaq stock market requires to regain compliance 
in the event that we cannot demonstrate compliance with marketplace rule c by november  and are not eligible for an additional compliance period  the staff will notify us that our stock will be delisted  at which time we may appeal the staff s determination to a listing qualifications panel 
pending the decision of the listing qualification panel  our common stock will continue to trade on the smallcap market 
if we are not successful in such an appeal  our stock will likely trade on nasdaq s over the counter bulletin board  assuming we meet the requisite criteria 
if our stock is delisted from nasdaq smallcap market  it may become subject to penny stock regulations and there will be less interest for our stock in the market 
this may result in lower prices for our stock and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 
if our stock is not listed on nasdaq and fails to maintain a price of or more per share  our stock would become subject to the securities and exchange commission s penny stock rules 
these rules require a broker to deliver  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its risks 
additionally  broker dealers who recommend penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination and receive the purchaser s written agreement to a transaction prior to the sale 
in the event our stock becomes subject to these rules  it will become more difficult for broker dealers to sell our common stock 
therefore  it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
there may be wide fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be caused by several factors including announcements of research activities and technology innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in market valuation of companies in our industry generally  variations in operating results  changes in governmental regulations  developments in patent and other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of drugs or treatments developed by us or others  results of clinical trials of our products or our competitors products  and regulatory action or inaction on our products or our competitors products 
from time to time  we may hire companies to assist us in pursuing investor relations strategies to generate increased volumes of investment in our common stock 
such activities may result  among other things  in causing the price of our common stock to increase on a short term basis 
furthermore  the stock market generally and the market for stocks of companies with lower market capitalizations and small biopharmaceutical companies  like us  have from time to time experienced  and likely will again experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
our outstanding special voting rights preferred stock and provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation could delay or prevent the acquisition or sale of our business 
holders of our special voting rights preferred stock have the ability to prevent any change of control in us 
dr 
pankaj modi  a former officer and director of generex  owns all of our special voting rights preferred stock 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate new series of preferred stock and issue those shares without any vote or action by our stockholders 
such newly authorized and issued shares of preferred stock could contain terms that grant special voting rights to the holders of such shares that make it more difficult to obtain stockholder approval for an acquisition of our business or increase the cost of any such acquisition 
item properties 
our executive and principal administrative offices occupy approximately  square feet of office space in the business centre at harbour square in downtown toronto  ontario  canada 
we own the business centre  which comprises approximately  square feet of usable space 
the space in the business centre that is not used by us is leased to third parties 
we own a laboratory facility in toronto that we have used for limited production of our oral insulin formulation for clinical purposes  and have completed a pilot manufacturing facility for our insulin product in the same commercial complex 
our laboratory facility is approximately  square feet 
our pilot manufacturing facility  which also includes laboratory facilities  is approximately  square feet 
we also own all additional units in the same building where our pilot manufacturing facility is located 
these units are currently leased to third parties and one is being used for storage 
these units are reflected in assets held for investments on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all of these spaces could be used for manufacturing facilities if necessary 
we have obtained regulatory approval for the laboratory facility  and we are currently in the process of obtaining regulatory approval for the pilot manufacturing facility 
we have mortgages on our toronto properties totaling  at july  these mortgages require the payment of interest  with minimal principal reduction  prior to their due dates 
these mortgages currently require an aggregate  in monthly debt service payments 
aggregate principal maturities for these mortgages will be  in fiscal and  in fiscal we lease approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space in worcester  massachusetts that antigen uses for its research and development activities at an annual rent of  this space is sufficient for antigen s present activities 
we do not expect to need additional manufacturing capabilities in canada related to our insulin product beyond our pilot facility before the end of the current fiscal year 
we own an  square foot building in brampton  ontario  which is approximately miles outside toronto  and a  square foot building in mississauga  ontario  which is about miles from downtown toronto  for ultimate use in manufacturing 
we have done preliminary work on these facilities  but we do not expect to make a substantial investment in improving and equipping them for manufacturing operations until our requirements in this area are better defined 
both properties are currently leased to third parties 
we could use our other properties to expand research  development or testing of our buccal and immunomedicine products if current facilities prove inadequate for our needs

on july   we filed a preliminary motion to dismiss the action of cti as a nonexistent entity or  alternatively  to stay such action on the grounds of want of authority of such entity to commence the action 
the plaintiffs brought a cross motion to amend the statement of claim to substitute centrum biotechnologies  inc cbi for cti 
cbi is a corporation of which percent of the shares are owned by the former business associate and the remaining percent are owned by us 
consequently  the shareholders of cbi are in a deadlock

corporate history we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
p 
s  inc  a previously inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our shareholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gb delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
in august  we acquired antigen express  inc antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
business history we are engaged primarily in the research and development of drug delivery technologies 
our primary focus at the present time is our proprietary technology for the administration of formulations of large molecule drugs to the oral buccal cavity using a hand held aerosol applicator 
our first product is an insulin formulation that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using a hand held aerosol spray applicator 
between january and september  we conducted limited clinical trials on this product in the united states  canada and europe 
in september  we entered into an agreement the development and license agreement to develop this product with eli lilly and company lilly 
to date  over  patients with diabetes have been dosed with our oral insulin product at approved facilities in seven countries 
we conducted several clinical trials with insulin supplied by lilly under our development and license agreement 
lilly did not  however  authorize or conduct any clinical trials or provide financial support for those trials 
we did receive a  upfront payment from lilly 
on may   we announced that we had agreed with lilly to end the development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of buccal delivery of insulin 
on november   we entered into a termination agreement with lilly terminating the development and license agreement  effective as of june  in accordance with the termination agreement  we retained all of the intellectual property and commercialization rights with respect to buccal spray drug delivery technology  and we have the continuing right to develop and commercialize the product 
we also entered into a bulk supply agreement the bulk supply agreement for the sale of human insulin crystals by lilly to us over a three year period 
in january  we established a joint venture with elan international services  ltd 
eis  a wholly owned subsidiary of elan corporation  plc eis and elan corporation  plc being collectively referred to as elan  to pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products  for the treatment of prostate cancer  endometriosis and or the suppression of testosterone and estrogen 
in january  we and elan agreed to expand the joint venture to encompass the buccal delivery of morphine for the treatment of pain and agreed to pursue buccal morphine as the initial pharmaceutical product for development under generex bermuda ltd  the entity through which the joint venture was being conducted 
this expansion of the joint venture occurred after we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical study of morphine delivery using our proprietary buccal delivery technology 
in connection with the joint venture  eis purchased  shares of our series a preferred stock for  which eis transferred  shortly thereafter  to elan pharmaceuticals investment iii  an affiliate of elan epil iii 
we applied the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock to subscribe for an equity ownership interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
eis paid in capital of  to subscribe for a equity ownership interest in the joint venture entity 
in accordance with the terms of the series a preferred stock  if any shares of series a preferred stock were to be outstanding on january   we would have been required to redeem the shares of series a preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the aggregate series a preferred stock liquidation preference  either in cash  or in shares of common stock with a fair market value equal to the redemption price 
alternatively  the series a preferred stock could have been converted  under certain conditions  into shares of our common stock 
eis also purchased  shares of our common stock for  we were permitted to use the proceeds of this sale for any corporate purpose 
on december   we entered into an agreement the termination agreement with elan  whereby we and elan agreed to terminate the joint venture through generex bermuda ltd 
pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement  i except for a common stock purchase warrant that was issued by us to elan  which was amended to permit elan or any other holder thereof to transfer the warrant without our consent  the parties agreed to terminate all agreements entered into in connection with the joint venture  and ii elan agreed to transfer all shares of capital stock of generex bermuda owned by it to us 
accordingly  all rights granted by each party to the other terminated  including  without limitation  elan s right to appoint a member to our board of directors  all other rights granted under the terms of the joint venture terminated  each party retained its intellectual property rights  we obtained full ownership of generex bermuda  and all representatives of elan who were officers and or directors of generex bermuda resigned 
in connection with negotiating the termination agreement  epil iii approached us for consent to transfer the series a preferred stock by way of an auction process 
although we provided our consent to the transfer  it was contingent upon epil iii agreeing to satisfy the following conditions i the auction process could conclude no later than december  and epil iii s disposition of the shares could conclude no later than december  the closing date  ii the buyer had to immediately convert the series a preferred stock at the voluntary conversion price of calculated pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock  iii epil iii s registration rights could not be transferred  and iv for a period of two years after the closing date  the purchaser of the series a preferred stock could not transfer the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof and we would have the right to redeem the shares of common stock at a per share price of of the average closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market for the twenty days immediately preceding the closing date 
on or about december   epil iii conducted the auction and received an offer to buy the shares of series a preferred stock 
on or about december   epil iii sold the shares of series a preferred stock  and the purchaser thereof immediately converted the series a preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
the conversion of the series a preferred stock was particularly critical because the mandatory redemption feature required us to classify the series a preferred stock as approximately  of mezzanine equity 
upon conversion of the series a preferred stock  however  we were able to reclassify the approximately  of mezzanine equity as common equity on our balance sheet 
this  in turn  allowed us to regain compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule c b  which requires us to have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
in august  we acquired antigen express  inc antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
our immunomedicine products work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents ie  cancer cells  bacteria  and viruses or to stop attacking benign elements ie  self proteins and allergens 
our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies that were discovered by an executive officer of antigen  the ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression 
the immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development  and trials in human patients are not expected for at least six months 
development efforts are underway in melanoma  breast cancer  prostate cancer  hiv  influenza virus  smallpox  sars and type i diabetes mellitus 
we are establishing collaborations with clinical investigators at academic centers to advance the technology  with the ultimate goal of conducting human clinical testing 
with the anticipated launch of commercial sales of our oral insulin product in ecuador in  we expect to receive revenues from product sales in the fiscal year ending july  we do not expect this revenue to be sufficient for all of our cash needs during the year 
in the past we were able to fund antigen expenses with some revenue from research grants for antigen s immunomedicine products 
during the fiscal year ended july   we received a total of  in such research grants  and we have received a total of  in such research grants 
we do not expect to receive such grants on the going forward basis 
we expect to satisfy the majority of our cash needs during the current year from capital raised through equity financings 
disclosure regarding research and development projects our major research and development projects are the refinement of our basic buccal delivery technology  our buccal insulin project and our buccal morphine product 
both our insulin product and our morphine product are in clinical trials 
during last fiscal year we did not expend resources to further our buccal morphine product 
in canada  we are in the process of finalizing submission to canadian hpb to start phase iii trials for our insulin 
in order to obtain fda and canadian hpb approval for any of our product candidates  we will be required to complete phase iii trials which involve testing our product with a large number of patients over a significant period of time 
the conduct of phase iii trials will require significantly greater funds than we either have on hand or have experience in raising in any year or two years time 
we will therefore need to receive funding from a corporate collaborator  or engage in fundraising on a scale with which we have no experience 
our insulin product  oral lyn  was approved for commercial sale by drug regulatory authorities in ecuador in early may it is our intention that our south american joint venture partner  pharmabrand sa  will handle the commercial launch of oral lyn in ecuador  subject to obtaining financing needed for launch and a suitable production facility 
we will require substantial amounts in additional funding to successfully launch oral lyn on a commercial basis in ecuador 
because of various uncertainties  we cannot predict the timing of completion and commercialization of our buccal insulin or buccal morphine products 
these uncertainties include the success of current studies  our ability to obtain the required financing and the time required to obtain regulatory approval even if our research and development efforts are completed and successful 
for the same reasons  we cannot predict when any products may begin to produce net cash inflows 
most of our buccal delivery research and development activities to date have involved developing our platform technology for use with insulin and morphine 
insubstantial amounts have been expended on projects with other drugs  and those projects involved a substantial amount of platform technology development 
therefore  in the past  we have not made significant distinctions in the accounting for research and development expenses among products  as a significant portion of all research has involved improvements to the platform technology in connection with insulin  which may benefit all of our potential products 
during fiscal  approximately of our  in research expenses was attributable to insulin and platform technology development  and did not spend any money on morphine and fentanyl projects 
as morphine and fentanyl are both narcotic painkillers  the research is related 
in the same period of fiscal  approximately of our  of research and development was expended for insulin and platform technology  and approximately for morphine and fentanyl 
approximately or  of our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were related to antigen s immunomedicine products compared to approximately or  for the fiscal year ended july  because these products are in a very early  pre clinical stage of development  all of the expenses were accounted for as basic research and no distinctions were made as to particular products 
because of the early stage of development  we cannot predict the timing of completion of any products arising from this technology  or when products from this technology might begin producing revenues 
developments in fiscal on august   we issued an aggregate  shares of our common stock and  warrants to purchase our common stock to certain consultants in exchange for financial services recognizing expense of  to financial services 
on august   dr 
pankaj modi resigned from his position as an officer of generex 
also  on august   dr 
modi notified us that the consulting agreement between dr 
modi and us would terminate effective august  we do not believe that dr 
modi s resignation or the termination of his consulting agreement with us has  or will  materially adversely affect us 
on october   we granted a total of  options to purchase shares of our common stock to certain employees and consultants at per share and  options to an employee to purchase shares of our common stock at per share 
the options issued to non employees resulted in  charge to operations 
on november   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with four accredited investors for a private placement of secured convertible debentures the debentures and warrants for an aggregate purchase price of  we completed this private placement on november  the debentures have a term of fifteen months and amortize over thirteen months in thirteen equal monthly installments beginning on the first day of the third month following their issuance 
interest on the principal amount outstanding will accrue at a rate of six percent per annum 
we may pay principal and accrued interest in cash or  at our option  in shares of our common stock 
if we elect to pay principal and interest in shares of our common stock  the value of each share of common stock will be equal to the lesser of i and ii ninety percent of the average of the twenty trading day volume weighted average price for the common stock for the twenty trading day period immediately preceding the date of payment 
at the option of the holder of each debenture  the principal amount outstanding under each debenture is initially convertible at any time after the closing of the private placement into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 
the conversion price of each debenture is based on the average of the ten trading day volume weighted average price for our common stock for the ten trading day period immediately preceding the date definitive agreements were signed 
the warrants are initially exercisable into the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the debentures 
the initial exercise price of each warrant is equal to of the conversion price of the debentures  or 
the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants are each subject to an anti dilution adjustment upon the issuance by us of securities at a price per share less than the then conversion price or exercise price  as applicable 
in accordance with the terms of the private placement  we were required to register for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and upon exercise of the warrants 
on december   we filed a registration statement on form s file no 
in connection with this transaction 
the registration statement became effective on january  in connection with the november  transaction  we granted an additional investment right to each investor 
pursuant to the terms of each additional investment right  each investor has the right at any time prior to january   to purchase on the same terms and conditions as the private placement  up to the same number of debentures and warrants purchased by such investor at the closing of the private placement 
in addition  we paid to a placement agent i a cash fee equal to seven percent of the gross proceeds received by us and ii warrants exercisable into approximately  shares of our common stock at the same exercise price as the investors warrants 
the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the november  transaction exceeds of the outstanding shares of our common stock prior to such issuance 
because the rules and regulations of the nasdaq stock market prohibit  under certain circumstances  the issuance  without prior stockholder approval  of shares of common stock in excess of of an issuer s outstanding common stock prior to such issuance  certain insiders entered into a voting agreement with the investors  whereby such insiders agreed to vote at the annual meeting of stockholders all shares of our common stock held by them in favor of authorizing the issuance of an amount of shares of our common stock in excess of of the outstanding common stock prior to consummating the transaction 
as discussed above in part i item submission of matters to a vote of security holders  at the annual meeting of stockholders  this proposal was approved by our stockholders 
we undertook this offering in reliance upon rule of regulation d and section b d of the securities act 
on november   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market informing us that we did not comply with marketplace rule c b  which requires us to have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
however  upon consummation in december of the transactions contemplated by a termination agreement we entered into with elan  as more fully described below  we regained compliance with marketplace rule c b 
on november   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market informing us that we did not comply with marketplace rule c  which requires us to have a minimum bid price per share of at least for thirty consecutive business days 
in accordance with marketplace rule c d  we had calendar days from the date of the notice  or until may   to regain compliance with the rule 
as more fully described below  because we met all initial inclusion criteria for the smallcap market set forth in marketplace rule c  except for bid price  as of may   we have until november  to regain compliance with marketplace rule c 
on december   we entered into an agreement the termination agreement with elan  whereby we and elan agreed to terminate the joint venture through generex bermuda ltd 
pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement  i except for a common stock purchase warrant that was issued by us to elan  which was amended to permit elan or any other holder thereof to transfer the warrant without our consent  the parties agreed to terminate all agreements entered into in connection with the joint venture  and ii elan agreed to transfer all shares of capital stock of generex bermuda owned by it to us 
accordingly  all rights granted by each party to the other terminated  including  without limitation  elan s right to appoint a member to our board of directors  all other rights granted under the terms of the joint venture terminated  each party retained its intellectual property rights  we obtained full ownership of generex bermuda  and all representatives of elan who were officers and or directors of generex bermuda resigned 
in connection with negotiating the termination agreement  epil iii approached us for consent to transfer the series a preferred stock by way of an auction process 
although we provided our consent to the transfer  it was contingent upon epil iii agreeing to satisfy the following conditions i the auction process could conclude no later than december  and epil iii s disposition of the shares could conclude no later than december  the closing date  ii the buyer had to immediately convert the series a preferred stock at the voluntary conversion price of calculated pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock  iii epil iii s registration rights could not be transferred  and iv for a period of two years after the closing date  the purchaser of the series a preferred stock could not transfer the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof and we would have the right to redeem the shares of common stock at a per share price of of the average closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market for the twenty days immediately preceding the closing date 
on or about december   epil iii conducted the auction and received an offer to buy the shares of series a preferred stock 
on or about december   epil iii sold the shares of series a preferred stock  and the purchaser thereof immediately converted the series a preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
the conversion of the series a preferred stock was particularly critical because the mandatory redemption feature required us to classify the series a preferred stock as approximately  of mezzanine equity 
upon conversion of the series a preferred stock  however  we were able to reclassify the approximately  of mezzanine equity as common equity on our balance sheet 
this  in turn  allowed us to regain compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule c b  which requires us to have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years

results of operations year ended july  compared to year ended july  we had a net loss of  for the year ended july  fiscal compared to a net loss of  in the year ended july  fiscal 
the net loss for fiscal and excludes and  respectively  in non cash stock dividend on preferred shares 
the main reason for the increase in net loss for the year is attributed to interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with convertible debentures entered during fiscal year 
our operation loss for the year decreased to  compared to  in operating loss for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in our fiscal operating loss resulted from a decrease in research and development expenses to  from  despite an increase in general and administrative expenses to  from 
our revenue had also decreased from  in to  in the fiscal year ended july  the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflects the increase in legal  audit and accounting  financial and consulting services and executive compensation 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in level of participation in industry shows and seminars  travel associated with shows and financing activities  as well as decreased advertising and fewer payments on termination agreements 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal reflects decreased level of research and development activities despite the increase in activities of antigen 
numbers for fiscal also reflected bulk insulin purchases that were absent this year 
our interest expense in fiscal increased to  compared to interest expense of  in fiscal due to interest paid in connection with convertible debentures entered into during the current fiscal year 
our interest and miscellaneous income decreased to  in compared to  l in fiscal primarily due to lower cash and short term investments balances during the current fiscal year

the net loss for fiscal and excludes  and  respectively  in non cash stock dividend on preferred shares 
the increase in our fiscal net loss resulted from an increase in research and development expenses to  from  and an increase in general and administrative expenses to  from 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal reflects research and development activities of antigen  the increase in activities of regulatory consultants  bulk insulin purchases and an increase in depreciation of the patents due to additional patents acquired in the acquisition of antigen 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflects the increase in consulting services  increased level of participation in industry shows and seminars  travel associated with shows and financing activities  increased insurance and depreciation expenses as well as termination agreements 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in legal and litigation expenses and a reduction in executive compensation 
our interest and miscellaneous income net of interest expense in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal due to decreases in our cash and short term investments and lower interest rates 
we received higher income from rental operations net of expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in both of the last two fiscal years  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fiscal and  in fiscal were paid partially through the issuance of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
financial condition  liquidity and resources to date we have financed our development stage activities primarily through private placements of our common stock and securities convertible into our common stock 
at july   we had cash and short term investments of approximately  at july   our cash and short term investments were approximately  the decrease was attributable to the use of cash for ongoing operations 
at july   we believed that our anticipated cash position was sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next three months based on the pace of our planned development activities 
beyond that  we will likely require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes 
from time to time as deemed appropriate by management  we may seek to raise funds through private or public equity financing or from other sources 
if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed  we could be required to scale back or otherwise revise our business plan 
any significant scale back of operations or modification of our business plan due to a lack of funding could be expected to affect our prospects materially and adversely

in the past  we have funded most of our development and other costs with equity financing 
while we have been able to raise equity capital as required  unforeseen problems with our clinical program or materially negative developments in general economic conditions could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital as needed  or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such capital is available 
going concern uncertainty in their audit opinion issued in connection with our consolidated balance sheets as of july  and our consolidated statements of operation  stockholder s equity and cash flows for the year then ended and for the period from november  date of inception to july   our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our recurring net losses  negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficiency 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit at july  of approximately million 
we have funded our activities to date almost exclusively from debt and equity financings 
we are in the development stage and have realized minimal revenues to date 
we will continue to require substantial funds to continue research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  and to commence sales and marketing efforts  if the fda or other regulatory approvals are obtained 
management s plans in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements include financing activities such as private placement of our common stock  preferred stock offerings  debt and convertible debt instruments 
management is also actively pursuing industry collaboration activities including product licensing and specific project financing 
while we believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations  there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that we will succeed in our future operations 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property and equipment may not be recoverable under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred based upon expected future cash flows  the loss is recognized in the statement of operations 
intangible assets 
we have intangible assets related to patents 
the determination of the related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
in assessing the recoverability of these intangible assets  we use an estimate of undiscounted operating income and related cash flows over the remaining useful life  market conditions and other factors to determine the recoverability of the asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets 
estimating accrued liabilities  specifically litigation accruals 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to pending litigation is based on management s best estimate of future costs 
while the final resolution of the litigation could result in amounts different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period  management believes the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors  and the company does not have any non consolidated special purpose entities 
contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total related party transactions on may   we advanced  to each of three senior officers  who are also our stockholders  in exchange for promissory notes 
these notes bore interest at per annum and were payable in full on may  these notes were guaranteed by a related company owned by these officers and secured by a pledge of  shares of our common stock owned by this related company 
on june   our board of directors extended the maturity date of the loans to october  the other terms and conditions of the loans and guaranty remained unchanged and in full force and effect 
as of july   the balance outstanding on these notes  including accrued interest  was  pursuant to a decision made by the compensation committee as of august   these loans were satisfied through the application of  shares of pledged stock  at a value of per share  which represented the lowest closing price during the sixty days prior to august  prior to january   a portion of our general and administrative expenses resulted from transactions with affiliated persons  and a number of capital transactions also involved affiliated persons 
although these transactions were not the result of arms length negotiations  we do not believe that this fact had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
prior to december   we classified certain payments to executive officers for compensation and expense reimbursements as research and development related party and general and administrative related party because the executive officers received such payments through personal services corporations rather than directly 
after december   these payments have been and will continue to be accounted for as though the payments were made directly to the officers  and not as a related party transaction 
with the exception of our arrangement with our management company described below  we do not foresee a need for  and therefore do not anticipate  any related party transactions in the current fiscal year 
on august   we purchased real estate with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million from an unaffiliated party 
in connection with that transaction  angara enterprises  inc  a licensed real estate broker that is an affiliate of anna gluskin  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  received a commission from the proceeds of the sale to the seller in the amount of of the purchase price  or  we believe that this is less than the aggregate commission which would have been payable if a commission had been negotiated with an unaffiliated broker on an arm s length basis 
we utilize a management company to manage all of our real properties 
the property management company is owned by rose perri  our chief operating officer  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  anna gluskin and the estate of mark perri  our former chairman of the board 
in the fiscal years ended july  and we paid the management company approximately  and  respectively  in management fees

 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments using the fair value based method 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the next fiscal year that begins after june  sfas r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas r is similar to sfas  with minor exceptions 
the impact on the results of operations and earnings per share had we adopted sfas  is described in the stock based compensation section of note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 
financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
due to timing of the release of sfas r  we have not yet completed the analysis of the ultimate impact that this new pronouncement will have on our results of operations  nor the method of adoption for this new standard 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance

item 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the exchange rates between us and canadian currencies and with changes in the interest rates related to our fixed rate debt 
we do not believe that any of these risks will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
at the present time  we maintain our cash in short term government or government guaranteed instruments  short term commercial paper  interest bearing bank deposits or demand bank deposits which do not earn interest 
a substantial majority of these instruments and deposits are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of funds denominated in canadian dollars on deposit in canadian banks to meet short term operating needs in canada 
at the present time  with the exception of professional fees and costs associated with the conduct of clinical trials in the united states and europe  substantially all of our operating expense obligations are denominated in canadian dollars 
we do not presently employ any hedging or similar strategy intended to mitigate against losses that could be incurred as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates between us and canadian currencies 
as of july   we have fixed rate debt totaling  this amount consists of the following loan amount interest rate per annum total these debt instruments mature from october through august as our fixed rate debt instruments mature  we will likely refinance such debt at the existing market interest rates which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt 
since this debt is fixed rate debt  if interest rates were to increase basis points prior to maturity  there would be no impact on earnings or cash flows 
we have neither issued nor own any long term debt instruments  or any other financial instruments  for trading purposes and as to which we would be subject to material market risks
