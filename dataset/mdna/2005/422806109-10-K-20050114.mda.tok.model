the company s results of operations during each of the past three fiscal years have been affected by a number of transactions 
this discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
for further information regarding the acquisitions and strategic alliances discussed below  see note  acquisitions and strategic alliances  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are included in the company s results of operations from the effective dates of acquisition 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company acquired jetseal  inc and niacc technology  inc  respectively 
the purchase price of each acquisition was paid primarily by using proceeds from the company s revolving credit facility and was not significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
had the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions been made at the beginning of their respective fiscal years  the pro forma consolidated operating results would not have been materially different from the reported results 
in december  the company acquired an interest in sierra microwave technology  inc sierra through the electronic technologies group 
under the transaction  the company formed a new subsidiary  sierra microwave technology  llc sierra llc  which acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of sierra 
the new subsidiary is owned by the company and by certain members of sierra s management group 
the purchase price was paid principally in cash using proceeds from the company s revolving credit facility and with shares of the company s class a common stock 
the purchase price of the acquisition was not significant to the company s consolidated financial statements and the pro forma consolidated operating results assuming sierra had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal would not have been materially different from the reported results 
however  the operating results of sierra llc have had a positive impact on the electronic technologies group  the smaller of the company s two operating segments  as further explained within this item under the caption comparison of fiscal to fiscal 
in october  the company entered into a strategic alliance with lufthansa technik ag  the technical services subsidiary of lufthansa german airlines  whereby lufthansa technik invested approximately million in heico aerospace  including million paid at closing pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and approximately million paid to heico aerospace pursuant to a research and development cooperation agreement  which has partially funded the accelerated development of additional faa approved replacement parts for jet engines and aircraft components 
the funds received as a result of the research and development cooperation agreement reduced research and development expenses in the periods such expenses were incurred 
in addition  lufthansa technik and heico aerospace have agreed to cooperate regarding technical services and marketing support for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts on a worldwide basis 
in connection with subsequent acquisitions by heico aerospace  lufthansa technik invested additional amounts aggregating to approximately million pursuant to its option to maintain a equity interest 
in march  the company entered into a joint venture with american airlines parent company  amr corporation  to develop  design and sell faa approved jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts through heico aerospace 
as part of the joint venture  amr corporation reimburses heico aerospace a portion of new product research and development costs 
the funds received as a result of the new product research and development costs paid by amr corporation generally reduce new product research and development expenses in the period such expenses are incurred 
the balance of the development costs are incurred by the joint venture  which is owned by amr corporation 
in addition  amr corporation and heico aerospace have agreed to cooperate regarding technical services and marketing support on a worldwide basis 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most critical accounting policies  some of which require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on an accrual basis  primarily upon the shipment of products and the rendering of services 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts for which costs can be dependably estimated is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
variations in actual labor performance  changes to estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to cost estimates 
revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the period of revision 
for fixed price contracts in which costs cannot be dependably estimated  revenue is recognized on the completed contract method 
a contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred or the item has been accepted by the customer 
the aggregate effects of changes in estimates relating to inventories and or long term contracts did not have a significant effect on net income or diluted net income per share in fiscal  or valuation of accounts receivable the valuation of accounts receivable requires that the company set up an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts and record a corresponding charge to bad debt expense 
the company estimates uncollectible receivables based on such factors as its prior experience  its appraisal of a customer s ability to pay  and economic conditions within and outside of the aviation  defense  space  and electronics industries 
actual bad debt expense could differ from estimates made 
valuation of inventory a portion of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on the first in  first out or the average cost basis 
the remaining portion of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  on a per contract accumulation of contract costs basis  with estimated total contract costs being allocated ratably to all units 
the effects of changes in estimated total contract costs are recognized in the period of revision 
losses  if any  are recognized fully in the period when identified 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventory  giving consideration to factors such as its physical condition  sales patterns  and expected future demand and estimates the amount necessary to write down its slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the estimated write downs were made 
valuation of goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of october or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test requires the company to compare the fair value of each of its reporting units to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill is to be calculated and an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any 
the determination of fair value requires the company to make a number of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
if there is a material change in such assumptions used by the company in determining fair value or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  the company could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 
based on the annual goodwill test for impairment as of october   the company determined there is no impairment of its goodwill 
one of the company s reporting units has experienced a decline in sales to foreign military customers over the past two fiscal years 
the reporting unit is actively developing various expanded capabilities  but experienced some delays in fiscal based on progress to date  the company continues to expect that the various expanded capabilities will result in significant sales and earnings for the reporting unit beginning in fiscal and beyond 
the timing of such sales and earnings are primarily based upon certain regulatory and sales matters 
using management s best estimates of these assumptions  the company determined that there is no impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill as of october  should the reporting unit incur significant delays in further developing the expanded capabilities and successfully selling and marketing them  the company could be required to recognize an impairment of all or a portion of the reporting unit s goodwill  which had a carrying value of million as of october  results of operations the following table sets forth the results of the company s operations  net sales and operating income by operating segment  and the percentage of net sales represented by the respective items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended october  net sales    cost of sales    selling  general and administrative expenses    total operating costs and expenses    operating income    net sales by segment flight support group    electronic technologies group    intersegment sales    operating income by segment flight support group    electronic technologies group    other  primarily corporate    net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest and other income life insurance proceeds gain on sale of product line income tax expense minority interests share of income net income comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales in fiscal increased by to million  as compared to net sales of million in fiscal the increase in net sales reflects an increase of million a increase to million in sales within the fsg  and an increase of million a increase to million in sales within the etg 
the fsg s sales increase primarily reflects improved demand for its aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul services  which reflects continuing recovery within the commercial airline industry  as well as increased sales of new products

during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company incurred an aggregate of  of restructuring expenses within certain subsidiaries of the fsg that provide repair and overhaul services repair and overhaul subsidiaries 
the unexpected death of an executive of certain of the repair and overhaul subsidiaries see life insurance proceeds below was the impetus for the commencement of the restructuring activities  which the company believes will allow it to better service its customers and improve operating margins 
the restructuring expenses include  of inventory write downs  which were recorded within cost of sales  and  of management hiring relocation related expenses   of moving costs and other associated expenses and  of contract termination costs that were all recorded within selling  general and administrative sg a expenses

these increases were partially offset by the increase in corporate expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales reflects an increase in the etg s operating income as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal and an increase in the fsg s operating income as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal despite a 
decrease attributable to the aforementioned restructuring expenses and litigation related expenses 
the improvement in the etg s operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales reflects the purchase of sierra and the increased sales  discussed previously

the sales decrease within the etg is primarily attributed to a decline in demand from certain foreign military customers 
gross profit and operating expenses the company s gross profit margins averaged in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to lower margins within the etg attributed to lower foreign military sales and lower sales of other higher margin products 
the fsg s gross profit margins in fiscal approximated fiscal margins

the decline in new product research and development expenses was in line with a decrease in the amount budgeted for fiscal relative to actual fiscal expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses is mainly due to lower commission expenses within the etg due to the lower sales discussed previously  lower corporate expenses  and reduced bad debt expenses within the fsg

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial instruments  including interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
the company engages in transactions in the normal course of business that expose it to market risks 
the primary market risk to which the company has exposure is interest rate risk  mainly related to its revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds  which had an aggregate outstanding balance of million as of october  interest rates on borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility are based on libor plus a variable margin  while interest rates on the industrial development revenue bonds are based on variable rates 
interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates 
based on the outstanding debt balance as of october   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  in fiscal the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  a hypothetical increase in interest rates as of october  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
