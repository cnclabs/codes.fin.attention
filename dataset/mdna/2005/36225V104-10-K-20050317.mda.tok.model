item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general overview the company s primary operating entity is general physics  a global workforce development company that improves the effectiveness of organizations by providing training  management consulting  e learning solutions and engineering services that are customized to meet the specific needs of clients 
clients include fortune companies  manufacturing  process and energy companies and other commercial and governmental customers 
the company s other operating entity is its majority owned subsidiary  gse systems inc gse  which was formerly called the simulation segment 
gse is a world leader in real time high fidelity simulation technology and model development and provides simulation solutions and services to the power generation industry  the process industries  and the us government sector 
in addition  gse provides plant monitoring and signal analysis monitoring and optimization software primarily to the power industry  and develops specialized software applications for emerging technologies 
prior to november  the company had five operating business segments manufacturing process  information technology  simulation  optical plastics and home improvement distribution 
on november   we completed the distribution  which we refer to as the spin off  of the common stock of national patent development corporation npdc  which comprised our optical plastics and home improvement distribution segments and certain other non core assets 
we reorganized the manufacturing process and information technology segments into the general physics segment 
effective with the spin off  the operations of npdc were reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
general physics overview general physics provides performance improvement services and products to multinational companies in manufacturing and process industries  electric power utilities and other commercial and governmental customers 
general physics is a global leader in performance improvement  with over three decades of experience in providing solutions to optimize workforce performance 
in general physics showed a significant increase in profit  and continued to post improved revenue results 
the improvement in performance is primarily attributable to the company s key initiatives  business process outsourcing and training  e learning  and domestic preparedness and emergency management 
the company experienced growth in the last two years across each of these areas contributing to the improved revenue and profit margins 
general physics plans to continue to focus on growth in these areas in general physics also experienced an improvement in the training market in on december   eds made a payment of million  which included million of accrued interest  to general physics to satisfy its obligation under the arbitration award regarding the learning technologies acquisition 
general physics recognized a gain on arbitration settlement  net of legal fees and expenses  of million in the net cash proceeds to general physics was approximately million after legal fees and a million distribution to npdc 
on january   general physics used a portion of the proceeds to fully pay off its million of short term borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  general physics has no plans for any significant capital expenditures in  and expects the amounts generated from cash and operations and cash available for borrowing under its credit agreement of approximately million  to be sufficient to finance it s ongoing operations 
gse overview gse is a world leader in real time power plant simulation 
gse provides simulation solutions and services to the nuclear and fossil electric utility industry  as well as process industries such as the chemical and petrochemical industries 
in addition  gse provides plant monitoring  security access and control and signal analysis monitoring and optimization software primarily to the power industry 
gse enters with no bank debt and only  of other notes payable 
however  gse s backlog has decreased in  and gse is investing heavily in business development activities to expand its simulation business into the homeland security and us military industries 
gse s business is substantially dependent on sales to the nuclear power industry of revenue in 
spending by companies in this targeted industry is subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of industry cycles  economic conditions  political and regulatory environments and other factors  gse s efforts to expand its simulation business into the homeland security and us military industries may not generate sufficient revenues and margins in to offset the increased business development spending  gse relies on one customer  battelle s pacific northwest national laboratory of revenue in for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect upon gse s results 
sales of products and the provision of services to end users outside the united states accounted for approximately of gse s revenue in thus  gse is subject to risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy 
spin off of national patent development corporation in july  the company s board of directors approved a spin off of certain of its non core assets into a separate corporation  npdc  leaving the company s business comprised of its training and workforce development business operated by general physics and the gse simulation business 
the separation of these businesses was accomplished through a pro rata distribution the distribution of of the outstanding common stock of npdc to the company s stockholders on the record date of the distribution 
npdc is a stand alone public company owning all of the stock of mxl  the interest in five star and certain other non core assets 
following the spin off  the company ceased to have any ownership interest in npdc 
on march   the internal revenue service issued a favorable tax ruling  which enabled the distribution to be tax free 
in the spin off  holders of record on november  of gp strategies common stock and class b capital stock on november  received one share of npdc common stock for each share of gp strategies common stock or class b capital stock owned 
the spin off is expected to result in several benefits to the company and its shareholders 
by engaging in the spin off  the company believes that it will improve its access to capital and significantly improve its borrowing capacity  thereby facilitating its ability to raise additional funds as well as achieving other corporate benefits 
having two separate public companies will enable financial markets to better evaluate each company more effectively  thereby enhancing stockholder value over the long term and making the stock more attractive as currency for future acquisitions

contract awards continued to increase in for government training and domestic preparedness services 
the business process outsource organization received new contracts from both government and commercial clients at the end of and in to provide outsourced training management services 
the e learning organization was awarded several new contracts in with the us government to provide hosting and learning management systems integration services 
the segment also experienced a revenue increase of approximately million in related to hurricane relief services provided in the state of florida 
the company does not anticipate that these services will be a continuing stream of revenue going forward 
the overall increase in revenue was offset by a continued decline in training related revenue with certain automotive clients

selling  general and administrative expense the increase in sg a of million in from was primarily attributable the following factors million of sg a for the consolidation of gse in the company s financial statements subsequent to the gse acquisition  executive incentive bonuses of million  a non cash debt conversion expense of million  and a decrease in the non cash credit to compensation expense of million  relating to certain stock options to purchase stock of an affiliate accounted for using the fair value method 
the increase was offset by a decrease in severance and related expense of million 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in of million is primarily due to the write off of million of deferred financing costs as a result of the early termination of the company s prior credit agreement 
this expense is included in interest expense for year ended december  other income the investment and other loss of million for was primarily related to an equity loss of gse of million before its consolidation  offset by interest income on loans receivable of the gains on marketable securities of million in were primarily due to the company s disposal of shares of millennium

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
in addition the company had cash held in escrow of million from the eds arbitration award  of which the company received approximately million in january  net of the million distribution to npdc 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and borrowings availability under the credit agreement described below  will be sufficient to fund the working capital and other requirements of the company for the foreseeable future 
the company does not believe the spin off of npdc will significantly impact the company s liquidity 
for the year ended december   the company s working capital increased by million from million to million 
the company has increased working capital during the year ended december  mainly due to receiving the proceeds of the arbitration award against eds  as well as increases in current assets such as accounts receivable and unbilled receivables  due to increased revenues 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  resulted from cash used in investing activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million  offset by cash provided by operations of million and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million includes million of capital expenditures and million in additions to intangible assets  offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million

each year during the term of the note  mantech has the option to convert up to of the original principal amount of the note into common stock of the company at the then market price of the company s common stock  but only in the event that the company s common stock is trading at per share or more 
in the event that less than of the principal amount of the note is not converted in any year  such amount not converted will be eligible for conversion in each subsequent year until converted or until the note is repaid in cash 
on august   general physics  general physics subsidiary skillright  inc and mxl industries inc 
mxl entered into a two year million financing and security agreement credit agreement with a bank  the proceeds of which were used to repay the company s previous credit facility 
the interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement is at libor market index rate plus 
the credit agreement  as amended in march to include gse  is secured by certain assets of general physics 
the credit agreement also provides for an unsecured guaranty from the company 
the credit agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants including a prohibition on future acquisitions  incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends 
the company received a waiver under the credit agreement with respect to the gse acquisition 
general physics is currently restricted from paying dividends and management fees to the company in excess of million in any fiscal year 
on july   general physics received a waiver and paid the company an additional million 
the company repaid in full the million outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  in january of  using the proceeds received from the eds arbitration award see item 
on march   general physics received a waiver to loan gse a maximum of million to satisfy any gse short term capital requirements over the next months 
pursuant to a note and warrant purchase agreement dated august   the company issued and sold to four gabelli funds million aggregate principal amount of conditional subordinated notes due and  warrants  each entitling the holder thereof to purchase subject to adjustment one share of the company s common stock 
the aggregate purchase price for the gabelli notes and gp warrants was million 
the gabelli notes are secured by a mortgage on the company s former property located in pawling  new york which was distributed to npdc 
in addition  at any time that less than million principal amount of the gabelli notes are outstanding  the company may defease the obligations secured by the mortgage and obtain a release of the mortgage by depositing with an agent for the noteholders  bonds or government securities with an investment grade rating by a nationally recognized rating agency which  without reinvestment  will provide cash on the maturity date of the gabelli notes in an amount not less than the outstanding principal amount of the gabelli notes 
the company used million of the proceeds to repay its previous credit facility 
the company and npdc agreed to allocate to npdc million of the million received for the gabelli notes and warrants  which the company transferred to npdc prior to the spin off of npdc 
on march   gse was added as an additional borrower under the general physics credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  as amended  million of general physics credit agreement has been allocated for use by gse 
the credit agreement was amended to provide for additional collateral consisting of substantially all of the gse s assets as well as certain covenants specific to gse 
it provides for borrowings by gse up to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible unbilled receivables  up to a maximum of million 
the interest rate is based upon the libor market index rate plus  with interest only payments due monthly

as part of this transaction  the landlords of the new jersey and connecticut facilities did not consent to the release of the company s guarantee 
the company s guarantee of five star s leases was not affected by the spin off of npdc 
general physics has two letters of credit outstanding  which as of december  amount to approximately million and expire in in addition the company guarantees mxl loans totaling approximately million as of december the company does not have any off balance sheet financing  other than operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the normal course of business and disclosed above 
gse utilizes various derivative financial instruments to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
it is gse s policy to use derivative financial instruments to protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business 
the criteria gse uses for designating an instrument as a hedge includes the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gse monitors its foreign currency exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro and the japanese yen 
gse s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to reduce the impact of these exposures 
gse minimizes credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions 
as of december   gse had contracts for the sale of approximately million japanese yen at fixed rates 
the contracts expire on various dates through may  the contracts do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
 as amended 
accordingly  gse has recorded the estimated fair value of the contracts of approximately  as of december  as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
management discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include contract revenue and cost recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  accounting for investments  impairment of long lived and intangible assets and income tax recognition of deferred tax items which are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
contract revenue and cost recognition 
revenue recognition general physics contract revenue and cost recognition 
general physics provides services under time and materials  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts 
each contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  requiring general physics to make judgments and estimates about recognizing revenue 
in general  revenue is recognized on these arrangements as the services are performed 
under time and material contracts  as well as certain cost plus fixed fee and certain fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are based on the specified level of resources general physics is obligated to provide 
as a result  on those level of effort contracts  the contractual billing amount for a given period acts as a measure of performance and  therefore  revenue is typically recognized in that amount 
for other fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are not based on the specified level of resources general physics is obligated to provide 
these arrangements typically do not have milestones or other reliable measures of performance 
as a result  revenue on these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract 
general physics believes this methodology provides a reasonable measure of performance on these arrangements since performance primarily involves personnel costs and the customer typically is required to pay general physics for the proportionate amount of work and cost incurred in the event of contract termination 
revenue for unpriced change orders is not recognized until the customer agrees with the changes 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current asset 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current liability 
generally contracts provide for the billing of costs incurred and estimated earnings on a monthly basis 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered when making estimates of total contract cost  contract profitability and progress towards completion 
if sufficient risk exists  a reduced profit methodology is applied to a specific client contract s percentage of completion model whereby the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of costs incurred until such time as the risks have been partially or wholly mitigated through performance 
general physics estimates of total contract cost and contract profitability change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of contractual arrangements 
in addition  the implementation of cost saving initiatives and achievement of productivity gains generally results in a reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
such changes in estimate are recognized in the period the changes are determined 
for all client contracts  provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
as part of general physics on going operations to provide services to its customers  incidental expenses  which are commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses  are billed to customers  either directly as a pass through cost or indirectly as a cost estimated in proposing on fixed price contracts 
out of pocket expenses include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals and telecommunication charges 
general physics policy provides for these expenses to be recorded as both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
gse revenue recognition 
the majority of gse s revenue is derived through the sale of uniquely designed systems containing hardware  software and other materials under fixed price contracts 
in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the revenue under these fixed price contracts is accounted for on the percentage of completion method  based on contract costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete 
estimated contract earnings are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and the cumulative effect of any change is recognized in the period in which the change is identified 
estimated losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified 
as gse recognizes revenue under the percentage of completion method  it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical and projected claims experience 
gse s longer term contracts generally provide for a one year warranty on parts  labor and any bug fixes as it relates to software embedded in the systems 
gse s system design contracts do not provide for post customer support service pcs in terms of software upgrades  software enhancements or telephone support 
in order to obtain pcs  the customers must purchase a separate contract at the date of system installation 
such pcs arrangements are generally for a one year period renewable annually and include customer support  unspecified software upgrades  maintenance releases 
gse recognizes revenue from these contracts ratably over the life of the agreements in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of software licenses for the company s modeling tools  which do not require significant modification or customization  are recognized when the license agreement is signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from certain consulting or training contracts are recognized on a time and material basis 
for time and material type contracts  revenue is recognized based on hours incurred at a contracted labor rate plus expenses 
valuation of accounts receivables provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on specific credit risks identified by the company 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of the historical loss experience of the company and its subsidiaries  judgments about customer credit risk and the need to adjust for current economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives result in a charge to operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived tangible assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by determining the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the measurement of the future net cash flows to be generated is subject to management s reasonable expectations with respect to the company s future operations and future economic conditions which may affect those cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify its reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
the company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
the company estimates these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value in both tests conducted in and indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any reporting unit below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this would require a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
the following table presents goodwill balances at december  and operating income for the years ended december   and for each of the company s reportable segments in thousands operating income for the goodwill at years ended december  december  general physics     gse  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon these factors  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance relates to both foreign and domestic net operating loss carryforwards for which the company does not believe the benefits will be realized 
in  the company s taxable income before utilization of net operating loss carry forwards was approximately million 
in assessing the realizability of it s deferred tax assets  management considered it more likely than not that it s deferred tax assets would be realized and reduced it s valuation allowance by million 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of million  which expire during and recent accounting pronouncements during december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard entitled statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
among other items  the new standard would require the expensing  in the financial statements  of stock options issued by the company 
the new standard will be effective july   for calendar year companies 
gp strategies is currently evaluating the adoption of sfas no 
r  including the valuation methods and assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs internal processes to manage its exposure to interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
the company s objective in managing its interest rate risk is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company is exposed to the impact of currency fluctuations because of its international operations 
as of december   the company had approximately million of variable rate borrowings 
the company estimates that for every fluctuation in general interest rates  assuming debt levels at december   interest expense would vary by  as of december   gse had contracts for the sale of approximately million japanese yen at fixed rates 
the contracts expire on various dates through may  the contracts do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
 as amended 
accordingly  gse has recorded the estimated fair value of the contracts of approximately  as of december  as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries  including intercompany balances  at december  was immaterial  and accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency do not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
the company s revenues and profitability are related to general levels of economic activity and employment in the united states and the united kingdom 
as a result  any significant economic downturn or recession in one or both of those countries could harm our business and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is derived from fortune level companies and their international equivalents  which historically have adjusted expenditures for external training during economic downturns 
if the economies in which these companies operate weaken in any future period  these companies may not increase or may reduce their expenditures on external training  which could adversely affect the company s business and financial condition
