item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital 
the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the corporation and first federal are classified as well capitalized 
fdicia also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within these five categories  with progressively more severe restrictions on operations  management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed 
failure to meet capital requirements can also cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital 
fdicia also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation  and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the fdic have each adopted risk based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines also provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 
the agencies also jointly adopted a regulation  effective january   amending their regulatory capital standards to change the treatment of certain recourse obligations  direct credit subsidies  residual interest and other positions in securitized transactions that expose banking organizations to credit risk 
the regulation amends the agencies regulatory capital standards to align more closely the risk based capital treatment of recourse obligations and direct credit subsidies  to vary the capital requirements for positions in securitized transactions and certain other credit exposures according to their relative risk  and to require capital commensurate with the risks associated with residual interests 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines can subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and under some conditions the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
deposit insurance 
our deposits are insured by the fdic up to the statutory maximum limit of  per depositor through the savings association insurance fund 
for this protection  we must pay semiannual assessments to the fdic 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic  which will be determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
dividends 
the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the majority of our revenue is from dividends paid to it by the bank 
the bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends they can pay 
if  in the opinion of a federal regulatory agency  an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice  the agency may require  after notice and hearing  that the institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under fdicia  an insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
moreover  the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
under kentucky law  dividends by kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits 
before any dividend may be declared for any period other than with respect to preferred stock  a bank must increase its capital surplus by at least of the net profits of the bank for the period until the bank s capital surplus equals the amount of its stated capital attributable to its common stock 
moreover  the kdfi commissioner must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt 
we are also subject to the kentucky business corporation act  which generally prohibits dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or if becoming unable to pay debts as they come due 
consumer protection laws 
we are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population 
these laws include the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the truth in lending act  the home mortgage disclosure act  and the real estate settlement procedures act  and state law counterparts 
federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protections provisions 
under these provisions  a financial institution must provide to its customers  at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
these provisions also provide that  except for certain limited exceptions  an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
federal law makes it a criminal offense  except in limited circumstances  to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 
the community reinvestment act cra requires the fdic to assess our record in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve  including low and moderate income neighborhoods and persons 
the fdic s assessment of our record is made available to the public 
the assessment also is part of the federal reserve board s consideration of applications to acquire  merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company  to establish a new branch office or to relocate an office 
the federal reserve board will also assess the cra record of the subsidiary banks of a bank holding company in connection with an application to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
bank secrecy act 
the bank secrecy act of bsa was enacted to deter money laundering  establish regulatory reporting standards for currency transactions and improve detection and investigation of criminal  tax and other regulatory violations 
bsa and subsequent laws and regulations require us to take steps to prevent the use of the bank in the flow of illegal or illicit money  including  without limitation  ensuring effective management oversight  establishing sound policies and procedures  developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities  ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of bsa compliance activities 
in recent years  federal regulators have increased the attention paid to compliance with the provisions of bsa and related laws  with particular attention paid to know your customer practices 
banks have been encouraged by regulators to enhance their identification procedures prior to accepting new customers in order to deter criminal elements from using the banking system to move and hide illegal and illicit activities 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act contains anti money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions  broker dealers and certain other financial institutions 
the patriot act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism  including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  and grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions operations 
in addition  the patriot act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions 
business risk we  like other financial companies  are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside of management s control  though we strive to manage those risks while optimizing returns 
among the risks assumed are a credit risk  which is the risk that loan and lease customers or other counter parties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations  b market risk  which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation  c liquidity risk  which is the risk that we will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet our operating needs  and d operational risk  which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems  or from external events 
in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report  readers should consider that the following important factors  among others  could materially impact our business  future results of operations  and future cash flows 
a credit risk we extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and the judgment of management 
we manage the credit risk it takes through a program of underwriting standards that we follow  the review of certain credit decisions  and an on going process of assessment of the quality of the credit we have already extended 
there can be no assurance that our credit standards and our on going process of credit assessment will protect us from significant credit losses 
our loans and deposits are focused in central kentucky and adverse economic conditions in that state  in particular  could negatively impact results from operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
adverse economic conditions and other factors  such as political or business development or natural hazards that may affect kentucky  may reduce demand for credit or fee based products and could negatively affect real estate and other collateral values  interest rate levels  and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity 
b market risk changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates 
if our interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period  a decrease in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
likewise  if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
at december   our total loans were million 
of this total  had adjustable interest rates or were within one year of maturity and had fixed interest rates 
fixed rate loans increase our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks  such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interests rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates 
under these circumstances  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
when evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure  the primary measurement represents scenarios that model a basis point increasing decreasing parallel shift in rates over the next twelve month period versus rates implied by the current yield curve 
at the end of  that scenario modeled net interest income to be approximately lower than the internal forecast of net interest income using the baseline scenario if rates were to decrease basis points in a parallel shift and higher than the internal forecast of net interest income using the baseline scenario if rates were to increase basis points in a parallel shift 
this position is well within the board of directors policy limit for change in net interest income given a basis point change in rates 
although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor controllable  our asset liability committee meets periodically to monitor our interest rate sensitivity position and oversee its financial risk management by establishing policies and operating limits 
for further discussion  see the asset liability management and market risk section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
c liquidity risk if we are unable to borrow funds through access to the capital markets  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  or meet the operating cash needs of the corporation to fund corporate expansion or other activities 
liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors  with operating limits set by the asset liability committee alco  based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  the percentage of assets funded with non core or wholesale funding 
alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the bank and holding company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
the liquidity of the bank is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
the alco establishes board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify our wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
wholesale funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core brokered deposits  and medium and long term debt  which includes federal home loan bank fhlb advances that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other sources of liquidity should they be needed 
these include the sale or securitization of loans  the ability to acquire additional non core brokered deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as fhlb advances  the issuance of debt securities  and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might be unable to meet the needs of our customers  which could adversely impact our financial condition  our results of operations  cash flows  and our level of regulatory qualifying capital 
for further discussion  see the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
d operational risk we have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loans 
competition is intense in most of the markets we serve 
we compete on price and service with other banks and financial companies such as savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage banking companies  and brokerage firms 
competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation  the increasing availability of products and services from non banks  greater technological developments in the industry  and banking reform 
management maintains internal operational controls and we have invested in technology to help us process large volumes of transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions 
if our systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected  if our systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner  or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls  significant losses could occur 
we process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operation risk 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk 
while not foolproof  these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate  cost effective levels 
we have also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics  and business practices are followed 
from time to time  we experience loss from operational risk  including the effects of operational errors 
while management continually monitors and improves our system of internal controls  data processing systems  and corporate wide processes and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
new  or changes in existing tax  accounting  are regulatory laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a financial company s shareholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading regulation 
these regulations  along with currently existing tax  accounting  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
events that may not have a direct impact on us  such as the bankruptcy of us companies  have resulted in legislators  regulators  and authoritative bodies  such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  the public company accounting oversight board  and other various taxing authorities responding by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations  or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
however  it is impossible to predict at this time  the extent to which any such adoption  change  or repeal would impact us

this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview we conduct operations in full service banking centers in six contiguous counties in kentucky along the interstate corridor 
our market presence ranges from the major metropolitan market of louisville in jefferson county  kentucky approximately miles north of our headquarters in elizabethtown  kentucky to hart county  kentucky  approximately miles south of elizabethtown 
our core markets have experienced a compound annual growth rate of in deposits for the past four years 
we anticipate a similar growth rate of our markets for the next few years and believe we are well positioned to benefit from this continued growth 
during the year  we opened two new full service facilities in the growing louisville market and redesigned one of our existing hardin county facilities 
we anticipate the redesign of our mt 
washington facility in bullitt county to be completed in the first quarter of we intend to start construction on a new full service banking center in elizabethtown during with plans of opening in early these facilities represent our state of the art prototype branch with a retail focused design 
this design features an internet caf with access to online banking and bill payment services 
large plasma screens decorate the lobby providing customers with current news and information about bank products and services as well as upcoming community events 
the facilities are staffed to offer a full range of financial services to the growing retail and commercial customer base 
we believe these facilities will allow us to more effectively support our lending relationships in louisville and to develop a larger presence within that market in the future 
while we fully anticipate these facilities to significantly enhance the value of our franchise in the near future  the additional expense in operating these new facilities will continue to place pressure on earnings for a period of time 
we are optimistic that our expansion strategy for louisville will minimize this period and the long term benefits will outweigh the initial investment 
we are focused on expanding our leadership role in our markets emphasizing both the retail and commercial lines of business 
in addition to expanding our leadership position  we are also focused on maintaining a high level of profitability 
we identified several key factors to support these initiatives including emphasize commercial lending expand our retail base in our current branches as well as in growing markets within our region sustain our excellent credit quality grow non interest income maintain an operationally efficient organization 
we have increased our return on equity from in  to in the increase in return on equity was accompanied by a compound annual growth rate of in diluted earning per share over the same period of time 
while management believes opportunities for improvement exist  it attributes much of the improvement in return on equity to our ability to implement the elements of our strategic initiative 
emphasize commercial lending our emphasis on commercial lending continued to produce positive results generating a million  or increase in commercial loans to million at december   compared to million at december  this favorable trend has resulted in a annual compound growth rate over the past four years 
the percentage of commercial loans in our portfolio has increased from at december   to at december  while residential loans declined from at december   to at december  the portfolio mix also changed significantly during as commercial loans grew from to of the total loan portfolio 
we intend to continue this commercial lending emphasis and anticipate continued increases in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 
expand our retail base in our current branches as well as in growing markets within our region in january  we implemented an effort to develop a bank wide service and sales culture emphasizing expanded account relationships 
to achieve this goal  we increased the number of associates in banking centers  relationship bankers  business development officers  stockbrokers  and loan officers with experience in commercial lending 
the results of this effort as well as our transition from a federally chartered thrift to a state chartered commercial bank in january  have contributed to our growth 
the resulting increase in staff along with the expansion into the metro louisville market have contributed to a  or increase in employee compensation expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we expect a continued increase in employee compensation expense in the calendar year as we continue our expansion into our current markets 
maintain an operationally efficient organization despite the increase in employee compensation expense for  we still maintained an efficiency ratio of for the year ended december   an increase from in  but comparable to in the following discussion and analysis covers the primary factors affecting our performance and financial condition 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses is critical to the understanding of our results of operations since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio and the executive loan committee evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we estimate the allowance required using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses  in part  based on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account our strategic plan to increase our emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
we increase the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
allowance estimates are developed in consultation with regulatory authorities and actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was the estimate of losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million during if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially affected 
results of operations net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in the increase in diluted earnings per share was due to a stock repurchase of  shares of our own common stock  which decreased to capital by million 
the decrease in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in non interest expense of million for the period compared to  the direct result of our expansion efforts 
our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
we reported net income of million during the year ended december  compared with million for the period 
diluted earnings per share increased from during to for earnings remained relatively constant for the comparative periods 
favorable increases in non interest income generated from the gain on sale of mortgage loans  service charges on deposit accounts  and two lots held for sale were offset by a decline in net interest income as well as an increase in non interest expense 
our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated return on average assets of and return on average equity of 
these compare with return on average assets of and return on average equity of for the period 
we reported net income of million during the six months ended december  compared with million for the same period ended  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share increased from 
during to for the increase in earnings for was primarily attributable to increased net interest income  and an absence of goodwill amortization  service charges on deposit accounts and gain on sale of mortgage loans 
our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for the six months ended december  generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as market interest rates 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets increased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the period 
net interest margin continued to benefit from a decrease in interest expense on deposits as well as the increase in the yield on our variable rate commercial loans 
our cost of funds averaged during  a decrease of basis points from the average cost of funds of 
the improvement was the result of the continued re pricing of certificate of deposit maturities rolling off at higher rates into current lower interest rates  as well as the continued decrease in certificate of deposit balances as a percentage of total deposits 
going forward  our cost of funds is expected to increase as the general market deposit rates have become increasingly competitive with the recent upward trend in interest rates 
the yield on earning assets was for the period  a decrease from for the period 
the decrease in the yield on earning assets was primarily the result of a decrease in mortgage loans as customers refinanced their mortgage loans elsewhere  or the loans were sold to the secondary market 
we were successful in increasing the balance of commercial loans over that same time frame 
in addition to changing the mix of assets in the loan portfolio  the shift also increased the percentage of variable rate loans in the portfolio  which will increase the yield in an increasing interest rate environment 
we increased our prime lending rate basis points since the federal open market committee began increasing short term interest rates in june management expects its yield on loans to improve with additional increases in the prime lending rate 
the net result of the above factors has resulted in an increase in net interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended in for additional analysis on the effect of increasing and decreasing interest rates on the corporation s net interest margin  see the interest rate sensitivity model under asset liability management and market risk 
net interest income for the year ended december  declined to million compared to million for the period due to a narrowing net interest margin 
our net interest margin declined from for to for the net interest rate spread decreased from during to in the net interest margin declined due to a reduction in short term market interest rates by the federal reserve  which occurred in january customer deposit interest rates did not adjust downward as quickly to offset declining interest yields on loans and investments 
additionally  lower interest rates encouraged a large volume of residential refinancing in favor of the secondary market loans  reducing our residential mortgage loan portfolio 
during the period  residential mortgage loans held in our portfolio decreased by million as a majority of the new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations were sold during the substitution of commercial and commercial real estate loans for residential mortgage loans has resulted in a declining yield on our loan portfolio 
for the six months ended december   net interest income was million  up million from the million attained during the comparable period of we were able to increase net interest income through growth in our interest earning assets and declines in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin remained steady at for the six months ended december  as compared to for the six month period 
the net interest rate spread increased from during or in the net interest spread and margin benefited from a significant decline in our cost of funds due to a reduction on short term market interest rates by the federal reserve  which occurred principally during calendar our cost of funds averaged during  a decrease of basis points from the average cost of funds of compared to a decrease of basis points on interest earning assets from to 
the period includes subordinated debt  which was issued in march although substantially all categories of interest income and interest expense declined during  interest rates payable on deposit products generally declined more than rates on interest bearing assets 
during the period  average interest earning assets were million  an increase of million over the same period in total average interest bearing liabilities increased from million during or million for the same period in average balance sheets the following table sets forth information relating to the bank s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated

the increased level of non interest income during was primarily due to an increase in customer service fees on deposit accounts  gain on sale of investments  gain on sale of real estate held for development and other income due to our investment in bank owned life insurance 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in the gain on sale of mortgage loans for  resulting from a decline in refinancing activity

this source of non interest income will largely be eliminated with our decision to outsource our trust operations 
in conjunction  we estimate trust expenses of approximately  will be eliminated from salary and benefit expense 
customer service fees on deposit accounts increased  due to growth in customer deposits  and an increase in overdraft fee income on retail checking accounts

non interest expense non interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to the primary factors impacting non interest expense include additional operating and employee compensation expenses relating to the recent retail expansion efforts 
employee compensation and benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  increased  or for twenty retail staff positions have been added since the third quarter a year ago for the expansion in louisville coupled with an expanded facility in hardin county  kentucky 
additional increases in staff have taken place throughout the year as we strengthen our retail sales culture and provide expanded products and services to our retail and commercial customers 
the increase in compensation was also attributable to an increase in our self funded health insurance program due to an increase in the amount of health insurance claims 
our efficiency ratio was at december  compared to for the two full service branch openings have significantly contributed to higher operating costs including a  increase in office occupancy and equipment expense  additional postage for promotions and direct mailings for marketing  along with increased communications  and supplies expense 
bank franchise tax expense increased  year to date due to a higher tax expense accrual resulting from the conversion from a federally chartered thrift to a kentucky state chartered commercial bank 
the state tax expense for a bank charter is calculated based upon different rules resulting in an increase for we anticipate the increased level of non interest expense to continue into with continued retail expansion and market share protection efforts 
we anticipate a major expansion of our mt 
washington  ky location will be completed during we intend to start construction on a new full service banking center in elizabethtown  ky during with plans of opening in early we are also considering other possible locations within the core market area to protect and grow our market share 
non interest expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to the most significant factors impacting non interest expense for the period include an increase in staffing levels and employee benefits expense  and a change in accounting rules that discontinued amortization of goodwill from acquisitions 
our efficiency ratios were and for the years ended december  and employee compensation and benefits increased million or for the increase in employee compensation reflects higher incentive bonuses due to certain corporate performance objectives being met  coupled with growth in the overall staffing level from full time equivalent employees at december  to full time equivalent employees at december  as a result of adopting new accounting standards on july   we ceased annual amortization of  on remaining goodwill assets of million 
accordingly  no amortization expense was recognized for the year ended december  or the six months ended december  the new standards require annual impairment testing for goodwill with impairment being recorded if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
these tests have not resulted in any impairments 
all other non interest expenses increased  to million during the period compared to non interest expense increased by  or during the six month period ended december  compared to the same period in factors impacting non interest expense included an increase in staffing levels and a change in accounting rules in which goodwill amortization expense from acquisitions is no longer recorded 
our efficiency ratio improved to in compared to in employee compensation and benefits increased  or for the increase reflects growth in the overall staffing level from full time equivalent employees at december  to at december  our continued emphasis on building our commercial and retail staff to reflect our commercial philosophy was the largest contributing factor 
goodwill amortization expense reported for the six months ended december  was  compared to zero for the six months ended december  analysis of financial condition total assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily related to an increase in investment securities of million and an increase in net loans receivable of million 
the growth in investment securities and loans was principally funded with cash and cash equivalents  which decreased by million  and deposits  which increased by million 
total assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december  the available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios increased during the period due to investments in equity securities and two mortgage backed securities with fixed rate terms of five and seven years 
also  during the period  we invested million in bank owned life insurance 
net loans receivable increased million from december  to million at december  loans receivable net loans receivable increased million or to million at december  compared to million at december  our commercial  commercial real estate  and real estate construction portfolios increased million  a increase in these loans to million at december  for the period  these loans comprised of the total loan portfolio compared to of the loan portfolio at december   and of the loan portfolio at december  also  contributing to the increase was a million increase in consumer loans 
offsetting this growth was a million  or decrease in the residential mortgage loan portfolio to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was due to an increase in customer refinancing activity into fixed rate  secondary market loan products 
for  the decline in mortgage loans is expected to slow from the decreases experienced in and early the growth in commercial loans is expected to continue in line with recent trends 
residential mortgage loans decreased by million during the period as declining market interest rates caused an increase in family refinancing activity into fixed rate  secondary market loan products

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the executive loan committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the allowance is determined based on the application of loss estimates to graded loans by categories 
the amount of the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain an adequate allowance is also based upon an analysis of such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account our strategic plan to increase our emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
we increase the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
the indirect consumer loan program is comprised of new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicle loans originated on our behalf by a select group of auto dealers within the our service area 
the indirect loan program involves a greater degree of risk and is evaluated quarterly and monitored by the board of directors 
in light of the greater charge offs from indirect consumer loans compared to direct consumer loans  proportionally more of the allowance for consumer loans is allocated for indirect loans than direct loans 
as the indirect loan program has evolved  dealer analysis and underwriting standards have been refined to improve the loan loss experience of the program 
estimating the allowance is a continuous process 
in this regard  the executive loan committee continues to monitor the performance of indirect consumer loans as well as our other loan products and updates estimates as the evidence warrants

net loan charge offs increased  to  during compared to  during  due to an increase in commercial loan net charge offs 
the provision for loan losses decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the period 
the higher provision expense for was due to a change in loan types 
the total allowance for loan losses increased  to million from december  to december  we increased the allowance for loan losses due to the continued strong growth in commercial real estate lending and changes in the product mix within the loan portfolios 
net loan charge offs decreased  to  during compared to  during the decrease in charge offs is primarily related to a decrease in charge offs of indirect consumer loans during the period 
the provision for loan losses was million for the six months ended december  compared to  for the six month period 
the total allowance for loan losses increased  to million from june  to december  we increased the provision and allowance for loan losses due to a change in the loan classification and charge off estimates  the increase in non performing loans  which reflected the generally recognized slowing in the economy  and continued strong growth in commercial real estate lending 
net loan charge offs decreased  to  during the six month period compared to  during the decrease in charge offs is primarily related to an increase in recoveries of consumer and commercial loan charge offs during the period 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance funding and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention and a specific allowance category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  we had million of assets classified substandard   classified as doubtful  million classified as special mention and  of assets classified as loss 
loans are classified according to estimated loss as follows substandard to  doubtful to  loss  and special mention to 
we additionally provide a reserve estimate for probable incurred losses in non classified loans ranging from 
to 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
allowance estimates are developed in consultation with regulatory authorities and actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans greater than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans under sfas  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible by management and any available collateral has been disposed of 
commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis by management with the advice of legal counsel 
we anticipate that the volume of non performing real estate loans will continue to increase  reflecting anticipated growth of our loan portfolio 
interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when interest accrual is discontinued  existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense

the restructured loans primarily consist of three credit relationships aggregating million  including a million commercial relationship  a  commercial relationship and a  residential mortgage relationship 
the terms of these loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest and extend the term thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the terms of the restructured loans are currently being met

deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years we have been required by market conditions to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of their use on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network we have undertaken a renewed emphasis on growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value  as well as lower our dependence on certificate of deposit funding 
during  we introduced new checking account products and significant enhancements to existing products 
a heightened level of advertising and promotions coupled with associate incentive plans designed to encourage the sale of checking accounts should enable us to make progress with this effort 
we rely primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
during the year ended december   total deposits increased by million compared to the period 
the increase in retail deposits was primarily in money market accounts due to growth in public entity deposits for the period and an increase in certificate of deposit balances as we have become increasingly competitive with rates in recent months 
to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current low rate environment  while protecting the margin when interest rates increase as the economy recovers 
we offer statement and passbook savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by management on a periodic basis 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms and interest rates 
these certificates have minimum deposit requirements as well 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  our ability to attract and maintain deposits and its cost of funds have been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions

the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  are met  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
liquidity risk management also includes ensuring cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reviewed by the asset liability committee 
funds are available from a number of sources  including the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal paydowns on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds realized from loans held for sale  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding

lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
we have an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management polices 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income are then evaluated 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at both december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables presented below  we are continuing to transition away from a liability sensitive to an asset sensitive position as compared to prior periods in anticipation of rising interest rates for the next several months 
the change in our asset sensitivity is a result of changes in the loan portfolio to a greater extent than changes in the investment portfolio 
while lending practices have shifted to shorter term  variable rate commercial and consumer loans  that impact will be evidenced in smaller degrees over time 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes is presented based on data as of december  and december  december  decrease in rates increase in rates basis points basis points base basis points basis points dollars in thousands projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base december  decrease in rates increase in rates basis points basis points base basis points basis points dollars in thousands projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base
